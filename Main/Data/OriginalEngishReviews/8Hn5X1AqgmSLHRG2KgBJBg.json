Better yet, load the back of your pickup with a generator, a wide screen TV and your favorite game console.  Or better yet, bring a DVD player, your favorite movie and some lawn chairs and make everyone happy.  Cause you'll all be sitting there for a very long time.  You will finish the movie.

OK so if I was alone I would still get seated at a 2 or 4 top so whats the BFD if she hasn\'t arrived yet!\n\nI wait and look at the menu, which they have redone since my last visit, what an eye-crossing mess they turned it into.\n\nYAY! Andrea arrives we get seated and order our drinks. The waiter does not tell Andrea that the Ice tea is flavored, she asks if he minded getting her a soda instead.  Waiting for that soda...................................\nSince we are seated right next to the drink station I offer to grab her soda for her........I pretty much get yelled at by some waitress,she gets it for her instead.\n\nOK so I ended up ordering something I have never tried before the "Veggie Wedgie" (wedge-cut foccocia bread  with dusted sauteed eggplant, fresh portabello mushrooms and provolone cheese and baked. It\'s then stuffed with roma tomatoes, spinach, goat cheese and feta cheese, along with an aioli dressing placed on the side for dipping.) And a small dinner salad.\n\nThey have also changed the salads since my last visit, it used to be romaine and mozzarella now its spring greens and gorgonzola.......either way its good.\n\nMy sandwich arrives and each half is bigger than my head,WOW!\n it looks good too.............Looks can be deceiving....it was not so good.....the eggplant was bland and cold, the sandwich did not seem "baked" enough and over all not really much flavor going on, and how on earth they thought I could dip that huge thing into their tiny cup of Over garlicked aioli is beyond me.\n\nWhen waiter boy comes by I tell him its not so good, he takes it away with no hesitation. Manager come by and offers me something else, I really am full and didn\'t want anything but let him oblige me with a slice anyhow. I really am against getting any other food items after having to send something back....\n\nOut comes my slice.........well cheese is sliding to one side and it\'s covered in a black soot as is the pineapple....maybe it fell on the floor to teach me a lesson??? I should have took a picture! All the other slices I saw go by looked pristine...what happened to mine?\n\nI wasn\'t planning on eating it anyway, I was full.\n\nI apologize to the waiter about the sandwich again and her assures me that its no problem they always encourage people to try something new, if you don\'t like it they will take it off the bill no problem. ~I thought that was great customer service on their part.\n\nSo they did take off my sandwich and my slice from the bill, Thanks Again guys!\n\n~Andrea and I are still chatting.........\n~Waiter: "can I get you some boxes?"\n~ Us: "OK"\n5 minutes later\n~Waiter: "Do you need help boxing that up?"\n~US: "No thanks"\n5 minutes later\n~ Waiter: "Can I Get you a to go cup for your drinks?"\n\nGeesh I Think we can take a hint, I guess we\'ll get going....there wasn\'t any people waiting to be sat so whats the rush??\n\n3 stars for Their hospitable understanding over the bad sandwich', 'business_id': '8Hn5X1AqgmSLHRG2KgBJBg', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2008-04-07', 'type': 'review'}

The wine, beer, and cocktails available are also very nice and affordable at about $5 each.  They even sell shirts there for a reasonable price, if you're a huge fan like me!  There are many things on the menu that I haven't tried, I admit.  Some of that is due to the large amounts of meat in most dishes.  Otherwise, it's simply because I'm too hungry to wait for the 30-40 minute wait times many menu items incur.  I bring my out-of-town guests here when they're craving Italian.

Our waitress was so relaxed and willing to help, she finally took pity on us and suggested two dishes - which we jumped on.\n\nThe Big Rig Pasta was SO YUMMY! A+ for her first suggestion...though I wish I could say the same for her other suggestion. The stuffed mushrooms which was her second suggestion were "eh." I\'m not going to hold it against her though because she was just trying to help us. The mushrooms weren\'t that great, I think it had more to do with the sausage which the mushrooms were stuffed with and the overall texture of all the ingredients, just didn\'t do it for us. But I\'d like to mention that even though these mushrooms were a bit gross, they were still 100% better than anything I ate at Avalon in Scottsdale. I\'d rather eat stuffed mushrooms for the rest of my life then eat another dish at Avalon.\n\nI am so bummbed though because even though I only took  a few bites of the mushrooms, I basically stuffed my face with the Big Rig dish and so at the end I was so full I couldn\'t eat their one dessert - which is what I wanted to order first but my boyfriend wouldn\'t let me until I had "real food" first.

It\'s pretty conveniently located near Mill and University, close by to all the bars at Mill.  The atmosphere is great, very relaxed and casual, without the usual pompous and fake Italian restaurant feel.  It is full of college kids most of the time, so atmosphere is a bit more lively than most other family restaurants.  You have the choice of sitting at the bar, inside booths or an outside table.  I like it outside as long as it\'s not in the summer, but they do have misters and shade so it\'s not all that bad.  Like some of the other reviewers noted, wait time can exceed even an hour around peak dinner and lunch times.  If you go off peak say around an hour after the usual lunch or dinner times, then you can get seated right away or maybe a 15 min wait at max.  \n\nThe pizza is the best thing here, there\'s a bunch of choices or you can build your own.  I\'m quite fond of the Frisco and the \'45 minute wait\' stuffed crust.  But I recommend having an appetizer or two before dinner, I love the wings (Wings of fire and Royal gold are the best) or the garlic bread.  Another good starter is the Beafstro salad but it\'s a humongous plate of beef and salad, the best of all worlds.  I also like their numerous sandwiches, and various pasta combinations.  Baked ziti is amazing and like pretty much every other item on the menu it\'s huge.  You should definitely top your experience off with a pazookie for dessert, it\'s absolutely delicious, I get one every time I go.\n\nThe prices are great too, their 18" pizzas is about 20$ and it\'ll comfortably feed 2-4 depending on how hungry you are.  Also you can definitely share any of the other items, making this place a perfect place to have a very cozy and intimate meal.', 'business_id': '8Hn5X1AqgmSLHRG2KgBJBg', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2009-05-28', 'type': 'review'}

I've eaten at the Tempe, Mesa, Old Town, and North Scottsdale locations and I've never been let down. The Tempe location was my first Oreganos experience and also the location I've been to the most. I have never had a bad meal at Oreganos and rarely had just ok meals. It literally has something everyone will like it just may take a few samples to get dialed in to your go to meal. The Pablo Picasso with chicken salad is my favorite salad that I have ever had and continues to be time and time again. The Big Rig Pasta with chicken is one of my favorite pastas anywhere as well. Both are slightly spicy but not to the point that it keeps my anti-spicy friends from enjoying it too. If I'm in a pizza mood a simple Oreganos thin crust pepperoni is delicious and always hits the spot! But my friends also rave about some of the more exotic pizza choices on the menu. Another friend favorite is the meatball sub which I've never heard a bad thing about. Finally, for dessert, the Pizza Cookie or Pizookie or whatever you call it is amazing! I am not a dessert person by any means but this thing is sooooo good! A perfectly slightly undercooked cookie topped with ice cream! Can't beat it! No matter how full you are from the enormous portions you can't leave without trying one of these masterpieces, you'll thank me after! Get one to share and it will disappear fast. I love the original chocolate chip cookie with vanilla but they also offer peanut butter and white chocolate macadamia.

So here goes my review so I can add on to my list.\n\nThis is a great place for dining in a big group. My friends and I like to get together for dinner here sometimes. There are pizzas (and many variations of it), wings, salads, sandwiches and pastas on the menu. There's bound to something for everyone here which makes group dining easier. \n\nFor the pizza, you can choose between thin, stuffed or pan crusts. I always go for the thin crust and my favorite is the chicken pesto one. They have signature pizzas or you can create your own. There are many different toppings to choose from (even carnitas & cotija cheese) and the combinations are endless. \n\nI also like that they have my favorite type of wings here- golden wings. Yummy. And they are quite large, too. \n\nFor dessert, share a pizza cookie. It comes hot out of the oven and topped with some ice cream. Perfect ending to close out a meal.", 'business_id': '8Hn5X1AqgmSLHRG2KgBJBg', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2011-02-07', 'type': 'review'}

Oregano's was getting glowing reviews in several places, so we decided to give them a try.  Great choice!  A funky local place with a good vibe & so much personality!  Their backstory is on the menu & is worth the read.  We were starving & there was a pretty long wait, so we just grabbed 2 seats at the outdoor bar to eat there instead of waiting 45 min. for a table.  Our servers couldn't have been nicer (or cuter, says the husband), and sitting at the bar gave us a chance to visit with them more than if we had been at a table.  Plus, we got to watch old reruns on grainy black & white TV's while we listened to old rat-pack music.  Loved that!\n\nThe menu was huge, but we settled on the Aunt Margherita Pizza, add pepperoni.  Not very adventurous, I know, but we were starving & didn't want to chance any bad surprises.  A stuffed or pan pizza would have been more fun but, again, STARVING & didn't want to wait.  Did I mention we were starving??  Anyway, our pizza came out on a super thin, crispy crust and oh-so-yummy.  Although it did seem a little bit dry, so we asked for more sauce; but other than that, delicious.  And not too bread-y, like some pizza can be. \n\nWhile we were waiting for our food to come out, they came around with samples of another thin crust pizza, Lawrence's Original, I think it was.  There was much more going on with that than the one we ordered.  Lawrence's is the one we'll order next time.  Either that or not arrive so hungry, so we can stand the wait for a stuffed or pan pizza 'cause they looked AWESOME!  (Also, note to self: carnivores should not take menu suggestions from vegetarian servers.)  Wish we had room for a pizzookie for dessert.  Next time..... (and there WILL be a next time).\n\nI think Oregano's would be a better experience with a bigger group -- even just a party of 4 or more.  That way you could try a few different things & work your way thru their extensive menu.

Very smart. \n\nI\'ve never had a bad meal here, and I\'ve gone A LOT. Something that can only be conveyed in ALL CAPS. :) The portions are big, especially if you order their big salad size. I\'m partial to the "Pablo Picasso" salad. For a little over $10, you get a sizable portion that is hard to finish in one sitting. The "Oregano\'s Favorite" and "Vino Bambino" are delicious, and with so many choices, you can satisfy your tastebuds , almost as much as with a pizza, but with something not known for being characteristically satiating.\n\nI would be remiss to not mention the pizza. I\'ve had their thin crust, and I have had their deep dish Chicago Style, and they are all excellent. You can expect this excellence each time you visit.

We stopped in for lunch last week and they promptly seated us and right in front of a fan to cool us off. I was praying that I put on my deodorant and smelled ok because I didn't want my so-called-stink to be flying all over the patio area. \n\nService was fantastic-most of the server seem to be students and are so enthusiastic, you would kind of want to slap them if they weren't so nice. \n\nI never knew they had lunch specials such as pizza slices, pasta and salad so I went with a slice of pizza but before that there was thing I had to have, \n\nBoom Dip. \n\nIt's a spinach and artichoke dip so delicious and cheesy they if I try really hard, I can taste it.

It has a solid offering of well-crafted Italian dishes, from bruschetta to ziti.\n\nYet, when I visit Oregano's, it is inevitably for a helping of their thin crust pizza. It starts with a light, crispy crust that's cooked to perfection. The sauce has an excellent taste. I like to add a side order so I can top off my slices with a little extra. The cheese and toppings are fresh and flavorful. I recommend the pepperoncini's for spice, along with a savory topping to balance out the meal. The wheat crust option is also nice for a subtle change.\n\nA recent sweet discovery, which was thankfully recommended by a server, is the pizza cookie. This massive 6-inch diameter cookie is served in the deep dish pizza pan in which it is baked. It comes in chocolate chip and white-chocolate macadamia flavors (or best yet, half and half). This dessert is a must-have, regardless of what you order, so be sure to save room and share it with your guests. The pizza cookie makes me not want to eat dessert anywhere else.\n\nThis location is close to the university and packed on a regular basis, which can lead to long wait times towards the later evening hours. I have heard others recommend alternative nearby locations, which are supposedly less crowded.\n\nLastly, I'll relate a story from one of my first visits to Oregano's. In brief, we ordered a pizza and started to wonder what was going on after about 90 minutes of waiting. Shortly after and without any word from us, the owner/manager arrived with our pizza, apologized for the delay, and removed the full cost from our bill. This event demonstrated Oregano's willingness to take accountability for its service, which is all too rare. \n\nOregano's is a place that you must visit at least once. I suspect that anyone who visits once will return many more times.", 'business_id': '8Hn5X1AqgmSLHRG2KgBJBg', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2011-10-04', 'type': 'review'}

It\'s a short drive to Sky Harbor Airport, so I normally stop in after my flight arrives.  We had a group of 10 people on a Friday night.  We arrived at 6pm to avoid a long wait.  After 20 minutes, we were seated on the outdoor patio.\n\nThey have a few TVs and a bar area that keep you occupied while you wait.  The baseball playoffs were on, and the local team (Arizona Diamondbacks) were playing Milwaukee in a decisive game five to advance to the next round of the playoffs ... unfortunately, all the TVs were playing black and white reruns of "The Honeymooners" show from the 1950s.  Several other diners were wondering why the game wasn\'t on, but the staff didn\'t get the hint.  The Diamondbacks lost in extra innings.  Go Giants!\n\nWe started with the bruschetta and garlic bread.  They were both good, but the bruschetta was the better choice.  We had four kids in our group.  They wanted more bruschetta, but we still had pizza coming.\n\nThey have a good selection of beers (bottle and draft).  We went with draft since they were still at happy hour prices.\n\nNext, we had a large serving of the Oregano\'s favorite salad.  It was enough for 6 adults.  The salad was crisp, and the honey vinaigrette dressing was sweet.\n\nThe pizza was outstanding!  The kids went with a 16" thin crust.  Half cheese, and half hawaiian.  It was the perfect amount for four.  After the pizza was brought out, they sprinkled fresh cheese on top.  My son is a picky eater, but he loved the thin crust.\n\nWe also ordered a 12" Aunt Shirley\'s Gorgonzola Sausage (with pepperoncinis).  I normally prefer pepperoni or sausage, but the combination of the gorgonzola cheese and pepperoncinis was excellent.  The 12" was just right for four adults.\n\nTwo of my friends didn\'t feel like pizza, so they went with pasta.  They ordered the El Diablo Shrimp pasta, and the garlic chicken lasagna.  The servings are huge ... probably double the size of a normal serving.  I would have asked them how the pasta was, but since they both finished their plates, I\'m guessing it was good.  Again, these are HUGE servings.\n\nThis was my first time eating here with kids, so we had to try the pizza cookie for dessert.  Incredible.  Why didn\'t I order this before :)\n\nThe food was great, but the customer service was even better.  Our server (Melanie) was outstanding.  We never had to ask for anything because she was always one step ahead of us.\n\nThe bill including two rounds of drinks and tip was $200.  Great dinner at Oregano\'s.

First of all, arriving between the times of 430-6ish means you will be arriving near the time where there is limited parking space. I\'m not sure how many people Oregano\'s seats, but it\'s 3x the amount of parking spots available. \n\nSecondly, the wait time can be killer. They do not accept reservations so you can easily wait up to 45 minutes during a non-weekend dinner rush. It\'s up to you to bring a powerbar or a TIME magazine, luckily I live 1 block away so I can come by, write my name down and go back home to watch LEBRON JAMES manhandle Paul Pierce. Or you can wait around and hope they bring you out pizza samples while you wait, which they commonly do.\n\nI did take my dad to this restaurant for his birthday. When we were all seated...my mom changed her mind and decided she did not like her seat...."uhhh, excuse me waitress, my mom really doesn\'t like this seat...can we please move?" Even though it was busy and crowded, no hesitancy, we got moved immediately. Definitely some solid service points with the staff. Despite the wait, the customer service here is impeccable, makes the wait time extremely tolerable.\n\nSo we built our own Stuffed Crust 12 inch pizza with mushrooms, chicken and jalapenos....which takes 45 minutes to make. 45 MINUTES! So, yeah that sounds like a long time and it is. But good food is not fast food, do not forget this. While we waited we ordered the large Big Beefstroni Salad, which came anchored down with a mix of shaved rib-eye, jalapenos, white cheese, tomatoes, spinach, Romaine lettuce and crispy sauteed sweet onions on top. And it comes with some bomb dressing (not ranch). Definitely enough to feed 3-4 people. Once we finished that up, our pizza was knocking down our stomachs. This was a massively deep pizza with cheese and sauce and toppings for days. The menus says that it\'s big enough to feed 4-6 people. Sometimes when I read that, I think to myself that\'s a lie. But not this time my hungry friends. 4-6 people actually means 4-6 people. \n\nOregano\'s, you have great dinners but you make me feel like a wood-legged pirate running a marathon...it takes me so long to finish with you, but alas your food is good and the amount of homeless people surrounding your establishment is amazingly 0....which is difficult to accomplish when you are so near to Mill Ave. So for this I thank you.\n\nI do wish parking was better, I do wish that there was more variety on your menu and I do wish that your seating was more comfortable. I\'m 6 ft 3 and when I sit in one of your booths, the table is nearly on level with my head.

The food is amazing, it is a great place to eat right by ASU, and normally I have never had a problem. I take everyone here who comes to visit out of town, and every year I celebrate my birthday here. It has been a tradition for almost 10 years. \n\nLast week I celebrated another one my birthday with 14 of my friends. I know they don\'t take reservations so I called the day of at 10am and let them know to expect us at 7pm and reiterated how I celebrate my birthday here every year and how impressed I am with their service. The guy on the other end thanked me for my kind words and told me to here there at 6:30 so they could seat us, he even said that if not all 14 people were there it would not be a problem (just like all the years before), as long as the majority of my party was there. \n\nAt 6:30 I arrived as usual and the nightmare began. It took 2 hours for us to get seated, you would think is was a weekend and not a Tuesday night. They refused to seat me because we had 12 not 14 people even after I explained to the hostess what the guy told me this morning she was rude and just told me it would be another 50 min. After an hour and a half I told my party to forget it and walk across the street and eat elsewhere. They must have overheard because as we began to leave the hostess came out with appetizers. So we sat back down. \n\nI then went up to the hostess to thank her for the appetizers when another male worker who was standing there with her retorted "ya well I was tired of you complaining". Umm excuse me 1) what poor customer service 2) you had hours in advance it\'s not like I showed up out if the blue and wanted to be seated and 3) we had 14 people can you say TIPS? what is the deal\n\nAfter his comment I just walked away it was ridiculous and if that was the only rude thing he said I would not be writing this. As we were being seated the other 2 people showed up. I walked up to the the hostess stand to direct my friends over to the table and told the hostess that now we were at 14 and of course that stupid punk kid had to pop off the mouth with another comment saying "ya until the next 30 people come". Oh I was livid. Who says stuff like that? \n\nThe rest of the night went smoothly and as we left I again thank the hostess but never received an apology for the rude boy. I will never come back to this location again. I will spend the extra 10 min and drive to the location on Dobson than come back again.

Again, simple, but tasty.  The salami, peppercini pepper, and parmesan cheese on the salad was very light and not over powering with dressing like most places.  The pizza I ordered thin crust and yes the crust was perfectly toasted and not soggy as I would expect with all the meat ingredients atop.

By the time we had food served, it was over 2 in a half hours later. This place does not have a reputation of a pizzeria bianco. \n\nProblem #1 - We waited over an hour to get seated for a large party once everyone got here (which we were ok with, that's why we stuck around). Then when they actually seated us, our parties didn't even get to sit together. \n\nProblem #2 - not everyone fit in the booth after waiting for so long. \n\nProblem #3 - we waited to get the food over an hour. No one came to apologize or tell us why it was taking so long until we requested a manager. We sat down at 805, ordered by 815. Food came out at 930. Wings, pasta, sandwiches, and thin crust pizza shouldn't take over an hour. They told us the deep dish took 30-40min. \n\nProblem #4 - we asked to speak to a manager. All she did was give me the run around and lied and bs everything. She told me food here takes an hour, especially deep dish (its written in the menu as a story - who the hell reads that shit). That's a lie, if the order went in at 850 like she said, how did we get our food earlier at 930, we should have gotten it at 950. And our order should have went in at 815. Other parties that sat 30 min later got their pastas and salads well before us. I didn't think an appetizer would take that long. She explained that they cook the pizza first then make wings, sandwiches so they are ready the same time. When I had gotten my wings, they were cold, dried, and overcook. The manager shouldn't even be running the place if she can't even service the people. They asked if we want new wings, we don't want to wait another hour for that!\n\nProblem #5 - manager said she would comp the pizza cookies, we got charged for all that and had to complain again about the wings. The manager had to come back and talk to us again and she finally apologized (which should have been done). I don't complain unless it's reasonable enough to complain. She just didn't handle it properly the first time around. No one really ate their food. I'm sure it would have been good if food was hot and ready to eat instead of cold after waiting over an hour, then being lied to.\n\nA week later, we took our birthday friend to The Parlor to make up for the poor Oregano's experience and it was 10x better!", 'business_id': '8Hn5X1AqgmSLHRG2KgBJBg', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2014-03-13', 'type': 'review'}

Mind you with the 5 of us I said why can't we just be seated and last person can just squeeze in cuz there's room. Nope EVERYONE has to be there. 10 minutes after they seat those 2 people, 2 more people join them. So clearly you LIE to get seating here.

This was my first time here, I was meeting a few of my friends who attend ASU for dinner. Now being from a world that custimer service is pretty much everything I have to be honest and say that from the gate the service was lacking in every aspect. Let\'s start with the snotty, young hostess who THOUGHT she was being sly (by talking under her breathe and not looking directly at us but rather above our heads), about talking about our group and how (because one extra person showed up) "messed up everything" (her exact words). She continud to talk negatively about us and more so insult us by thinking we were deaf, maybe, because in her head I believe she didn\'t think we could hear her even though we were literally 4 feet from her. SMH! About 15 minutes later we were seated. Approximately 5 minutes later we were finally greeted and our drink order was taken, drinks dropped off....then almost 10 minutes later our server comes back and finally takes our order only to inform us that it\'s going to be about 25 minutes for our meal to come out. Now I guess it could take 25 minutes to make 4 pasta dishes, cheese bread and a sausage but that kinda seems long. Nonetheless, our food comes out but one entree short. The server then says it got messed up in the kitchen and it was going to be another 8 minutes. She then comes back and apologizes and says the manager is working on the dish and it will be out soon, about 10 min later the entree finally comes out....I\'m going to cut this short as I sure you already get the picture. The experience of our dinner here simply for lack of better words, sucked. \nOnly reason I gave them two stars was because however horrible the service was the food itself was pretty good. Portions were large and can definitely be shared. Pretty sure I won\'t be coming back to this restaurant again, or maybe we will just visit another location with hostesses that don\'t start out the dining experience so negatively.', 'business_id': '8Hn5X1AqgmSLHRG2KgBJBg', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2015-04-02', 'type': 'review'}

That took forever to come out. When our server brought it out, we ordered a family style salad to start, and two big rig pastas with a side of italian sausage. Literally, no more than two minutes later, our salad and pasta came out at the same time. I thought to myself, I'm sorry but there is no way that pasta could have cooked that quickly. Much to my intuition, the pasta tasted like it had just been sitting there waiting to get brought to a table. The sauce was watery and flavorless. I had about three noodles and said forget it. We sent back the salad because there was no point to even eat it anymore.\n\nOf course we ended with the pizooki, but how can you really mess up cookie and ice cream?

My boyfriend and I LOVE this place and have only been disappointed with their food once.\n\nI usually have OK service (have never had great customer service here) but the last time I visited I was sooooo disappointed. \n\nWe only get a 30min lunch break at my job, so we are always looking for places that will allow us to order take-out. Two weeks ago it was my friend\'s last day, and we wanted to go out to lunch as a group to wish her well and to spend time away from the office for lunch. My co-worker called this location a couple hours before we planned to eat to see if we could place our order ahead of time, but eat there and order drinks with a server. (We obviously planned to tip the server for our food purchase as well) Even though the girl said that would be fine over the phone, it was a nightmare when we got there. \n\nWe were scolded by some blonde woman (I\'m assuming a manager?) because they "don\'t normally do this", even though we were ok\'d by the girl who took our orders over the phone. Everyone treated us terribly as if we were being high maintenance, even though we were advised by the staff that this would be ok. We were not trying to make trouble for anyone, and were treated poorly because of the new girl\'s mistake. Not to mention she tried to close us out ahead of time, even though the bartender advised her that she should not "close us out"; to which she said "I\'m not closing them out, I\'m having them pay for it." (Clearly she was brand new to the industry).\n\n5 stars for food but the service at this location is terribleeeee! Such a shame.', 'business_id': '8Hn5X1AqgmSLHRG2KgBJBg', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2015-10-27', 'type': 'review'}
