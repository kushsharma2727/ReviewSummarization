Although line was super long, service was very quick from start to finish. Best part, the burger! Very close but slightly behind I-N-O in quality with more of a home burger taste. \n\nCons: No Milkshakes! How can you sell hamburgers with no milkshakes? Fries were the typical heavy, greasy, peanut oil tasting Five Guys fries. Not a fan of Five Guys fries. No outdoor dinning. \nOne man bathrooms are not conducive to 100+ diners at one time. Mushrooms are canned so no real mushroom flavor.\n\nOverall great burger but In-N-Out still holds the best rating overall for food, quality and experience.

I thought to myself. "For reals?" No way. \n\nLet\'s get down to business. I got myself a bacon cheeseburger, regular fries, and a drink. $11 bucks. I thought it was pretty pricey, especially when I could drive a little bit and grab myself a double double animal style, fries, and a drink for 6 bucks at IN-n-OUt. \n\nThe order came out in a paper bag and you could see the grease spots all over it. Yum. I opened the paper bag only to find a mountain of fries just piled inside. The burger was what I was most looking forward to. I opened the aluminum wrapper like it was a Christmas present, carefully and slowly, to see the steam of the fresh hand packed, juicy, double bacon cheese burger staring right back at me and begging for mercy as I was about to double fist the burger into my salivating mouth. One bite was all it took. The endorphins were rushing through my brain and all that I uttered under my breath was... O-m-g. \n\nThe fries though, left much to be desired. Hence, the one star deduction. It wasn\'t all that they were cracked up to be. It was a bit bland and soggy. There is really nothing worse than taking a bite of a juicy burger only to bite into a soggy fry right afterwards. It ruins the experience.  I don\'t care that much for soggy fries, it was truly a let down. \n\nOverall, minus 1 for the fries, plus 5 for the burger. Oh and the peanuts you can eat while waiting. Five guys is going to be a success in Vegas. I can\'t wait to see them grow and go back again for their delectable burger.', 'business_id': 'Jlcx_J7DAqXthtsb_OMBEw', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2011-03-03', 'type': 'review'}

HEAVEN.\n\nPros: Five Guys had -one thing I liked: The cajun seasoning for the fries. Mainly hot paprika, and salt, but it was a very enjoyable flavor. It all went downhill from there, sadly.\n\nCons: A -greasy- burger, no matter how much the propaganga on the walls tells you otherwise. (the little reviews/write-up from mags, all along the walls. The one i\'m referring to it the article nearest the bathroom.) The meat has very little flavor. The "juiciness" they brag about was just oozy grease, so be warned! The toppings I chose: grilled onions, sauteed mushrooms, lettuce, pickles and mustard. I ordered the bacon cheseburger, for those of you curious. The mushrooms? They use -canned- button mushrooms; those godawful slimy, discusting things with little flavor but of what I like to think of as ASS. A BIIIGGG thumbs-down for using such a gross item; it took away from any potential tastiness of the burger, and I ended picking them all off, after 2 bites.\n\nThe fries: Wow. TOTAL let-down, but for the seasoning. They were soggy, limpy, greasy, PARTIALLY UNCOOKED, and the worst french fries i\'ve EVER had in my life. They also cook them in peanut oil, so they have a unique \'tang\' to them that I did not care for in the least.\n\nIn-N-Out has NOTHING to worry about, this place isn\'t even -close- to being a contender for a good burger joint!', 'business_id': 'Jlcx_J7DAqXthtsb_OMBEw', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2011-03-03', 'type': 'review'}

I prefer a bigger meatier burger with mushrooms and bacon but everyone has their own personal preferences. \n\nThe fries both here and at In-n-out dont\' compare to the industrially-engineered unnatural (yet perfect) fries at Mcdonald\'s, but they are both natural fries and that\'s the way it is. They aren\'t great, the fries at in-n-out aren\'t great. I dont really eat many french fries so I don\'t care. \n\nMy burger was perfection (I actually LOVE canned mushrooms so I\'m so pumped they give me these included in the price), and the bacon and cheese and meat was all delicious. As an added plus, they have 100% beef Hebrew National hotdogs. You can get cheese melted on them too, or cheese and bacon. I split a yummy cheesy hot dog with my husband in lieu of fries ! \n\nSo I\'m taking a star off because I used their online ordering system so I could skip the lines. I pulled up to the extremely crowded, busy restaurant (they had 17 people working in the kitchen so they definitely weren\'t understaffed!), and told the order guy "I\'m Blair, I have a web order, do you know how I pick that up". He gave me a clueless look then asked the manager. She fiddled around a bit and then said "uh yeah, it\'s being made". Ok, fair enough. The problem is even though i told him my name and that I ordered online, they only call the orders out by number. After he called "43" a whopping 5x, I asked him "any chance that\'s for me". He shrugged and handed me the bag- sure enough it said "WEB ORDER - BLAIR" in huge letters on top. Hey clown, when I tell you "I\'m blair, waiting for a web order" maybe don\'t call it out by  number??!?!? How are web orders supposed to know we are order "43"??? Call web orders out by name, idiot!\n\nAnyways, despite my little web pick up mishap, the food was delicious and wonderful and I will be returning many times.

I've dined at a Midwest Five Guys location, and I didn't think it was very good. So yeah, I was a little nervous.\n\nBut that nervousness quickly grew to anticipation as we approached the location and began the search for parking. Once finally entering, the anticipation became a desperate hunger. Despite the line being quite long, it moved relatively quickly. It was around 20 minutes from the time we got in the line until the time we received our order.\n\nA huge smile came over my face as that paper bag with grease spots coming through was set in front of me. As I unwrapped my burger, I couldn't help but stop and stare. It was a thing of beauty. Awww, Five Guys, we meet again. I took a big bite and relished in child-like joy as juicy goodness started to run down my hands. The two patties, the cheese, the bacon, the crisp lettuce and tomato - so fab! And then I dived into the Cajun fries. Crispy outside, soft inside, and covered in a spicy mix that is such savory deliciousness. Yes, it was just as good as I remembered from in DC. Yes, it did totally hold up to the DC area locations. Yes, yes, yes. \n\nMy personal note on the fries: You have to go with the Cajun fries.

(yes, they are free. some people looked at me funny when i just grabbed a little box of them. when i told them it was free and to get some they were all for it though.) i know it is busy and a pretty hyped place right now, but wait in line. it's worth it.\nso glad they have arrived in las vegas and just like nyc, it will be a weekly place for me and my burger loving mouth.", 'business_id': 'Jlcx_J7DAqXthtsb_OMBEw', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2011-03-13', 'type': 'review'}

I brought my Mom with me as she is a burger connoisseur. Well, not really, she just likes burgers. We arrived at about 11:30 AM and the place was slammed. Lots of police officers (oh and by the way, when we left a fire truck pulled up and firefighters piled out to go inside. Damn, missed \'em!)\n\nSo I was really expecting this place to knock my socks off and it didn\'t really. It reminds me of an Inn N Out, except the staff act like they\'re all on speed, yelling and there\'s just a lot of commotion going on behind the counter. I guess it was kind of interesting to watch them work, but the longer I sat there, the more I thought, "well this must get old quick."\n\nAnyway, the service was good even with all the commotion. My mother and I both ordered Cheeseburgers, okay here comes my big complaint: I did not know that ordering a Cheeseburger would mean I get TWO PATTIES. Why doesn\'t it say that on their menu? I was confused by the "Cheeseburger" and "Little Cheeseburger" on the menu. I just assumed the little cheeseburger was perhaps a bit smaller than the normal one. But no - my mother and I get surprised with double patties of meat. I like my meat just as much as anyone else, but I really do not like double burgers. Really wish I had known this.\n\nOkay, so minus the fact we were tricked into double burgers - the cheeseburger itself was juicy - plus! I decided to go all out and get mine "All The Way", lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, pickles, mayo, ketchup, and mustard. My mom went more conservative - lettuce, tomato, mustard, and pickles. I kinda wish I\'d gone more conservative, but that\'s my own fault. The burger itself WAS GOOD. I will go out and say I liked it better than Smashburger. However, I think it was about on-par with Inn N Out.\n\nAs for the fries, I am not a "natural cut" french fries fan. My favorite fries come from Inn N Out. So, I guess it\'s more of a personal preference. I\'m not saying they were bad, but they are just not my cup of tea.\n\nI think I would go back here so I could try one of their hot dogs, but I\'d skip the fries, AND I would definitely order the LITTLE Cheeseburger. So, with all the hype, this place only gets 3 stars from me. Perhaps I\'m just more attuned to a West Coast style burger joint. I do know that 5 Guys originated on the East Coast. It makes me wonder if this location in Las Vegas is lacking what they may bring to the table out on the East Coast?

We cruised in and checked out the menu, I like that you can add any or all toppings and the burger stays the same price, but for a guy like me who doesn\'t like all the BS that a lot of people put on a burger, it\'s all about the meet, bun and cheese for me, the rest is wasted stomach space. I ordered a Bacon cheeseburger with grilled onions and ketchup and he ordered a burger with everything on it and we both got regular fries. Service was fast, cashier was friendly and she handed us our cups. 4 or 5 minutes later after snacking on some peanuts I walked up to our bag o burgers and thought  "wow this bag is kinda heavy." So, I looked inside and all I could see was fries. WOW, that\'s a ton of potato!!!\n\nAfter we ripped up the bag so we could get to the fries, we each ate about 2 potatoes worth of fryness and finally could get to the burgers. Honestly, this kind of annoyed me personally. I\'m more of a burger guy than a fry guy so I wanted to get my hands on that and couldn\'t because of all the fries. But, in their defense they were in fact  pretty good so it wasn\'t a big deal. Next time I might not even get fries, depends how empty my stomach is.\n\nI folded open the foil and thought WOW again. This thing is pretty big and awesome looking, hoping the flavor didn\'t disappoint because the site I was looking at was impressive. The thing was huge, 2 patties with bacon, cheese and onions just falling out of the sides. Greasy deliciousness staring back at me. I picked the thing up and took my first bite and it didn\'t disappoint, the crisp of bacon, thickness of the patty, the gooey cheese, and the crunchiness of the onion was a great blend for me. An excellent burger! We decided that it was one of the greasier burgers we\'d ever seen and devoured, but was definitely delicious and well worth it as hungry as we were. I commented how I needed to go run a few miles after inhaling all of those calories and my buddy said "run a couple for me" HAHA\n\nAll-in-all a pretty good experience, food was above average, price was a little bit high but maybe they justify that because they give you about 2 pounds of fries for the regular size.', 'business_id': 'Jlcx_J7DAqXthtsb_OMBEw', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2011-04-25', 'type': 'review'}

I hear great things about this place from reliable sources but I was underwhelmed with my burger.  Don't get me wrong - it was a decent burger and the bacon was, I dare say, delicious.  But it's bacon.  \nThink the issue with Five Guys is twofold:\n1) They seriously need to put SALT on the patties.  Yeah whoever the five guys are....season your food.  Like In-n-Out does.  In-n-Out even has a sign you can see from drive thrus reminding their cooks to season the patty correctly.  Clearly no such reminder at Five Guys.  I've eaten at two locations in two states and this is a trend.  A bad one.\n2) I'm all for picking your own toppings - I guess.  But how's about a burger you can just order off the menu?  Because, honestly, the first time I go to a place I usually ask for the most popular or recommended item.  Makes sense right?  You go in there and what do you do?  Order the burger with everything?  Just what you like?  Is this really a decision you can take time to make with 20 people behind you in line and you not wanting to be like the idiot in front of you who, LITERALLY, took 3 minutes 26 seconds to order his burger with 20 people behind him.  I timed it cause my uncanny douche bag spider sense tingled and knew it would happen.  \n\nFries were ok.  Next time I'll try the cajun ones.  They need to use smaller fries and hotter oil because it isn't crispy like McDonalds fries. Or double fry them because the fries do not have a crispy exterior.  WTF is with that.\nAlso, not necessary to carbo load so many fries in one order.  I'd rather pay less for less fries and not have to dig through fries to get to my custom ordered hamburger.  But that's a minor complaint.\n\nBut have to say it's way better than Fatburger, BK (obviously), McDonalds (obviously) and a whole host of those little hamburger joints that also serve breakfast.  It's also more expensive than these other places and not sure it's worth it.  \n\nOh yeah...their buns are the definition of mediocre.

Now, before I\'m stoned by In-N-Out\'s rabid following, hear me out.\n\nFive Guys makes a great burger (and cheeseburger, so I hear).  It\'s also a killer deal:  toppings, including grilled onions, sauteed mushrooms, ketchup, mustard, lettuce, pickles, jalapenos, bbq sauce, etc, are all free.  Yes, free.  It\'s almost unbelievable as most burger places in town charge for anything other than your basic tomato, lettuce, and onion.  Here, you can load up or go minimalist.  It\'s your choice.\n\nAlso, the burgers are massive.  Each sesame seed bun (advisory to those with tree nut allergies) is packed with giant, juicy beef patties.  I bit into my hamburger and literally said "holy s*&t, this is delicious."   Everything tasted fresh and every ingredient was in proportion.  It really was hypeworthy. Please note, however, that a regular burger is enormous. So, if you\'re not in the mood to overeat to the point where you want to die (like I did), try the little hamburger that\'s also offered on the menu.\n\nNow, the fries.  We ordered a regular-sized order of Cajun fries and they were...disappointing.  The thickness of the cut made them taste like three-hour-old steak fries.  They lacked crispiness and weren\'t hot, the essentials of a good fry.  So, In-N-Out wins that round.\n\nOverall, I\'d go back to Five Guys in a second.

To me, more does not equate to "better" or even "good."  Two over-cooked and dry burger patties of thin-to-medium thickness served so messy you need to eat the concoction with a fork (the soggy bottom bun made it impossible to pick up. Why it was so soggy when the burger was so dry I don\'t know). It was relatively flavorless and saved only by the grilled onions that are part of the "all the way" version.  The fries are overly greasy and soggy--not sure if they just don\'t let them cook long enough or what, but limp fries are not remotely enjoyable to me. Luckily the serving size is so huge you can share your calorie-laden limpness with a few friends if you so desire. (The fact that they put a couple dozen napkins in the bag to help soak up the grease should have prepared me before I even delved in.)\n\nI can see why people who enjoy fast food might find this appealing; the topping choices alone make it better than your typical fast food joint.

So much so that even the yelling of order numbers is hard to hear. When standing at the counter. Wearing a hearing aid. Right next to the guy yelling.\n\nAs a friend once said in a review - the volume button is usually a big frackin\' knob labeled as such... turn it counter-clockwise... please?\n\n---\n\nOK, I am here to eat. Summary? It\'s fast and it\'s food. Get where I am going with this?\n\nI paid almost $9 for a bacon and cheese hot dog (no bun) and a small order of cajun fries. To drink, I opted for a cup for water (free). On the plus side, the fries are sized to feed 2-3 people, easily. And, for the dog, you can throw on all kinds of toppings for free. So, I do see some value in there.\n\nThe hot dog was tasty if slightly overcooked. I opted for the barbeque sauce, jalapenos, onions, a little mustard and a little relish. Whether you agree with my no-one-is-kissing-me-tonight combo or not, I have to give credit where it\'s due: the toppings were fresh, tasted good, and the vegetable ones were nowhere near canned or otherwise boxed - at least I couldn\'t tell if they were.\n\nMy issue is the presentation (common issue for a protein-style person like me). Every order is packaged to go, whether you ask for it or not. In this case, it was a hot dog sprinkled with some cheese, toss on a couple slices of crispy (also slightly overdone) bacon, the jalapenos and onions I added, and wrap it in aluminum foil. The sauces and relish (i.e. the wet ingredients) were provided in little plastic cups so as not to create a mess. Great idea there. However... no paper boat, no lettuce wrap option, no way to pick it up. I had to get some of the plastic cutlery and cut it into pieces.\n\nUm... again I point out that it was wrapped in tin foil. A hard breeze can rip that stuff... It\'s no match for a dressed hot dog that needs to be chopped up by a serrated plastic knife.\n\nKnife - 1 \nTin foil - 0 \n\nCue the napkins.\n\nHot dog #fail.\n\nMoving on. I don\'t eat fries, but a friend who knows my affinity for spice and bold flavors said I had to try the cajun fries. I had three or four and actually found them to be really tasty, well cooked, and just the right amount of spicy. There was one or two pieces that seemed to be a bit much, but overall they were great. Bonus points, very well done.\n\nThe packaging was disappointing, the place was too loud to hear yourself think, there should be a trash bin near the drink station.\n\nIt\'s not bad, but it\'s not worth the hype. It\'s a solid A-OK, 3 star, burger stand. It\'s decent food fast (paraphrasing someone\'s motto, I know, but it\'s applicable)... and that\'s about it.\n\nBonus "yay" for the free peanuts? *shrug*', 'business_id': 'Jlcx_J7DAqXthtsb_OMBEw', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2011-08-02', 'type': 'review'}

In-N-Out argument, and which one is better, etc.  But the truth is, that\'s like comparing apples to oranges (whether you like apples over oranges, or vice versa, is a different story).  \n\nTo me, it tastes a little more like burgers you get fresh off the grill in your backyard (of course, that could be because they wrap the burgers in foil).  It is more expensive than In-N-Out, but when I order a small hamburger (one patty), fries and drink, it comes out to about $10.  That\'s the same as a burger at Applebee\'s or Red Robin, and believe me, this burger is MUCH better.  I also like that they offer a ton of toppings for "free," i.e., they don\'t charge extra.  This allows me to get a burger with grilled onions, mushrooms and bell peppers (ohhhhh yeah, what\'s your name, who\'s your daddy).\n\nThe regular size fries come in a pretty decent sized cup, which is sharable with *at least* one other person.  (Depending on how much of a fry monster you are.)  Personally, I like the regular seasoned fries, as opposed to the cajun seasoned fries.  \n\nAlso, as other peeps have mentioned, the soda machines are touch screen that give you lots of soda options.  For example, for Diet Coke - there\'s Diet Coke Lime, Diet Coke Cherry, Diet Coke Cherry Vanilla, Diet Coke Orange, etc.  And that\'s just for Diet Coke.  It\'s like that for each type of soda, e.g., Fanta, Coke Sprite, etc.  It\'s awesome! \n\nAs a FYI, this particular location appears to have the A/C on overdrive ALL the time.  It makes it a little uncomfortable to eat there sometimes.  I\'ve been to Five Guys at the Las Vegas outlets and on Flamingo at the 215, and neither seem to have the same issue.  \n\nOverall, I can\'t compare Five Guys to In-N-Out because for me, they\'re just different.

We just had to talk about this place....\n\nSo this is one of the fastest growing fast food chains in the country, and with a cult-like following comparable to In-N-Out, it has been at the top of the list for Best Burger in America.  originally from Virginia, this chain has spread across the country like a brushfire.  Having heard a lot about Five Guys, as soon as it opened in Vegas, we went to try it......\n\nAnd just as a note, we have eaten here three times, all ending in the same result.  Usually I give the benefit of the doubt when it comes to food, it's not always consistent.... but in the case of Five Guys...it is...\n\nFive Guys Burgers and Fries is, like in the title, a burger joint.  They also serve Kosher Hot Dogs, Grilled Cheese and Veggie Sandwiches.  Their only side is French Fries in two styles: Five Guys and Cajun Style. Their normal burger has two patties with the usual suspects, Cheeseburger, Bacon Burger and Bacon Cheeseburger, and if you want only one patty, put, 'Little' in front of the former categories.  They tout that everything is fresh, (meat isn't frozen) and Condiments are free, (there's fifteen of them).... And you'll need ALL of them! The Hamburger buns are eggier and sweeter than most other breads you'll find in other sandwich chains...\n\nSo you walk inside and its covered in Red and White checkered tiles with sacks of peanuts that create a queue to the cash register.  In the Southern tradition, the peanuts are free, and meant to be peeled and shelled onto the floor.....animals......\n\nEverything is made to order so it takes a while, which is the good part.  There are no trays, everything's shoved into a brown paper sack; if you order fries, they just dump a load into the Brown bag even though they're in a cup that should contain them-needless to say, they're over portioned- one order feeds four (obesity in America running alive and well here).\n\nEverything's fried in peanut oil, and to say they are pretty darn good is an understatement, (only get the Cajun Style if you really like them hot...cuz you're gonna burn)....\n\nNow, being that it's primary product is Burgers, you would expect that what you're gonna get is a good, quality burger.  However, this is not the case; each time we tried the Bacon Cheeseburger we couldn't taste the burger component of the sandwich, instead, all we tasted was the condiments... Now to be totally honest, we did have the Burger, 'All The Way' which  means we had every condiment on the Burger, and the condiments itself were spectacular!!! I mean, the Cheese was excellent quality, the pickles were superb, tart and crunchy and the sauces had a tanginess that is hard to find in your run of the mill Fast Food Chain Restaurant.  But I mean, come on!  There was absolutely no taste of burger whatsoever; it was like a condiments burger with filler meat by product! What am I?  Vegetarian?  Is this Seitan? Have I slipped into a parallel Universe where Burgers are Vegan while Whole Foods serves MSG and Nitrates at their salad bars?\n\nAfter the third try, I just about had it!  I was gonna get to the bottom of this mystery-what did the hell did thy do to this poor cow? Why did it have to come to it's untimely death, only to be utterly unenjoyable eat? It was upsetting me\n\nSo I decided to go back and order just a Hamburger, no condiments, no nothing just to see how the burger fared without any bells and whistles.\n\nAnd as I was ordering my, 'nekkid' hamburger, the look on the face of the girl at the counter was of sheer horror,  the utter look of dread as she realized we were about to uncover the secret of Five Guys.\n\nSo when we got our Burger and tried it, our greatest fears were confirmed....  It was the worst quality meat you find; with no condiments there was nothing to mask it's unpleasant flavor.  As you can tell, it's quite lean (and dry as a used Hockey puck) there was a weak hint of unpleasant beef , but only as an undercurrent of something stronger, more rancid (ammonia)?  Pink Slime doesn't hold a candle to this piece of masticated, intestine, collagen, knuckle patty.....\nBut after having four burgers here, I was satisfied that it wasn't just a one time experience, it's consistently a poor product.  I don't know how they've managed to trick the rest of America, but this is not a burger joint, it's a wayward homeless shelter for unusable animal carcass parts.  Needless to say, I'd rather dumpster dive for my next meal than go back to Five Guys..\n\nOh yeah, we also had the Hot Dog......meh.........\n\nRatings (Out of Five Stars)\n\nFood:            0.5  \nAmbience:   1\nService         3  (they're nice people)", 'business_id': 'Jlcx_J7DAqXthtsb_OMBEw', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2012-04-19', 'type': 'review'}

Since I haven\'t ever been there, I thought today would be the best day to try it.\n\nWhen you walk in, you\'re quickly whisked away to a diner-esque type setting, full of reds and whites.  The sack of potatoes line the way to the order counter and boxes of peanuts greet you as you find a table.  The staff is super young but really nice and courteous which is a huge bonus in my book.  \n\nFirst of all, I can\'t say enough great things about their bugers.  It\'s juicy, succulent and really lives up to the saying, "melts in your mouth."  I got the regular bacon cheeseburger, which comes with 2 patties.  I added mayo, lettuce, tomatoes, grilled onions and mushrooms.  I also added the regular Five Guys style fries and a drink.  The burger was HUGE and sooooooo delicious!  The fries were thick hand cut fries.  Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside...just the way I like it.  BTW, the regular fries feeds two people.  I can eat a lot and had to share LOL.  My ONLY rant is that I don\'t think paying $15 for my meal at Five Guys or anywhere else for that matter is practical for one sitting, so I wouldn\'t be indulging here every week, but nice to have once in a while.\n\nIf you\'re a fan of In N Out, trust me, you\'ll LOVE Five Guys.

I honestly enjoy them all, but when I want a juicy, filling burger I go straight to Five Guys. I love that all of their toppings are free, but I always get...brace yourself...pickles, mushrooms, and ketchup. It sounds weird, but it is perfect for me (and no I am not pregnant). I also enjoy that their burgers are doubles! It is just the right amount of food. My husband and I always split a regular fry, which is more than enough. They fill a small cup and then cover your burgers in fries, it is awesome! They have East Coast style fries that you can tell are cut from fresh potatoes, they even have a sign stating where the potatoes are from on any particular day. I love that they even have vinegar for your fries for us East Coasters. The free peanuts while you wait, because everything is made to order, are a nice touch as well.

Though there were many things that really make only slightly convinced I might go back. Notice, I said might. \n\nSo walking in the place you are in a stark white with red checkered wanting-to-be burger joint. Sorry, too clean and calculated to be a real greasy spoon, but they REALLY thought they were trying. There are bags of peanuts that I\'m supposing you are supposed to take, but I didn\'t get why I wanted peanuts when I came in for a burger. I go to the counter and am greeted by a WAY too friendly cashier who screams, "Hi, have you been here before?" My biggest pet peeve is being given some stupid speech just because I haven\'t visited an establishment, so I lied. I mean seriously, you serve burgers, hot dogs, and fries. What kind of mouth breathing moron can\'t figure out how to order. And when I ordered fries, he asked if I wanted regular (with description of plain with salt...duh) or Cajun. I cut him off as he tried to explain "cajun" as (1) I grew up in the South. Please, I know what "cajun" means and (2) I would probably be insulted by the fake "cajun" anyhow so I didn\'t want to hear it. \n\nAfter I place my order I go sit down to wait. There are only 2 other tables waiting for their food who were before me. As the guys behind the counter cook there is this circus act of screaming and banging still trying to make it seem "energetic" and "authentic." I found it more stupid and annoying. I also have to note that it was cold than the dang arctic in there. I finally got my food and tucked in to enjoy. \n\nLittle Cheeseburger - Good, but nothing so great that I would go crazy for it. It will satiate my cravings for awhile so that\'s good. As for "best" I didn\'t really get it. I think Amreica\'s palette is so destroyed by McDonald\'s and Applebee\'s that the idea of actual good food is lost. It seems like anything mediocre will excite the masses.\n\nFries - I got the regular fries regular sized. Good god almighty the portion was WAY overboard. He had even said that they serve two. Two what? Ogres? I felt bad throwing that much food away, especially since they don\'t compost =(\n\nWhile I was eating I was asked 3 times if I needed anything or wanted a bag to take peanuts home. Um, once was nice, two was ok, and three was getting on my nerves. There is a point where being helpful turns to being annoying. Oh, and after roughly 700 calories in burger and fries, WHY WOULD I NEED TO TAKE PEANUTS? \n\nAll in all I wasn\'t totally turned off, but I won\'t be running back. I\'ll keep up my search and hopefully find some place more local that doesn\'t make me want to punch the staff. I guess if you are into fast food then this is a nice change, but really, they just proved why I hate chains.', 'business_id': 'Jlcx_J7DAqXthtsb_OMBEw', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2012-06-10', 'type': 'review'}

Before Five Guys arrived in Vegas, the folks off the "wrong coast" would show up in town, insult our beloved In n\' Out, and say we didn\'t know a great burger because we\'d never had Five Guys.\n\nWell now that Five Guys is in town, it\'s Game On.  And the outcome in the question of who serves up a better burger?  I\'d love to deliver a definitive winner, but I\'m calling it a tie.\n\nThere\'s no doubt that Five Guys serves up a delicious burger--a greasy, thick, delicious burger.  The ground beef they use makes one of the best, if not the best, burger patty in fast food.  It\'s a thicker patty than In n\' Out and juicier.  Take a bite and a mixture of grease and cooked meat juice will run down your fingers.  Favorite toppings?  Five Guys probably has them and will load up your burger with most toppings without an extra charge (grilled onions, jalapenos, mushrooms, etc.)  Pretty impressive for a fast food chain.\n\nIf there\'s anything that gives an edge to Five Guys, it\'s the fries.  If you get the fries with "cajun seasoning," they come out tossed in delicious Old Bay seasoning -- think spicy and peppery without lighting your tongue on fire.  Old Bay is a rarity in Las Vegas and I\'ll head here just to get those fries.\n\nBottom line: As Samuel L. Jackson would say "Mmmmmm . . . This IS a tasty burger!"

Everythjing in blinding red and white colors.\n  Um ok... So we ordered. We liked how the toppings were free and that they had ones we actually liked. \nThe order was for three: One bacon burger got a 10 out of a 10 rating and some love. The other two, a 5 out of 10. To me ( Yeah I was a 5..) it was just a good greasy burger. I expected much more, something to give it a wow factor. There needed to be a  "You couldn\'t make this at home if you tried" factor... but there was none.\n The fries were just cut friend potato with some salt . ( Again nothing you can\'t make at home). No one liked the fries especially. They were passable but nothing to go on about and the large is about 5 bucks, it will feed a lot of people but who needs that many fries??!

There is a huge stockpile of salted peanuts in industrial size bags near the doorway and you can munch on them while your order is being prepared and some patrons were actually taking some togo after their meal. Too bad you can\'t drop the shells on the floor like back in the good old days, like some restaurants used to allow. Yes the place is very noisy and the background music just adds to the noise level, you can\'t even hear what song is playing. The girl back there putting the burgers together is yelling out something like "GOT IT" every few seconds and it\'s annoying to say the least. Diner talk I guess, but not very pleasant to listen to. The decor is red and white as stated below, but no big deal it\'s like a 50s diner and didn\'t bother me. Around the corner is the multi flavor soda machine and it\'s the latest in technology, I"ve heard about them, but never seen one in real life. You pick a soda by pressing the screen, say "Coca Cola", then a few more buttons show up on the screen and you can choose Vanilla coke or others as a option. The drinks can go into such things like Powerade and you can choose your flavor, orange, grape...Very cool! The only bad thing is there are only 2 dispensers and if it\'s busy or there are kids there before you, you will probably have to wait a while before they are done "playing" with the buttons and different flavors.\nLast but not least is the burgers and fries. As stated before a Burger is double meat patties, the LITTLE burger is a single patty. The LITTLE is plenty enough for the average eater, the double is a belly bomber for sure and it will stick to your ribs. If you get a burger with everything, it\'s is basically flavor overload and you don\'t know what you are eating, but enjoyable never the less. Burgers are fresh and cooked perfectly, but nothing truly exceptional. The fries are medium/thick and as the chalkboard stated came from Washington state that day. The REGULAR order of fries is enough for 2 or 3 people, the large is most likely plenty for a good size family. Our fries were good, but a little bit soggy and could have been cooked at a little higher temperature. Still way better than those teeny tiny itty bitty shoestring fries most places like to serve. The price wasn\'t out of line for what you get, as reviewed by others here and if you can take home a sack of peanuts for munching on while watching TV it\'s quite the bargain. The peanuts are actually VERY tasty and the large bags state they are made especially for Five Brothers. You can\'t eat burgers everyday, but this place is pretty good when you want a classic tasty All American Hamburger.', 'business_id': 'Jlcx_J7DAqXthtsb_OMBEw', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2012-10-04', 'type': 'review'}

South Eastern has quite a selection of food establishments, but Five Guys caught our eye. We'd heard good things about the joint.\n\nWe pulled up, and the smell wafting through the air confirmed that our decision to eat here was spot on.\n\nThe girl behind the counter was very pleasant, asking us if we'd ever been there before, though she probably guess we had not, due to our staring doe-eyed at the menu, then to the peanuts scattered on top of sacks, then back to the menu. \n\nThe menu is pretty simple-she explained that there are either single burgers or double burgers, and regular or cajun fries. We ordered burgers with a variety of items that you can add. I was happy that they offered every type of thing to add to your burger because husband was craving spicy, son was craving pickles, daughter wanted something BBQ. After ordering our burgers customized just for us, and regular AND cajun fries (we just couldnt decide!) we were given our order #, drink cups, and shelled peanuts. \n\nThe drink fountain is amazing. Seriously. Having never seen one of these machines before, we were that family that hogged both machines for quite some time, trying to decide if we wanted flavored juice, coke, sprite, or water. With over 100 different drink flavors, it takes a bit to decide, folks. Our apologies to the customers who were behind us, waiting ever so patiently =)\n\nOur food was served quickly. Burgers tasted fresh and flavorful, fries both cajun and regular were tasty, even with the Malt Vinegar that I used to dip some of my fries in. Daughter was happy to use crayons and index cards to decorate and then pin up on a board specifically for patrons-turned-artists. \n\nWhile eating, I looked around and noticed the decor. There really wasn't much to the place. Simple red and white tiles. I noticed that the burgers were wrapped in foil, and most packaging did not have logos. Less advertising and branding, let the food speak for itself. It works.\n\nTwice, an employee came and greeted our table. One girl offered to take our trash off our table for us, and we declined politely as we felt she didn't need to do that for us, and then what looked like a Manager came and asked how everything was going. \n\n...it is now 8:55am and I am now craving a juicy Five Guys burger and cajun fries... off to see what time they open.", 'business_id': 'Jlcx_J7DAqXthtsb_OMBEw', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2013-05-31', 'type': 'review'}

It has been a while since I\'ve eaten here since my previous experience (over a year ago) didn\'t yield any lasting memories.  I walked in at around 6pm on a Sunday evening.  The restaurant was clean and I approached the counter.  This place has a limited menu with burgers, hot dogs and fries along with their varieties.  I ordered a cheeseburger "all the way" and a hot dog with cheese and onions and a medium order of fries.  The cashier informed me that they "ran out of" hot dog buns and if I would mind my hot dog served on a hamburger bun.  I found that a bit odd that a place where hot dogs are one of two menu items that they would run out of buns, but I went ahead and ordered the altered dog.\n\nWhen I received my order, I dove in to my burger.  Unfortunately, the bottom bun was soggy due to the grease from the burger.  This certainly makes the entire meal a bit unappetizing.  Aside from that, the burger was ok - nothing special but certainly not bad.  The soggy bun really turned me off.  The hot dog was sliced in half and arranged in a hamburger bun.  The dog was Hebrew National and, as expected, was tasty; however, the hamburger bun did not do it justice.  Lastly, the fries, while freshly spliced were good but the quantity was a bit much.\n\nLastly, given the average taste (and the soggy bun), the price of the meal was a bit on the pricey side.  I would recommend In-N-Out nearby for a fresh burger and fresh-cut potato fries - delicious and reasonably priced.', 'business_id': 'Jlcx_J7DAqXthtsb_OMBEw', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2014-06-08', 'type': 'review'}

I had the Bacon Cheeseburger with Cajun Style Fries, and my wife had the Kosher Style Hot Dog, with Five Guys Style Fries. I ordered my Cheeseburger with extra sauce on it, but it was still a little dry. The Cajun Fries were delicious. My wife\'s Hot Dog and fries were also very good. Very clean Restaurant, but the noise level was very high, and it was only half full of people. I felt the Burgers and Hot Dogs were a little over priced for what you get, but the meals were very tasty.', 'business_id': 'Jlcx_J7DAqXthtsb_OMBEw', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2015-07-23', 'type': 'review'}

So it was never really busy. But they always greeted me and were very nice. The burger ordering process was very new to me. The first time I visited it confused me a bit seeing as there were only like 6 things in the menu. The cashier was always nice and they actually have free peanuts. Most nights I was tired and didn't want to talk to anyone because I was tired but they were always friendly. The burgers were always grease filled lumps of meat with bread. WHICH IS WHAT A BURGER SHOULD BE! Burgers are not healthy and they embrace this happily. It was the best tasting burger I've ever tasted. The only complaint I have about this place is how expensive it is. There isn't anything the staff can do about it so I'm not judging the price to harshly. But five guys come on. Anyways, I would recommend this as an occasional place. Not really a group restaurant price would be to high. But if your hungry for an actual burger and not that healthy fake burger  sh**. This is the place for you. Just a bit steep", 'business_id': 'Jlcx_J7DAqXthtsb_OMBEw', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2015-08-18', 'type': 'review'}
