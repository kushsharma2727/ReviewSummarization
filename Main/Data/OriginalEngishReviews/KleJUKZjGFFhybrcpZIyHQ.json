It\'s very near where we live, so I had high hopes for it being good! Not very many unique, high quality restaurants way out here in the "boonies." We ordered take-out food. \n\nWe ordered a whole barbecued chicken and a pound of brisket. For sides, we got some of the olive cole slaw and french fries. The chicken was really quite good. I ate a breast and it was moist and tender. So many times, the breast meat is dry and flavorless but not here! There was just a bit of BBQ sauce coating the skin. The sauce was slightly sweet but not cloyingly so. The bread and butter jalapeno included with the chicken was a wonderful cross between a chile and a pickle. I will order a side of these next time. \n\nThe brisket was also tender and smokey. They sent it with just a little BBQ sauce mixed in. I wish I would have asked for the hot BBQ sauce. Guess I am just a heat junkie. The sides were just OK. Nothing too good or bad. The fries were pretty much limp by the time we got them home, but that may be unavoidable with take-out food. \n\nFor about $30, we got enough food to feed two people for two + days. Not bad! We will definitely return to Bryan\'s BBQ to try some of the other menu items. I\'m looking forward to tasting that Firebird! Next time, maybe we\'ll dine in and drink some of the good beer they have available, too.\n\nAddendum 12/12/09: I tried the Firebird and it was very hot. The bbq sauce is orange/habanero. I thought I was eating a piece of orange, but it was actually about 1/2 of a habanero pepper!!! That was the most violent reaction I\'ve ever gotten from my GI tract to such a small piece of food. Firebird is very good, but don\'t eat the pieces of habanero.', 'business_id': 'KleJUKZjGFFhybrcpZIyHQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2009-09-09', 'type': 'review'}

I have found a new love...his name is Bryan.. and I love him.\n\nA few months back Alexander told me to check this place out .. and I thought oh sure it's probably good. Boy was I wrong it's not good , it's fantastic!   \n\nFirst, most BBQ joints that are any good are rinky dinky dives  that you try not to touch too many surfaces in ( you know its true!) \n\nBut Bryan my new amore , is different his joint is well decorated, cute even , maybe whimsical. It has clean well lit, well thought out decorating,a large screen with old time westerns showing , nice touch,the place is clean  and in a tasteful strip mall. \n\nThe food is ordered at the counter , we opted for ribs, shredded pork and brisket. The brisket was well cooked / smoked with meat falling apart as you cut into it.The sauce was tasty  but not over powering. No fake smoke taste or over top sugar taste here.  The ribs had a gorgeous pink smoke ring , lovely! Husband proclaimed the   shredded pork better than the ribs but he is wrong and not writing this review.  So there.   \n\nNow here is the extra special touch .. the sides were really delish  no empty fillers here .. the beans are obviously slow cooked with care and dare I say ...love?   I even tasted a hint of beer which I  love in beans , they also had a rich taste that made them crave-able. \nThe coleslaw was  a surprise as well , not only a great balance of taste not too sweet not too vinegary  but low and behold olives were hidden in there as well like little treasures just waiting to be uncovered.  Will I  be back ...oh yes ..Bryan and I plan to see each other at least a couple times a month . I think it's time for him to meet my folks.... I am looking forward to our kinda like a date night .   Can't wait to try him out again!  I mean try the food again .. Whatever I love Bryan.", 'business_id': 'KleJUKZjGFFhybrcpZIyHQ', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2009-09-21', 'type': 'review'}

Needless to say, save the gas.\n\nThe place is cute on the inside and really had a lot of promise.  The sides all sounded good and I couldn\'t decide between the pulled pork or the brisket so I got both.  Added a side of potato salad and a side of beans.  \n\nWhere to begin?\n\nThe pork wasn\'t bad but it wasn\'t bbq.  I mean, it didn\'t taste smokey or sweet.  It tasted boiled...and that\'s nasty.  It was fatty and generally just lacking flavor.  The bbq sauce they put on the thing was decent but they didn\'t have any of it out for me to get more.  What they did have were "regular" and "spicy" bbq sauces.  Both were thin, both were a bit spicy, and neither was up to the task of fixing this pork.\n\nThe brisket was really a disaster.  It was cut like ham slices.  Really thick with a big hunk of fat around the outside that I had to remove from each slice.  This whittled my beef down to medallion sized bits.  The taste was fine but the thick texture, lack of bbq sauce, and fatty presentation was all disappointing.\n\nThe beans were okay but I expected sweeter.  BBQ baked beans, in my mind, should be sweet and savory.  These, like everything else here, were just bland and dull.  I tried mixing some of the runny bbq sauce available but it really didn\'t help.\n\nThe saving grace was the potato salad.  This was some of the best stuff I\'ve ever had.  I would totally buy a pound of that to bring to a dinner party.  They should package it and sell it in the stores.  Really it was creamy and sweet without overpowering the potato flavor.  Good stuff and well executed.\n\nWill not be going back here.  Too bad too because it had a lot of promise.  Oh well.

During our fall break, the husband and I were knocking out quite a few of the best new restaurants in Phoenix Magazine, and this happened to be one of them.  I was pretty excited because I really like barbecue and it's fun to compare different places.  Unfortunately, this place didn't compare to any other BBQ place.  I honestly thought it was terrible, almost to the point of being inedible.\n\nThe restaurant itself is pretty cute.  I love the old western movies playing, the decor is rustic and cute, and its very clean inside.  Unfortunately, it must have been a really really REALLY off day for them, especially considering the raves from Deb (and I trust her reviews.)  I ordered the beef brisket with a side of the Cowboy Olive Cole Slaw.  It sounded fascinating.  Before our meal arrived I got some extra BBQ sauce, and that was the first indicator that this would be no good for me.\n\nHonestly, the sauce tasted like hot sauce with a little bit of ketchup in it.  It was really watery, and I like really thick sauces.  I just really hated the flavor.  My brisket was terribly dry and overcooked.  There was no falling apart as I cut it, mostly just sawing motions to get through the nearly 1/2 inch slab.  I think brisket should be cut much thinner than that.  Fortunately, there was a decent smokey flavor that was present, and that made my meat palatable.  I figured the cole slaw would be better.  It wasn't.  It really just tasted like someone emptied a can of olive juice into a generic batch of cole slaw.\n\nThe only thing worth eating here was the baked potato salad, but it wasn't my side dish to eat.  This place was a big ol let down for me.  Like I said, this must have been a really bad day for them, because I don't think you win one of the best new restaurant spots for nothing.", 'business_id': 'KleJUKZjGFFhybrcpZIyHQ', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2009-11-03', 'type': 'review'}

However, it also looks like people who have written reviews here have very picky tastes and particular thoughts about exactly what their BBQ should be like.  That's what makes BBQ so great!  The debate rages on...\n\nFor what it's worth, I side with the Bryan's lovers here.  This place is worth the drive out the Cave Creek.  From the second you park your car and get out, you can smell the delicious-ness.  Your mouth will be watering before you get in the door.\n\nThe menu is the standard BBQ fare you would except for one twist - the pulled squash sandwich.  ***Vegetarians unite***  No longer does the BBQ community cast you aside for there is a fantastic sandwich waiting for you.  For the sandwich, they used spaghetti squash, heat it up, and finish it on the grill with BBQ sauce & a toasted bun.  It was fan-freaking-tastic.  I liked the squash so much I got it as a side when I went back with the family in tow.\n\nI also had the brisket & chicken.  My partners in crime volunteer to round out our menu orderings and got the ribs and pulled pork.  The brisket was super tender, and the chicken was moist.  It's easy to dry chicken out, and I give much props for a delicious bird.  The best were the ribs though.  Not only did they look perfect, outer crunch of caramelized sauce and a subtle smoke ring, but tasted damn near perfect too.\n\nAs for the sauces, I will say they aren't nearly as bad as some people here claim.  They aren't as thick and over-flavored like grocery store versions, but they are good.  They are thinner and have a nice acidic vinegar pop.  They were a perfect touch to the pork & chicken.\n\nI think the thing that helped set this a part from other places was the killer craft beer selection.  if one more person offers me a bud or coors light with BBQ, I might cry.  Good food deserves good brew, and this place has an ample supply of great flavors that would pair well with anything.  Bryan, who is usually there working, knows his stuff.\n\nOther great stuff - look for the specials.  The night the fam went, we split an order of fresh watermelon drizzled with Jalapeno-Cardamom Honey & topped with diced Jalapenos.

It is so hard NOT to stop in for dinner everytime I pick her up. Lately it has been a frequent go-to spot for the family when we are too tired to make dinner, or when we want to indulge in the best BBQ we've ever had. The week wouldn't be complete without eating at Bryan's at least once. AT LEAST.\n\nI always get the pulled pork sandwich which has just the right amount of spice and flavor. I always add a little spicy BBQ sauce for that extra kick. The bun is slightly toasted and the edges have that little crunch, while the middle of the bun is soft from the moisture of the pulled pork.  Their fries are addicting, and served as a side in generous heaps with the perfect amount of salt. Their cole slaw has sliced olives- both black and green- which give it a very pleasant and interesting twist. I have yet to try their ribs, because when I find something I like, I stick to it. But after reading some reviews on here I see that it's a must. \n\nOh, and you get a free soft drink if you wear a funny hat on Fridays.

In the distance you hear the sound of  building thunder. There isn\'t a cloud in the sky but the thunder grows louder & the ground begins to tremble. The tranquil landscape around you is transformed as a massive herd of Bison rushes past in a terrifying blur of horns & hide. Now open your eyes and don\'t be afraid, BBQ has arrived in Cave Creek, Arizona!\n\nNow I\'ve had Bison several times before, though never the ribs, and have always found it to be a bit tough, chewy and somewhat gamey.  Having had the pleasure of several of Bryan\'s signature menu items previously, I jumped at the opportunity for a first taste.\n\nOn my arrival, I was greeted by Chef Dooley (generally behind the counter ready to carve to order), who came out and spoke to me about what his ideas of BBQ in general and this dish in particular are all about.  "Simple, BOLD flavor,\' is the Chef\'s mantra and the basis for everything they do.  Bringing the natural beefy flavor of  Bison to Bryan\'s BBQ just fits in with what they are doing in this well "seasoned" building where the theme is a modern interpretation of classic BBQ flavors.\n\nSix piping hot ribs were set before me and I immediately noticed the deep pink ring imparted by smoking over Pecan wood.  A taste of the sweet Persimmon Glaze let me know what I was in for as I picked up a rib.  Upon taking my first bite, I immediately noticed how tender, lean and flavorful these ribs were, giving just the right amount of pull from the bone but not coming clean off. (Contrary to popular misconception, properly cooked ribs will not fall off the bone! The only ribs that fall off the bone are those that have been boiled and steamed. This process usually robs the ribs of flavor because water is a solvent. Steamed and boiled ribs usually have a mushy texture. Properly cooked ribs will pull cleanly off the bone with your teeth, but will still have some resilience and chew.)\n\nPersimmons are a fruit that I have not had much experience eating/cooking with but the sweet, slightly tangy flavor worked quite well when rubbed with Bryan\'s mix of sage, juniper berries and a hint of black pepper.  The things that struck me most about this dish were how well balanced the flavors were and the natural "beefiness" of the meat.  My mind wandered back to that open, grassy plain and with each bite I could literally envision the massive heards of wild Bison that once roamed freely.\n\nAs a self professed BBQ fanatic and creator of a line of BBQ sauces and Dry spice rub, I tend to be much less forgiving in my opinion of what "good BBQ\' is.  Without reservation, I can tell you that Bryan\'s get\'s it right, Chef Bryan Dooley is passionate about BBQ! I happen to know that his hands touch every piece of meat that crosses the counter into a guest\'s waiting hands. Judging from the quality of this and the other menu items I\'ve had personally, I can say that Chef Dooley\'s motto of "simple, BOLD flavors" has been superbly executed.\n\nAs a side note, since this item was not  available for purchase when I dined, Chef Dooley generously allowed me to try it free of charge.  This consideration in no way contributed to my opinion of this or any other dish served at Bryan\'s Black Mountain BBQ.', 'business_id': 'KleJUKZjGFFhybrcpZIyHQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2010-11-10', 'type': 'review'}

Unfortunately we were behind some "lookie loos" that have never eaten BBQ before and had to have everything explained to them in detail...  IT\'S BBQ, nothing fancy so order and move it! \n\nI had ribs with baked beans and coleslaw.  Ribs were very good but had a bit too much sauce on them.  The beans were delicious and the coleslaw was terrible due to the olives and it was too dry.  I love olives but not in coleslaw!\n\nMy bride and son had pulled pork sandwiches with potato salad and fries.  The pulled pork was very good as were the fries however their potato salad had way too much dill. It was more of a "dill salad" with a little bit of potato. \n\nWe finished with fried apples with cinnamon, pepper corns and a dusting of sugar.  Sounded great but found it too greasy to eat.\n\nTheir ribs and pulled pork were good enough to leave you wanting more.  \n\nWe are looking forward to our next visit to Bryan\'s so we can try their brisket, chicken and veggie style pulled squash!

I'd go back again and enjoyed my first experience.\n\nI was enjoying a day of meandering around Cave Creek and was getting hungry for lunch.  Walked past Bryan's and caught a wiff of their wonderful smokehouse smell.  It built on me and a block past I turned around and decided to try it.  Saw several local office folk going in so I followed them. The pulled pork sandwich was excpetional, great texture and flavor to the meat. \n\nWhile I waited for my lunch I tried the two types of sauces from the condiments dispensers; normal and hot.  Alone, the sauce flavors seemed to lean too far towards tomato-ey for what I imagined BBQ sauce should be.  But when my meal came the flavor spectrum melded with the pork wonderfully.  Lesson learned:  Don't judge the BBQ sauce flavors alone, they gotta hit the meat.\n\nMy side was the potato salad, which I'd normally not think much of.  The Chef had used Baked Potato chunks which added a nice base flavor, then mixed them in with a thick, creamy dill sauce.  The baked tones complimented the herb and cream flavors so very well.  OMG it was tasty, I ended up finger licking that stuff out of the ramikan.\n\nOn the negative side, they serve lunch sandwiches in a basket lined with lightweight paper.  If any sauce gets on the paper it starts to get weak and can end up in your food.  Not  aproblem if you're a clean and neat BBQ consumer, but who is?  At one point I pulled a little bit of paper out of my mouth that had attached itself to my wet sandwich.  yuk.\nAlso, my bill showed that Cave Creek is hitting folks up with 10.27% sales tax.

Overall I have to say that they cook / smoke their meats perfectly, everything is super tasty, and I will be happy to go back for more, regardless of the 20 minute drive to get there. I have been living in AZ now for almost a year, and to date this is by far the best BBQ I have had, and I have tried a lot including all of the popular ones.

But please, if you are going to make the drive (we came from Gilbert and we would do it again!) they have two seasonal items right now...watermelon slices with jalapeno, honey, and dash of cardamom, and an heirloom tomato sandwich. These two items are only served while they are in season, and I can personally speak for the watermelon that you have never, and will never have it like this. The flavors compliment the watermelon so well; it is so refreshing, sweet, barely spicy, crisp, and just really not what you\'d expect.

I've actually been to Bryan's over 75 times since they opened in '09. I've also brought 20-30 others into Bryan's and no one, including myself, has ever been less than delighted with every aspect of this establishment and their food. \n\nIn response to a couple negative reviews -\n\nFries - Indeed the fries will be soggy if you let them sit for 30 minutes, take them home, and eat them later. However, they are perfectly crispy if you eat them during your visit. They are some of the best fries in the valley actually. \n\nBuns - The buns are grilled perfectly to achieve a golden layer of deliciousness which prevents the bun from absorbing moisture. Again, if you don't eat any BBQ right away, it gets weird later on. Eat it immediately and grab two napkins - one to clean your mouth and one to dry your tears...it's THAT good.\n\nColeslaw - This is the best coleslaw I've ever had. Bryan includes the perfect amount of high-quality olives in the slaw which sets it apart from the pretenders out there serving store-bought coleslaw. \nRibs - Real BBQ ribs are NOT supposed to fall off the bone. That's reserved for crockpot and boiled ribs, which are not barbecued. These ribs are amazing. \n\nSauce - Sauce is the one area of BBQ that's extremely subjective. It's similar to salad dressing, and other condiments, in that regard. Personally, it's the best BBQ sauce I've ever had and I have a cupboard full of it at home. However, some like their sauce sweet, some like it with mustard, some like vinegar, some like spice, some like ketchup, etc. I make a lot of sauce at home, and I've never made sauce this good. If you want a great selection of really sweet sauce, try Famous Dave's. For a unique, amazing, perfect sauce (in my opinion at least) go to Bryan's immediately. \n\nBeer - The beer selection is one of the best in the valley. Bryan has hand-selected every bottle and his choices are impressive. Mostly local, craft, microbrew selections. Good prices too - that can be said for everything on the menu. \n\nIf you had a bad experience at Bryan's, which is almost impossible for me to believe because I'm 75 for 75 here, please consider trying it again. Not for the sake of the business, but for your own sake. It's so amazing, I feel obligated to tell everyone about it and make them go. Heck, I'll meet you there and buy your meal if it's not incredible. Or, the owners will probably buy you another meal if you were disappointed the first time. They are very nice and are very proud of their food.  \n\nThe belly rules the mind. ~ Spanish Proverb\n\nNothing would be more tiresome than eating and drinking if God had not made them a pleasure as well as a necessity. ~ Voltaire", 'business_id': 'KleJUKZjGFFhybrcpZIyHQ', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2011-08-04', 'type': 'review'}

The artichoke hearts were nicely and lightly fried, the sandwich had an amazing creamy garlic and mustard sauce piled plentifully, the bread was buttered and toasted to a very nice crispiness, and there were fresh tomatoes and real romaine lettuce.\n- Pulled Squash: So unique and soooo incredibly good. The bun is buttered to high heaven and combined with the hot squash covered in an amazing BBQ, every bite is just marvelous. Sweet, savory, buttery, smooth, firm, yummmo. I prefer this to the fried artichoke po'boy.\n- Baked potato salad: Yummy take on traditional potato salad but I think the french fries are the best side they have (and worth the extra quarter).\n- Olive Coleslaw: Not a huge fan of coleslaw, but this seemed better to me than most. Balanced sweetness and the coolness goes really well with the hot Pulled Squash sandwich.\n- French fries: Perfect - dark, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside without being mealy, and seasoned nicely. M\n- Brisket sandwich: My husband gets this,  and while he said wasn't as good as others he has had, it must still be yummy because he orders it everytime. \n\nWe both really liked the spicy bbq sauce - it's not as sweet as the light color would suggest and it has a really pleasant smokiness to it.

I'm not one of those people from KC or Texas that go seek out the best BBQ places around - so take my review with a grain of salt that I'm no BBQ expert with opinions on different sauces, etc.\n\nCame here for lunch with two kids and everyone thought the food was really good. I had a plate with chicken and brisket because I'm not a big sandwich person. Everyone at our table loved the chicken the best I think - which is crazy! I tend to frequently get vegan meals, so I'm super excited to try the squash BBQ sandwich... since I love squash and it sounds fantastic from the other reviews.\n\nKids had pulled pork sandwich and ribs in the children's meals. Daughter didn't care for the ribs - but she's 9 and doesn't like blackened / charred food like every other kid. Other daughter had pulled pork sandwich and was in heaven! I really enjoyed the potato salad - rich with a strong fresh dill flavor. Cowboy beans weren't my favorite, and I love beans, but something about the flavor of cowboy beans doesn't do it for me. Contrary to the other reviews, I thought the fries were fantastic! They weren't soggy at all and very fresh - hard not to eat a lot of them. \n\nGenius are the Wiki Stick packs that they give to kids with children's menus! Never seen them before, and the kids had a good ol' time trying to form cowboys from the wiki sticks (instructions included).

I also like that they have a decent selection of food to choose from as well.\n\nOverall, we really enjoyed our time here. If your in the area, or want to try excellent BBQ, please, go eat here.

AND, portion size has not decreased, nor has menu price increased.  That alone speaks volumes about how Bryan totally "gets it".  And the staff is just as friendly and hospitable as ever.  Truly - I walk in there and I feel like every member of Bryan\'s staff is concerned about how happy I am with my dining experience.\n\nNow, he has added some new menu items.  But, keep in mind - this guy is a CIA grad (read:  real Chef, not a "cook" or backyard BBQ enthusiast), so I love when he flexes his food muscle.  But, ALL of the original core menu items are still here.  Heck, the menu board is the same as when he opened.  lol\n\nBut besides the food being completely yummy with huge portions and terrific value, the restaurant is always totally clean and inviting.  I have never once come in here and not been warmly greeted, and I\'ve always sat at a table that was entirely clean.\n\nProbably my *only* complaint about Bryan\'s, is that he\'s closed on SUN and MON.  I know a guy needs some time off, but I hope he feels confident one day to turn over the reigns, so that us junkies can eat every day of the week.  \n\nSo, the "must haves"  - the ribs are to die for.  Thick, meaty, fall-off-the bone, but not in that "they\'re disintegrating because they\'re mostly fat or overcooked" kinda way. The spicy BBQ sauce - I want to bathe in it or put a dab behind my ears and on my wrists.  Even the pulled chicken is always moist (do you know how hard this is to pull off with lean meats??).   And the fries.  Oh, the fries.  Absolutely the best anywhere.  Hand cut, made fresh for every order and just the right combo of crisp and meaty.  Potato salad - divine.  Potatoes are the right firmness, a perfect amount of dill and mayo.  Olive cole slaw?  Wish I thought of it, but since I didn\'t, I come to Bryan to get my slaw on.\n\nDo yourself a favor.  Or, flavor.  Come to Bryan\'s.  And do yourself another favor and bring home take-out, because you\'ll want this stuff the next day again.\n\nP.S.

I'm not the biggest fan of the beans, but I like everything else. All meals come with a house-made pickled jalapeno too, if that's something you're interested in! \n\nThe meat is served with sauce, but it's pretty stingy so make sure to visit the counter along the wall to get either spicy of original sauce. I love that they keep it heated so you can pour warm sauce all over your dinner! Also, if you buy Bryan's cookbook (which is great - all his restaurant recipes are in there!) he will sign it for you. We just made the dill potato salad this weekend and it tasted just like it does in the restaurant. \n\nA couple notes: \n\nIt gets REALLY busy on the weekends and closes at 8 so make sure to get there early if you don't want to wait in a long line and stand around lurking for a table\n\nBe careful if you order the chocolate chip ice cream cookie sandwich (not worth the calories if you ask me!)

Recently, I finally had the chance to try this divey BBQ shop and my mouth hasn't since stopped watering for a second, third and fourth visit! \n\nThis is a no-frills BBQ restaurant filled with charm and aromas that excite any taste buds. It's exactly how a BBQ restaurant should be! We stood in line and watched (who I believe was) Bryan himself along with his co-chefs whip up delicious BBQ made-to-order. I decided to order the pulled pork BBQ sandwich while my husband went with the beef brisket topped with a fried egg (yes a fried egg! It's an add-on). The sandwich came with a side so I went for the fries. After we ordered and paid, we went to find a seat inside. They also have seating outside and plenty of cute shops to browse while you wait. \n\nNow on to the food! First of all, they have my favorite Coca Cola machine with about 50 different coke product options! I decided to sip on my favorite, the Diet Cherry Vanilla Coke that I can only find in these coke machines. We then filled plastic containers with piping hot BBQ sauce and dug in. The pulled pork is tender, juicy and full of flavor. Now I know what BBQ should taste like! The bun was buttery goodness and I didn't care one bit about the calories I was consuming with each butter-filled bite. The BBQ sauce was tangy and the perfect bit of sweet flavor to top the tender BBQ. I tried both the spicy and regular BBQ sauce and couldn't taste a different but loved the flavor of the sauce. I was also pleasantly surprised by the flavoring of the french fries and noticed a salty flavorful seasoning. I gobbled up every bite and happily entered a food coma. I will be coming back often and also plan on picking some up for takeout.

I love good barbecue so I agreed to at least come in with an open mind.  Long story short, Little Miss BBQ is still the best by far.  That said, there's plenty to like about Bryan's place and you'd probably come away pretty happy after making the drive to Cave Creek to try this place.\n\nAs with so much of Cave Creek, the ambiance and feel of the area is old western all the way.  A large prominently placed cactus greets you as you enter this old row of wooden buildings leading to the front entrance to Bryan's.  Inside the feel is very much that of a barbecue joint, though perhaps cleaner and more orderly with a hint of modern flare.  No waiter service here.  You order your food at the register, take a seat, and wait about 5-10 minutes for your named to be called to pick up your food at the counter.  The menu is prominently displayed as you wait in line as well as a daily special for those feeling more adventurous (the special dish today was smoked veal).  My friend raved about their pulled pork and I wanted to compare the brisket to Little Miss BBQ.  Solution:  The two meat plate.  Pulled pork, brisket, and a choice of two sides (I went with their beans and coleslaw).  To drink, I just got a water, but they actually have a very respectable selection of local and regional craft beers to choose from.  FYI, another reason my friend loves this place is because they have vegetarian barbecue items.  She LOVES their pulled squash sandwich, honey jalape\xf1o watermelon, and their romaine lettuce with house made rub.\n\nTotal price for the food and a drink was just under $20.  One complaint about the food right off the bat is they serve their barbecue with the sauce already applied to the meats.  I'm someone who believes the best barbecue doesn't need sauce.  That said, Bryan's is very clear that they don't accept adaptations to their dishes.  So fine, I'll eat the meat with the sauce already applied.  The pulled pork was very good and plenty moist.  Brisket was smoky, though the meat was a tad dry for me.  The sauce was of the mild variety so it was a relatively subtle accompaniment to the meat, but there's was plenty on the meat to let you know it was there.  I was very impressed with the beans and the coleslaw.  Admittedly I love olives so the addition of olives into the coleslaw was a nice surprise.  The portions were such that I was satisfied, full, but not uncomfortably full.\n\nBottomline, its not Little Miss BBQ.  Not even close.  But if you're a fan of Phoenix barbecue institutions like Bobby Q or Pork on a Fork, this is pretty on par with those spots and possibly better on some dishes.  Very family friendly place too as there were plenty of parents with kids and the place was pretty busy overall.  If I were to come here again next time I'd probably go for one of their specials and see what smoked veal or whatever they're cooking up that day would taste like.  As for the traditional barbecue staples, good, though I've had better.

They were right, it is an excellent BBQ spot. I had the two-meat combo with shredded chicken and brisket, both were the appropriate amount of smoke and had excellent flavor. For sides I had the potato salad and coleslaw because those are standards that you have to try. The potato salad was really good, with a dill dressing that is unique and flavorful. The coleslaw will be a love or not kind of situation, and I didn't love it. They use green olives in it which for me gave it a very strange flavor, though it's similar to a Regal Slaw that I make, which is lighter and without tons of mayo. They have sweet pickled jalape\xf1os with the meal that are really good! Can't believe that no one has thought to do that before. I tried my friend's tomato sandwich as well, which was excellent, their fries are well done and the sweetbread jalape\xf1o poppers are something to behold! To top it off, I ordered the watermelon for dessert which comes with a generous portion, topped with honey and cardamom, a unique and delicious way to end a meal! \nThey have one of the new choose you mix Coke machines which was cool, the setting was nice and it's modern, aside from the bathrooms being outside the restaurant, though they are easily accessible, both from distance and ADA compliance. I would definitely return here and would probably be a regular if I lived nearby, though you can tell many people are because it does quite a brisk business.", 'business_id': 'KleJUKZjGFFhybrcpZIyHQ', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2014-06-09', 'type': 'review'}

You drive about 15 miles through the desert on a Cactus Scenic Drive and the sights are just amazing. Cave Creek -- when I got there -- was having a biker festival so it was crowded and I didn't see a place to stop. Looked like a cute little touristy town though. The restaurant is about a mile beyond and wasn't too crowded. \n\nWhen you arrive, there's additional parking around the back and the restaurant has a nice outdoor seating area. It's looks the part of a BBQ spot, but isn't a dive by any means. It looks local, western, a little kitschy, but fun. There's the right amount of neon. Service was friendly and I didn't wait too long after ordering for my food to be ready for pickup. \n\n2) Opportunities for growth: Once I got the food, I found the issues. I ordered a two-meat combo (ribs and brisket) and a side of cornbread which allegedly is baked in brisket drippings ($3.75!), and a bottle of the house beer.  The beer was okay. I wouldn't purchase anything else there again. Brisket was re-heated and lost any smoke flavor or color in the process. In fact, neither the brisket nor the ribs had ANY discernible flavor profile at all. The sauce didn't do much to help the matter. And the overpriced cornbread was so crumbly it was almost inedible. \n\nThe folks are friendly and the drive is nice, but if you're looking for good BBQ, look elsewhere.", 'business_id': 'KleJUKZjGFFhybrcpZIyHQ', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2015-03-30', 'type': 'review'}

I did not try the chicken because there is no way to mess up a rotisserie chicken right? (Maybe). But any how the Brisket was the best of the meats as it was juicy and lightly smoked. The pork ribs and pulled pork tasted three days old! The ribs even had a left on the bone too long smell.  The rib meat was hard like jerky! The pull pork was left in fridge and you could taste it!

This little hidden away spot in Cave Creek is absolutely outstanding! \n\nThe layout is a bit unorthodox, as I was truly expecting a sit-down, get waited on, kind of a BBQ place... but who cares?! The service is wonderful and the food is mouthwateringly amazing. When you pull up to the place, your stomach already starts growling since you can smell the BBQ as soon as you start walking up. Then you go on inside and up to the counter where the pleasant, and friendly employees take your order (and even help you decide/order if you've never been there before... like me). The melt-in-your-mouth meats and brisket selections are extensive, whether you like beef, pork, or chicken. And depending on how hungry you are, or if you get a platter, you get to pick two finger-licking good sides. Once you order, you wait (impatiently) for your food to come out, and wait for your name to be called. \n\nBeing that it was my first time there, I went straight for the brisket... couldn't decide which meat I wanted -- beef or chicken -- so I figured why even chose? Why not have both?! So that's exactly what I did; and boy oh boy I was not disappointed. I also ordered some corn bread that was fresh and still warm, with melted butter... yum! It was so amazing because not only do I love warm yummy corn bread, but it also had a hint of smokey flavor to it, just like it would have been cooked over an open flame around a camp fire. \n\nAfter what felt like an eternity (but this was only because I was so hungry my stomach was beginning to digest itself and I was counting the seconds...), I finally heard my name being called! I jumped for joy and ran up to the counter to grab my brisket, potato salad, corn bread, baked beans, and coleslaw. (Umm yes, I WAS hungry!) I savored this amazing brisket (I prefer beef over the chicken), and all the sides were just wow -- so flavorful! Of course my eyes were definitely bigger than my stomach, so I brought the rest home... and you know what that meant?! Yup!

That is until today.  After hearing about Bryan's Black Mountain Barbecue on Check Please! Arizona (hosted by former Roaring Fork owner Robert McGrath), we decided to venture out to Cave Creek and give it a shot.  My bride ordered a pulled pork sandwich and I ordered a two item platter (pulled pork and more pulled pork, please!)  My side items were potato salad and baked beans, while my wife got potato salad only.  \n\nOur consensus was the pulled pork was truly exceptional--as good as you would find in one of the nationally famous barbecue joints in a place like Kansas City, MO, Austin, TX or Lexington, NC.  There was no fat on the pulled pork, just tender meat that included the blackened part of the pork (burnt ends, in barbecue lingo).  Every bit was delicious.  They offer two sauces to add to the cue, one spicy and one regular, and both are heated so as to not cool down the meat.  The potato salad was similarly tasty, with a great dressing to accompany the freshly diced potatoes.  Only the barbecue beans were, alas, just average.  Unfortunately, we were too stuffed to try either of the dessert items that were available.  The restaurant also offers a variety of beers, some of which are brewed under the Bryan's label.  We both signed a sacred pact that next time we would sample the brisket and the ribs in order to confirm our suspicions that this is a place that belongs in the barbecue Hall of Fame.  By coming in mid-July, we also missed the long lines that many of the other reviewers have commented on.\n\nFor those reviewers who gave this place one or two stars, I have two bits of advice:  1.  Go to a Vegan restaurant next time.  2.  Next time you are tempted to write a Yelp review, go in the kitchen with Sydney, Clayton, Mohammed and Jugdish and ponder whether you should find a new hobby.", 'business_id': 'KleJUKZjGFFhybrcpZIyHQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2015-07-17', 'type': 'review'}

The famous olive cole slaw was a FAIL in our opinions, but it definitely wasn't the normal slaw. Count us in the DO NOT column. The beans were disappointing too because the brisket was good, so I thought they would take some Texas bean pointers too, but nope. Maybe if you had a six-pack before eating the Six Pack beans, they would taste better! Har har. The potato salad was decent, but a little heavy on the mayo. The fries were fresh and not soggy. My husband liked the beer selection. I doubt we will try to fight the crowd for the Frog Leg Friday, but maybe. The homemade ice cream sandwich looked tasty too. Another reason for the 3 star rating instead of 4 was because the service was lacking. We were never asked how the food was after it was lacklusterly dropped on the table and our drinks were never full. We had to ask for beer twice. I would say there were about 10 tables total at the time. Not satisfactory in my opinion.", 'business_id': 'KleJUKZjGFFhybrcpZIyHQ', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2015-08-22', 'type': 'review'}

Yes ... it's just a little more $ than a place like Honey Bears, but Bryan is a foodie and he is very serious about his BBQ. He is usually standing behind the counter preparing the food so you can easily talk to him. He's friendly and very approachable. There is always something interesting and definitely unusual on the menu that you can try if you are adventurous. I enjoy the pulled pork sandwiches, but my favorite is the summer tomato sandwich with a fried egg on top -- it's even better when the tomatoes are room temperature rather than just out of the walk in.", 'business_id': 'KleJUKZjGFFhybrcpZIyHQ', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2015-09-05', 'type': 'review'}
