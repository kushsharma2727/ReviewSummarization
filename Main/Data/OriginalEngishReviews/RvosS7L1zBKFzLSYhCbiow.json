They were still installing the security system so they're still figuring things out, based on their website, this is their 1st and only location thus far.  The measures of good corn tortillas for me are: are they fresh and do they fall apart - and these are really good.  The fish and shrimp were fresh and tasty and the cheesy pepper was a nice touch.  The salsa bar is nicely stocked with different salsas / condiments similar to what you'd find in Mexico.

It has been saying coming soon for quite some time now. Then I noticed the doors where finally open so over for lunch I came. My coworker who was with me chickened out and went next door to the corporate Chinese place. I am glad I decided to come here. It was really good.\nThe menu is pretty simple. Not that much on it and the prices are fairly reasonable. They have fish tacos, of course, and shrimp tacos. I decided to go with the Full Taco per the recommendation of the cashier. The Full Taco has fish and shrimp on a corn tortilla with a stuffed yellow pepper. The cheese in the pepper proceeds to melt all over the inside of the taco and makes it that much better.\nBefore you take you food to go or sit down to eat make sure you hit up the toppings bar. With all kinds of salsa and other goodies to jazz up your taco a little.\nI also got fries and a drink. I did get two tacos which with the fries turned out to be more than enough. The total was $11 but with just one taco, fries and a drink I think it would be more in line with any other fast food place.\nThe fries are really good. They fry them in the batter and wow. It makes them so much better than your regular fries.\nThe restaurant is very clean and modern with TV screens of menu boards. The minor complaint is that the soda fountain is behind the counter. So they have to serve you your soda which slows things down just a little. But it is just a minor thing and not a big deal at all.\nSince this place is so close to work and so good I will definitely be back.

We discovered Tortilla Fish during one of our late night trips to Walmart. We totally drooled over the idea of a little taco shop (Rob especially, as he loves tacos from San Felipe). We promised that we would go back during business hours.\n\nYesterday, we were in the area and decided to stop at Tortilla Fish. Not sure what to expect, we walked in to Tortilla Fish\'s TOTALLY ADORABLE little restaurant. The walls are blue with some fun subway tile, with lots of beautiful photos. Clean and cozy are two of the words that come to my mind. I got so excited when I later noticed the sea shells in the subway tile. So cute and original.\n\nThe employees were really friendly, especially when we told them it was our first time in. They gave us recommendations, told us about their best sellers, and even gave us some sauce combinations to try. Supremo customer service at this place.\n\nI ordered two shrimp tacos and a cup of water. Rob got the full taco, a fish taco, and a soda. I think the total came to $15.22, which I thought was quite reasonable for two people. The tacos were $2.99-ish each, so I could easily see spending more than $15 if you came in HUNGRY.\n\nOur order came up after only a few minutes, and OH BOY! The shrimp in my tacos were HUGE and there were plenty of them. Two thumbs up for emphasis on the SHRIMP in shrimp tacos. The fish in Rob\'s taco was stacked so high, he grabbed a fork (but didn\'t end up using it except to clean out the dish when we had finished).\n\nI used the avocado and cilantro sauces on my tacos, with cabbage and onion and fresh cilantro, and all I can say is YUM YUM YUM. And the corn tortillas? Brilliant. Very soft and tasty-- though a word to the wise, if you plan to overload your taco with accessories, the tortilla may break (which, for most of us, is no problem. Give me a fork or I\'ll eat it with my fingers. Tastes good all the same). Lastly, I really appreciated that the contents of the salad bar are clearly fresh; they looked pretty and tasted great too. \n\nRob LOVED the full taco and the fish taco (to quote him, "all that was missing was a beach with no surf"). He used a combination of pico de gallo, cilantro sauce, and (I think) the extra spicy salsa. We were definitely a fan of this little place, so I think we will be returning soon.  Rob and I  say four out of five stars and would definitely recommend if you are in the mood for some clean, tasty tacos.\n\nPS: Don\'t forget your phone in the car, because you get 15% off your order with your first Yelp check in. No worries, I will save it for our next visit!\n\n-------------Update!---------------\nAfter writing this review today, and then reading it over with Rob, we decided to go back to Tortilla Fish for lunch. That\'s right, less than 24 hours from our initial visit, we returned. And AGAIN, the food was delicious.\n\nThe employees remembered us, said "Welcome back!" and thanked us. A+ guys. Thank YOU!\n\nI tried the fish taco today and WHOA. I think it is my new favorite. The fish was so moist and delicious it melted in my mouth. Topped with cilantro and avocado sauce and fresh cabbage, onion, and cilantro again, definitely a win.\n\nAlso...do yourself a favor and get the french fries. No, seriously. When one of the  employees said "We have the best fries I have ever tasted" I was skeptical, but I think he\'s onto something.  These fries were EASILY some of the best I\'ve ever had, if not the best. They\'re a nice size and density, and are even a little flakey on the outside. Serious and overwhelming yum for these fries. Oh, and for a tasty treat, drip them in the chipotle sauce. Really flavorful and smokey. Thumbs up, all around.\n\nRob had two full tacos this time and was just as pleased today as he was yesterday. Bumping up to a 5 star from my original 4. Tortilla fish, we\'ll DEFINITELY be back.', 'business_id': 'RvosS7L1zBKFzLSYhCbiow', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2013-09-27', 'type': 'review'}

We dropped in for a snack in between meals and opted for the combo. 2 tacos of your choice a side of fries and a drink for 8.99. We got 2 full fish tacos which was both fish and shrimp. They bread and fry the seafood which is just the way I like it. They give you tacos plain (just tortilla, pepper, cheese and fish-they don't skimp) but their salsa bar is where it's at. Here you customize your taco. They have an array of salsas, sauces, veggies, and even coleslaw to top your tacos with. I LOVE THIS!  The coleslaw was crisp and fresh, pico was on point, no mushy over processed salsas here!  They also had squeeze bottles of mayo, chipotle dressing, cilantro dressing, ranch and of course hot sauces. All were awesome.  I almost got full off 1 taco! Now their fries, you don't expect much but these were some of the crispiest fries I've ever had! The tacos were very reminiscent of some we've had in Baja Mexico and I'm so glad we found some here. \n\nService was on point. Ruben the co owner was very friendly and while we ate our tacos he was very attentive to other patrons and even took the time to explain the salsa bar to a gentlemen.

The fish was fresh and tasty and the light batter was very complimentary, not a lot of fluffy filler.  \nThe salsa/condiment bar was far from what you might typically see (Baja Fresh, America's Taco Shop, etc.).  Not to say anything bad about any of those but this one is just different.  Loved the cilantro sauce and the hot habanero salsa.  You can choose between chopped cabbage or a (dry) slaw as one of your toppings too.  But really, what's a fish taco without cabbage?  \nAnd let me tell you, their version of tartar sauce is not what you might expect either -creamy, light, refreshing compliment to the fish.  Wish I could just order the first alone just so I could enjoy some of their tartar sauce with. \nThey also have a hot oil.   Interesting.  \nI went with the Full and and one other.

But I gotta give the local guys a shot and I\'m glad I did.\n\nOrdered the shrimp tacos, added beer battered fries for the table and snagged the free drink check-in offer. Didn\'t have to wait long for our tacos and was pleasantly surprised to find that they don\'t pre-build the tacos for you. After they cook up your fish and put it in a fresh corn tortilla, you get to put the rest of it together using the nearby bar. This is a HUGE plus for me because far too often I\'ve had fish tacos elsewhere that were drenched with some nasty mayo based cream sauce that I can\'t stomach. Here though, I was able to load my shrimps up with shredded cabbage, pico de gallo, some bomb salsa, and cilantro. WORD OF WARNING: They are not exaggerating about their heat levels. When they say hot, they mean hot. I went with the hottest salsa and got a good burn going, despite how used to spicy food I am. So choose with caution. One of the staff members was kind enough to give a couple of recommendations on what to put on the tacos as well which I\'m glad I listened to them because I would have missed out on the cilantro sauce.\n\nThe end result? Freakin\' excellent! Very fresh fish and fantastic toppings. Found out after I\'d inhaled my first taco that all the sauces are made in house daily which explains why it tastes freakin amazing and fresh. The beer battered fries were also great. I recommend sharing them though because you get quite a bit.\n\nOverall, a great dining experience and great customer service. My only gripe is that they close a bit earlier than other taco restaurants which makes it difficult for me to eat there for dinner given my work hours. Otherwise I\'m glad I gave them a try. Will definitely need to come here again sometime soon.', 'business_id': 'RvosS7L1zBKFzLSYhCbiow', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2014-04-16', 'type': 'review'}

One is that everything seems so fresh, and the other is that despite my initial impression that the tacos are small, I always leave here full and satisfied. Honestly, the thing I cannot get over is the condiment bar. It is kept chilled and offers all manner of extra taco fillings... fresh salsas, chopped cabbage, limes, peppers, and the squeeze bottles of creamy sauces. I cannot discern what makes the Ranch Dressing here taste a hundredfold better than any other. Is it real buttermilk? Is it whipped up fresh every day? Do they add extra garlic or spices? I can\'t place it but it is phenomenal.\n\nThe other striking thing about Tortilla Fish is that I can no longer eat fish tacos without french fries. Their fries are absolute heaven when you pair them with my own concoction of fry sauce: It\'s half ketchup and half creamy chipotle dressing. Like their Ranch, the Creamy Chipotle is second-to-none. And the fish taco options keep growing every time I visit. On my most recent pilgrimage, I tried the "full taco" (fish, shrimp, and a cheese-filled yellow hot pepper) and the "fish machaca taco" (steamed and shredded seasoned fish). Both were excellent.\n\nI\'ll admit it. I\'m addicted to these fish tacos and fries.

No texmex greasy steak fajitas here. Food inspured by fresh light flavors of Sonora. We were seduced by a flier for $5 off $20 or more purchase. This is highly creative chef owns his own place. We had the fish tacos, shrimp tacos, Fish Machaca, and the Gobernador Quesadillas. PRO TIP: These come as double tortillas loaded with meat only. You pile on your own fixens...and the cole slaw on fried fish tacos is divine! Loaded Fish and shrimp tacos were hand breaded and fried in house...NOT some crummy prebattered stuff. They are fresh and crunchy with deep mahogany batter, not crummy frozen panko. Three bucks a taco for fish, $3.50 for big shrimp. Huge..no way I am eating more than two. Machaca is like small succulent chunks of shrimp meat and veggies that had a unique flavor I could not put down. I ate the meat right out of the tortillia keaving the shell intact. It needed no salsa to fill your boca with sabor. Gobernador quesadillia is slightly sweet and creamy (not gooey) cheese with sweet gulf shrimp. It was my favorite and I put delicate tomatillo on it to enhance the sweet, delicate seafood flavor. We missed the Barbacoa...only so much made for the day...means we have to return tomorrow for lunch. Very yummy flavors. Best of show was roasted Jalepenos brined in soy sauce free on the salsa bar. My spouse ate 11 of them and I agreed that I had never had anything like that taste combination. This chef has a franchise explosion just waiting to make him a millionaire. Someone get this guy some angel investors so I can have his tacos at home in Chicago also! Suggestions? Get a be&sco mini press tortillia maker and make tortillias for us. Mmmm. Carve al pastor off a rotating spit for us. Wow...because you are a showman.

The house ranch is an addictive drug that enhances the taste of the already crispy fries.  The salsas, especially the extreme ones, are fantastic.  Add cabbage and chopped onions to finish things off and you'll maybe make it a week before returning for more fish taco heaven.\n\nI'm very happy Tempe has an unrivaled fish taco shop that I can take guests to from out of town.  TF will make a mark in every visitors' taste buds.\n\n*Tip 1*\nTempe residents should check their mail for TF coupons from time to time\n\n**Tip 2**\nIf you return to TF, check to see if the owner remembers you.  I bet he will!!\n\n***Tip 3***\nHalf price tacos from 3-6 PM and buy 2 get 1 free on Tuesdays.  Work off the gluttony by playing some video games at Gamestop next door.\n\n****Tip 4****\nTry to eat at the restaurant for your first visit.

I'm always up for trying new things, and a fish taco establishment is definitely new for me.  (I know, I'm deprived.)  I work with the owner's wife, so she suggested that I try it.  I decided to look up the place here, and I think it's a good thing if a place has been open for less than two years, has nearly 190 reviews and a rating of 4.5 stars.  That's quite an achievement because the first few years are the hardest for a business.  So I had to go.  After last night, I'm definitely going back.  Everything is made to order, and it's all homemade (try the ranch dressing with French fries - yum).  If you haven't been there before, the staff will let you know what the favorites are and how everything is prepared.  \n\nThe menu is small, but I think less is more.  If your menu is too large, then the quality can decrease.  Every bite is packed with delicious flavor.  You get the tacos, and dress them up however you want, so you're responsible if you make it too hot.  :)  Everything is made to order, so if you go during peak times, you can expect to wait a moment or two longer, but they are quick, so you're fine if you only have 30 minutes for lunch....or you could just call ahead so you won't have to inhale your food.  :)\n\nBest of all, this place is doing so well that they are going to open a second location soon in Mesa!  I'm so happy for these guys.  If you're in the mood for something new (if you've never had a fish taco), then definitely try this place.

I ordered a fish taco and the full taco.  I think it lacked flavor and it was soft and mushy, not crispy.  The salsa bar was just ok...lacked a lot of flavor as well.  The tarter sauce was pretty good, but that was all.  Like I said, it might have just been an off day, so I might try again in the future....based on the fact it seems like everyone loves it here.", 'business_id': 'RvosS7L1zBKFzLSYhCbiow', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2015-07-28', 'type': 'review'}

The place is clean and uncluttered, and the staff is ALWAYS very friendly and helpful.\n\nBut the food! Always fresh, made to order, and very tasty! I always order two tacos (and get one free on Tuesdays ) -- naked style, which means no tortilla. Then customize to my liking at the excellent salsa bar. Amazing flavor combinations are possible! Be sure to try the chipotle and the cilantro sauces.\n\nCheck out my photos for many examples of what can be created.

They have literally nothing that's served without onions unless you get it deep fried. They have shrimp and other not fried fish but it's in a funky looking congealed mix that included onions. \n\nHonestly, if I wasn't really hungry and in a hurry I would've left. Instead I ordered a quesadilla with fried shrimp. Not the healthy meal I was hoping for but...it is what it is. It was okay. Nothing rave worthy. \n\nThe girl taking orders was sick and cranky. Rather wish they had sent her home. I don't like sick people so close to my food. There was a younger guy that was refilling the salsa bar.
