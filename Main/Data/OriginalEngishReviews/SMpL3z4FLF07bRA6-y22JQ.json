It's been a couple of years since I've last been to Malee's but I'm certain that it was a romantic, dimly lit, comfortable quiet restaurant.  Something of a treat.  \n\nUnfortunately, this location didn't resemble Desert Ridge in the slightest. The dining room area to our left was fairly small, and noisy and well lit.  The atmosphere: rather casual.  My friends and I definitely felt out of place, and way overdressed for a Saturday night.   The tables felt crowded with plates and silverware already pre-served, which was kind of annoying because when our dishes came out, we were asked if we wanted to eat from the plate it came on, or if wanted to transfer our food onto the plates provided on the table.   Doesn't make sense.  We stuck with the plates the food was served on.  \n\nOn to the menu:  Another thing I seem to remember at the Desert Ridge Location, they offered Sushi.  There was no menu for Sushi at this location.  Was it that they just didn't provide a sushi menu unless asked for?  Or do they just don't serve it all?  I suppose, if they don't advertise it, it's probably best to just avoid the question all together.   Just a guess. \n\nI ordered the grilled chicken over spinach dish, mild.  Now this may or may not be worth noting, but I don't think my watch lapsed a full 5 minutes before we were served with our food.  This is wonderful, when you're at a fast food joint like Mc D's, but at a Thai restaurant?  I'm not so sure how I feel about that.  \n\nBy the way, Mild stands for : no kick to it at all.  Don't be scared to go with the medium.  Take it from someone who is a baby when it comes to hot spicey foods!\n\nOn to the great part: 3 dishes, 2 glasses of wine, 1 vodka Stoli: $62.00.

The manager is very professional, courteous and does an awesome job taking care of any mistake from the kitchen.\n\nif you want Thai in an atmosphere that's more upscale than traditional Thai restaurants, try Malee's. if you don't care and/or are a cheapskate like me, and/or desire more traditional Thai, try Thai Basil in Tempe.", 'business_id': 'SMpL3z4FLF07bRA6-y22JQ', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2008-07-16', 'type': 'review'}

I really enjoy Asian food in general (Sushi, Chinese & Vietnamese primarily), and I'm adventurous insomuch that I'll try anything at least twice (I'll give it the benefit of the doubt on the first time). With Malee's its funny, because each time I go there, I make an attempt to try something I haven't before, and it seems like in doing that, I find a new favorite each time. \n\nA smaller place in old-town Scottsdale, Malee's has a nice atmosphere that isn't too stuffy like 'traditional' Scottsdale, but not too trendy either. Their service is always amazing, and their people are always friendly. It's a place where being a regular is pretty easy because the staff will remember you after a couple of visits. \n\nMalee's makes it no secret that they're not going after the traditional Thai dishes, as they add their own flare and ingredients as they see fit. What's really great about this stance, is that they'll make the dishes how YOU see fit. I went in one time and ordered the Hippy Noodles (vegetarian), but since I'm a carnivore, and cannot have a meal without meat, I had them substitute Duck for the Tofu. It was delicious! You can order small portions, various degrees of spice (personally, I'm a wuss, so I keep things mild), substitutions, wine pairings, the whole nine. A truly unique dining experience in the way they approach their customers.\n\nI liked this place so much, and my girlfriend loves it more than I do even, that for her birthday, I got us in for one of their cooking classes they offer every month or two.  The owner, GM and head chef put on the class in one of the side dining areas, tought us the intricacies of their dishes (though most of the class was spent hearing the stories from customer tales, food-related trips around the world and other fun quips) and also what Malee's is about.  After the instructional portion (and several glasses of Champagne) we then moved to the bar-area and proceeded to partake in dining on the dishes we just learned about, with a fantastic wine-pairing put on by one of their bartenders.  Mind you, I thought that wine-pairing stuff was a load of hooey, but it really was fantastic.\n\nMalee's is fantastic, and I will continue to go there for as long as I can, and will miss if for the times that I cannot get there. If you like Thai, try it with an open mind. If you don't like Thai, try it with an open mind. If you're not picky, do yourself a favor and try it.", 'business_id': 'SMpL3z4FLF07bRA6-y22JQ', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2009-02-06', 'type': 'review'}

Our most recent Trip was on mother's Day, we saw Stomp and came out hungry around 4pm - we called and got in before the crowd w/no reservations and had yet another great meal. \n\nThe atmosphere is casual but nice and the emphasis is on the food. Malees is located on 5th Ave just west of Scottsdale and has a TON of street parking available as most of galleries that surround it are closed at dinner time anyway. They also serve lunch, man I need to go there more often! Favorite Standout dishes include the traditional soups, Thai Stick appetizers, the best fried tofu in town with peanut dipping sauce (a really simple dish that's apparently easy to f*ck up based on what I've had elsewhere), beef panang (not on the menu so just order it), of course pad-thai and a dish I think they call candied fish that is two HUGE whitefish fillets that are very lightly breaded and flash fried and drizzled with a sweet chilie sauce, to call it sweet and sour would be insulting, way better and more nuanced. They have anice little patio when weather permits, can take parties from 2 to 8 with no problem and take and actually KEEP reservations. (Am I the only one who gets pissed if he makes a reservation, shows up on the dot and waits an hour?) Crowd is mixed and widely varied from new age sandal-foots exploring the East by eating noodles to tourists, locals, first dates, and of course the usual assortment of Indian and Asian families that lets you know they know how to use spices.

The tables that crowd the tiny space make the environment seem too cramped, and an intimate night out might be shared with the couple at the table next to you.\nSit at the bar, where you are always waited on promptly, the bar tenders are quite knowledgeable, have time to discuss the art of being alive, and can whip up some delectable treats before you receive your fare.  My personal favorite beverage is the Thai Iced Tea.  Though non-alcohlic, it is delicious and complements any of the foods well. Ask the bartenders or servers about the wine list, often they carry imported beer from Italy as well.\nI will start by saying I have not tasted everything on the menu,  but i do know what i will order again and again. \nIf you are new to Thai food, an absolute must is the "Tom Ka Gai" soup.  A serving ideal for a party of three, it is a divine hot and sour interpretation with coconut milk, mushrooms, cilantro, lemongrass, galangal root, and kaffir lime.  It can be ordered with any meats, tofu, or just plain.  I recommend it with all white chicken, and at a number 2.  If you are unsure about how spicy you want your Thai food, remember that 1 is not spicy, and 5 (the highest) will probably burn offyour taste buds.  Perhaps you like spicy, but also note that too much spice will overpower the complexity of your foods.\nIf you want an assortment of various appetizers, try the Combination plate which includes Spring rolls, Satay, (marinated chicken tenders with cucumber and peanut sauces, and my favorite!) Thai Toast, (flash fried toast points filled with garlic and chicken, not my favorite) Crab Rangoon, (delicious flash-fried puffs of crab and cream cheese served with thai sauces) Siamese Kisses,  (chicken and shrimp in steamed shumai wraps topped with scallions and crispy garlic) and Potstickers.  \nAll come with an assortment of sauces, and if your eyes are larger than your belly, then you will likely have no room left for the divine main courses.\nQuite frankly, I have never tried any of the house favorites, except the Pad Thai.  And if Pad Thai is all you know, I recommend you venture out this time and wrap your lips around some of the sweetest, most delicious curries this side of the West\nI am not a fan of vegetables, which is something one finds an overabundance of in Thai dishes...but not if you order the "Burma Gai."  Flat noodles and chicken in a yellow curry with coconut milk with titillate and tantalize.  You can substitute, add, or remove anything in any one of the entrees, so you can basically customize your entrees.\nIf you like something with a little more pizazz, do the "Drunken Dragon Noodles" or "The Evil Jungle Princess."  Another curry dish, the Dragon, has rice noodles smothered with a wild green curry sauce, topped with chicken, basil, and onion. Again, if you are not a fan of the spicy, go very easy on this one.  Better yet is the Princess, which has a lovely coconut sauce with hints of mint, and two simple additions of chicken and straw mushrooms.  Though I prefer chicken or nothing at all, the Green Basil Curry with Pork is another incredible curry with coconut and various veggies.\nYou will also have a selection of seafood dishes, as well as specialty sushi rolls and vegetarian preparations.  Remember that the sauces here are the key, all dishes are served with rice, all ingredients can be removed or substituted, and if you really want to taste the diverse flavors, don\'t make your dish too spicy.\nDon\'t be shy to ask, as all the waitstaff here is very knowledgable, and even if you are new to Thai, or a veteran, they can assist you in making the perfect choice.\nShould you have room for dessert at the end of your robust meal, a must is the traditional Thai favorite, Sticky Coconut Rice with fresh mangos. Not heavy enough to warrant a wheelbarrow for the ride home, but sticky and sweet enough to make you feel like a kid again.\nIn short, I love this place!  And I have to come here at least once a month just for the soup and the great conversation with the bartenders.', 'business_id': 'SMpL3z4FLF07bRA6-y22JQ', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2009-05-28', 'type': 'review'}

The four of us decided on Thai & our friend that was driving mentioned Malee\'s.  We all agreed to give it a try after we realized that the other mentioned options were closed on Sunday evening.\n\nTo start, Malee\'s atmosphere was not bad.  The dinning room was clean (or seemed so) & was well decorated for a Thai restaurant.  The service was marginal...  Our server proceeded to explain all of the specials, all of which he pretty much said were not good.  Pretty strange, but I always appreciate the honesty, but needless to say, we ordered off of their regular menu.\n\nThe food...  The food was OK, nothing special.  I absolutely LOVE great Thai food, however, this was not much better than what you would be served at a Chinese restaurant.  Presentation was great, but the food was missing the real Thai flavors & covered with tons of sodium-rich sauce & oil.\n\nFor those of you who rave about this place, try Thai Lahna or Thai Rama for excellent authentic Thai cuisine.\n\nBack to the COCKROACHES IN THE FOOD!!!\n\nAfter the four of us had our first serving of food with rice, I went in for another serving of rice from the community bowl to try my partners dish.  Amongst the rice was a "friend" looking up at me, a COCKROACH.  Although I am vegetarian, the fact that an animal was in the rice did not freak me out.  Cockroaches, however are not a sign of cleanliness in a restaurant.  I already had my concerns after visiting the restroom to wash my hands before dinner, what a freaking mess!  But that\'s another show...\n\nAfter finding the cockroach in the rice, I brought this to the server\'s attention, trying not to make a scene & upset my friends who had all already eaten from the rice bowl.  I requested a fresh bowl of rice & explained the problem.  He saw it & agreed to bring a new bowl, which he did shortly thereafter.  \n\nOne big problem that I have with Malee\'s is that we did not receive any sort of apology for being served a COCKROACH in our rice.  I was not looking for a free dinner, but an apology was in order for such a disgusting situation from both the server & a manager/owner would have been nice.

The restaurant is both venerable and hip enough to comfortably pass as Scottsdale "special occasion" - without breaking the bank.  \n\nIs it as uniformly "special" as the finest resort dining room. No. Nobody here is going to fold your napkin into a swan and there\'s no focal Dale Chihuly wine rack or glorious mountain view. But if you play it smart, a memorable and exotic meal can be had in a charming locale.  \n\nHere\'s my advice, lemongrasshopper:   \n\nMake a dinner reservation. Table location and service are better when you do.  True most places, but moreso here .  \n\nGet the pot of soup.  Tom Ka Gai is a warming, communal ritual and helps smooth over slow Fri & Sat nite service.  \n\nSolicit server recommendations. Most of the menu resonates and Malee\'s tailors spice level to individual tastes well, but some dishes are consistently better than others.  \n\nDo all that, and I\'m pretty sure you\'ll have a nice experience. Walk in cold, take a blind stab at the menu, and you\'re apt to be less impressed. \n\nI like the atmosphere, especially in the main dining room. It\'s an older building, with low ceilings and residential style rooms. Dimly lit, but not clubby and masculine like Don & Charlies. An unseen piano gently tinkles in the background.  Older couples, younger out of towners, packs of gay foodies, the occasional family celebrating a birthday.  A pleasant, bustling mix.  \n\nThere are art galleries and holiday lights on Main Street (which is more of a  quiet side street at night) and plenty of parking at dinner time.

We are both fans of ginger and this was a really  nice, light dish to follow a mostly fried-foods appetizer.  The capers added flavor that was nice against the earthy/meatyness of the mushroom.  Coconut ice cream to share for dessert was perfect.  \nOh! I almost forgot to talk about the beverages!  I had the Mai Thai, which was delicious as far as Mai Tais go. The bf got the Thai Cosmo...

The way this dish was made lacked all of those 3 features but the sustitution by the ripe mangos solved that issue and gave it the flavor that it need. By design, I expected that was the intention of this Americanized dish: the individual ingredients thrown in separately and not blended in until it softened, stripped away the traditional spice and saucy elemental aspects of it and you  have something different for a change that the mostly non-minority American diners would enjoy. The papaya salad is usually regarded as an appetizer; a feminine dish usually made by a female(it is also blasphemous for a male cook to make it, and I don\'t want to know).

The pad thai is reminescent of a take out of the "Panda Place", not bad but not special.\n\nOverall, by design -Americanized Thai, that attempts to tone done the flavors of the dish and the way ingredients are prepared , it creates a different twist on traditional dishes.  It had to because , for example, you can\'t throw preserve fish sauce into these dishes like you would in an authentic Thai restaurant that would fume the whole place.

Parking may be a walk since you are in old town Scottsdale.\n\nBased on individual preference , looking at the food alone, this would not be a place I would repeatedly come; it does not provide traditional flavors in the sense that Lao Thai or Thai Esan or Thai Hut does for the same price and nor does it expect one to follow traditional eating ettiquette that is an essence of food from this region.

Here\'s why...  I last visited Malee\'s for a business lunch with a client.  He is very familiar with Thai food, so he knew exactly what he wanted from the menu and ordered it with "medium" spiciness (also called 2 stars).  We had the salad first, which my client said was good, but not excellent.  Upon trying his meal, however, he said the food was too spicy to even enjoy...far beyond "medium."  It was so spicy he actually would not eat another bite.  The server kindly offered to bring him a different item on the menu, which he accepted, but I felt the damage was already done.  I had recommended this restaurant, and it was a disappointment to my client.  Then, after my client\'s new meal was delivered, it became very difficult to get our server\'s attention again.\n\nIn the future, I would just keep in mind that Malee\'s dishes are served spicier than you might normally expect, and then hopefully avoid the experience I had last week.', 'business_id': 'SMpL3z4FLF07bRA6-y22JQ', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2010-09-21', 'type': 'review'}

They were out of cold saki, so I ordered a saki martini; it was interesting; I had two so I guess I can't complain too much. I ordered the Red Vegetable curry with Tofu for my entr\xe9e; it was pretty good, actually tasted better left over the next day.

After several days of eating Italian and American food, we decided to go "Asian" and chose Malee\'s based on the high average Yelp rating.\n\nMy first impression was good.  The restaurant has a nice ambiance and the service is pretty good.  But I was shocked when I saw the menu.   The prices are outrageous.  It ended up costing $62 for 3 people.  I\'m pretty sure I could\'ve gotten the same amount of food for half the price at any Thai restaurant in LA.\n\nWe ordered Crab Rangoon, Tom Ga Kai soup, Calamari salad, and Roasted Duck Curry.  The Crab Rangoon lacked crab and the sauce did not go well with the fried dumpling.  One of my pet peeves is when a restaurant defaults to white meat chicken without asking me for my opinion. News Flash! There are many of us out there who prefer the juiciness and tenderness of dark meat chicken.  Anyway, the Tom Ga Kai had all white meat chicken and it tasted dry and flavorless. Furthermore, the soup was too thick and was more like a stew.  The soup base itself was far too sweet.  I order this soup at every Thai restaurant I go to so I think I\'ve had it enough times to be able to say that this one was the worst.   I am also a huge fan of Roasted Duck Curry and this was the worst Roasted Duck Curry I\'ve had at a Thai restaurant anywhere.

The price is a bit hefty for a Thai restaurant.  It reminds me of PF Chang for Chinese food.\n\nWe had the soft shell crab for the appetizer and the duck curry and the coco chili fish for the main course.  The soft shell crab is made from a whole soft shell crab including the shell attached and tempera battered which made the crab very crunchy.  Every part of the crab was edible.  The mixture of the crunchy tempera batter and the sweet tangy cucumber mae ploy sauce was delectable.  The duck from the duck curry dish was so tender that it tasted like butter. The red curry had pineapple in it. I ordered a 4 for the duck curry, but it wasn't as spicy as some of the other Thai places were.  So if you like HOT food, then be sure to ask for 5+.  The coco chili fish is a battered white fish deep fried covered in a peanut sauce.  It was one of their signature dishes.  I enjoyed the flavoring of the fish.  The batter absorbed the sauce very well that created a unique combination.

The atmosphere is much nicer than many other Thai restaurants that I\'ve been to and the curry can\'t be beaten.  My favorite is the Arizona Heatwave, which I typically order "very spicy" with tofu.  To translate, "very spicy" at Malee\'s means that there\'s good flavor and spice for someone who typically likes spicier food without being so overpowering that one\'s mouth is simply burning so badly that the actual flavors of the food are masked.  The dinner portion is definitely quite a bit larger than the lunch portion, so if you\'re looking to take leftovers home, you\'ll want the larger size.  The tofu spinach pot stickers are also a great appetizer and are served with a variety of tasty dipping sauces.  The only real negative that I\'ve encountered food-wise is the peanut dressing that comes on the salads by default.  It\'s so heavy and the salad is just drowning in dressing to the point that it\'s impossible to taste the salad itself.  That problem is easily remedied, however, by asking for the sesame ginger dressing which is much lighter.\n\nWhile I\'ve never attended, Malee\'s offers cooking classes once a month at which they provide instruction on how to make some of their signature dishes.  It sounds like fun, but my logic is why go through the trouble of cooking the food myself when I can just go to Malee\'s and have a great meal while someone else does the work!', 'business_id': 'SMpL3z4FLF07bRA6-y22JQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2011-06-30', 'type': 'review'}

Most importantly they gave me information on how to cook my own Thai vegetarian cuisine, and the best places in town to find the ingredients. During the class they take you through about 5 recipes, and then provide sampling for the dishes as you go.   After the class you sit down for a full meal of the items presented in the class, along with wine pairing.  It was such a great experience, because I was able to try several dishes at once.

The Pad Thai was flavorful, the Bombay Curry was an assortment of veggies in a creamy yellow curry and the Chicken Panang was chicken in a kaffir lime curry with carrots and bell peppers.\n\nRead the entire review here...http://schmoozeaz.com/blog/?p=787", 'business_id': 'SMpL3z4FLF07bRA6-y22JQ', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2012-07-10', 'type': 'review'}

The meat was savory and seasoned well and my portion was so big, there was no finishing it.\nMy bro\'s seafood curry was a hefty portion (as were all the rest of the dishes in our party) but I wasn\'t a big fan of the flavor.\nMy hubby\'s spare ribs were overly-flavored (yes, that does exist) and I didn\'t enjoy the bite I had.\n\nIm not sure how authentic this Thai food is, but it was tasty... Thai food is quite healthy (yes, I do believe coconut fats are healthy), but all the sugar added for flavor enhancement of the currys is not very Thai.. nor appealing to me.

Drinks came at a standard pace and the soup we all shared initially was decent though a little thick and cheaper meat in terms of the chicken.  Entrees were a little slow to come out but not bad for a Friday night when the place was packed.  I had left it up to the waitress as to my personal order as she seemed quite knowledgeable.  Just wanted 'light and spicy.'  I eat everything so not a tall order.  Others in the group were easy as well and ordered a few specials off the menu.  My entree was an incredibly oily dish with minimal spice and some 'light' lettuce pieces on the side. Very cheap cuts of chicken, relying on oil and grease for flavor.  Everyone else also got an oily basic Americanized perversion of Thai food as well.  Totally basic and without any sort of creativity.  If you like the subpar stuff they serve at PF Chang's you won't be disappointed.  If you have ever been to a solid true Thai restaurant anywhere else in the country that isn't chain-affiliated, stay home.  I have sent maybe 5 plates back in my adult life.  I sent this back and the waitress just took it and walked off.  No 'hey would you like something else' or 'perhaps I can get the chef to come out and recommend another dish?' Nothing.  Just left and took it off the bill.  Phoenicians we need to demand better.  Our restaurants are just abysmal in terms of food in comparison to every major metropolitan area of comparable size.

No pix of the King and Queen, which normally would have caused me to turn around and leave, but we were starving. My companion merely wanted some Khao Pat Thai (Thai fried rice), but they didn\'t have it on the menu and couldn\'t make it.  Really, you cannot make a basic staple dish of Thailand? So he ordered Paad Thai, another staple, which should\'ve been simple-but what he got didn\'t even resemble  Paad Thai, it looked like some messy noodle dish doused in BBQ sauce. How can you mess up Paad Thai?  Makes me think the cook isn\'t Thai.\n\nI had duck noodle soup, which actually was quite good, so no complaints there and can recommend it.\n\nFor some reason we were served brown rice, not jasmine rice, odd.\n\nAlso ordered the summer rolls, which primarily consisted of dry rice noodles, very very bland and I don\'t recommend.\n\nOverall a negative review...never had to give a Thai place a bad review...but this is not a particularly "Thai" place.\n\n\nCompanion\'s comments:  \nRecommended by employees of a local Asian grocery store so thought it should be decent. First indicator of bad was no picture of the Thai king in the restaurant.  I have been in Thailand and have expectations when I eat Thai food.  The  Pad Thai I had had a BBQ flavor and look to it.  By far the worst Thai food I have had. I would have done better getting an instant Thai meal at the grocery store.  The service was lame, I had to ask for a refill of water to down the BBQ flavored peppers. The waiter never came back except for the check. The bus boy paid more attention to the guests table than the waiter.\n\nIf you  are looking for the regulars found in a Thai menu, you will see a bastardized version thus westernizing the food and not particularly authentic.', 'business_id': 'SMpL3z4FLF07bRA6-y22JQ', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2013-03-09', 'type': 'review'}

I LOVE Thai food, I would eat it every night if I could. I\'ve been trying every Thai joint within 20 miles of my new abode, trying to find something comparable to the authentic Thai I got in Anthem (of all places). Malees was the worst strike-out of them all.\n\nMy first clue should have been when the girl asked "How spicy?"  I replied with "3", as every Thai restaurant I\'ve been to does a scale of 1 to 5.  She responded with an awkward silence and then "... So really hot?"   No... no... just no. \n\nWe had the appetizer platter, which was 6 different things that all tasted the same, save for the crab rangoons, the crispy pla and the evil jungle princess. The fish candy was blah. The crispy pla, as someone already mentioned in another review, tasted like nothing whatsoever, and the sauce was overly sweet; I thought I\'d need an insulin shot after 2 bites. The evil jungle princess is one of my favorite dishes, but this one was just not right. It was like they had dumped chili powder into it. Chili powder does not go in Thai food. Do not want. It did NOT mix in with the curry and just burned the s*** out of my tongue. The rice was also very dry.\n\nThe bill for this "Oh let\'s just get Thai takeout" evening came out to $49. $49 for freaking take-out for 2 people. I was kind of shell-shocked; I had added it up at home and it shouldn\'t have been that much.... but me not wanting to cause a scene, I just paid it. I don\'t know if they accidentally did "large" portions, but they looked normal sized to me. \nBut Jesus Christ, I can pay $25 for two people and get amaaaazing Thai food, so $49 for this lame excuse for Thai was not acceptable. Yes, I realize this is Scottsdale, and I am used to paying more for everything, but this was a whole new level...

I had the creme brulee for dessert, which was excellent.\n\nI would give this place five stars except that my food was a little too spicy.  They ask you at the beginning how spicy you want your food on a scale of 1-5, and I asked for a 3, which the waitress said was a very tolerable level.  I was expecting a moderately spicy meal, but it turned out to be a little more than that.  I had to take a sip of water after every bite, and my sinuses were about to fire up.  I was on a date so I figured it would be better to eat less food rather than fight through the spiciness and have watery eyes and a runny nose.  Not attractive.  \n\nThe whole street is full of art galleries, and it would have been really nice to have been able to walk down the street and browse through them after dinner, but everything on the street closes a little early.  \n\nOverall, this was a really good experience.

I live in the far southeast Valley now and rarely come out to Snottsdale anymore. My wife and I did a staycation at a local resort and we decided to come into here and really glad we did. It seems to be a lost art these days our servers that give a crap about their trade and are knowledgeable about the product that they serve. Our server was a delightful gal who knew the menu inside and out and instead of just taking an order was a menu guider.\n\nWe started with the puh-puh platter that they call "the taste of Thai" it was an excellent selection at $14. It had spring rolls, chicken satay, crab Rangoon, potstickers etc. they came with all of these really cool sauces to. Loved it.\n\nMy wife rather picky about what she eats usually sticks to the main staples especially when it comes to Asian food. She ordered a Mandarin chicken and as soon as they put it down I could see that she wasn\'t going to like it as she eats a lot with her eyes and not her mouth. Sure enough she tried it and didn\'t like it is that orange peel gives off kind of a burnt taste. That\'s all her and her pickiness because I tried it and I thought it was fantastic don\'t judge her lack of taste. The server is gracious enough to bring her a replacement plate of teriyaki chicken. They put a rush on the order came out rather quickly and that chicken was absolutely out of this world. It was cooked crispy perfectly and seasoned wonderfully. She said it was the best teriyaki chicken she\'s ever had. I agree with her.\n\nI had a seafood curry that had scallops and shrimp, call Mari, muscles and fish it was served in a spicy red curry sauce. Server asked me on a scale of 1 to 5 about the heat index and I said a three. Three is hot so be forewarned as I was sweating to the oldies eating that dish. The curry flavor was exceptional.\n\nWe also had a bowl of chicken wonton soup that had I think was spinach in it but also these incredibly good chicken dumplings. The ingredients are really good however the broth needed salt. \n\nI love this place can\'t wait to go again!', 'business_id': 'SMpL3z4FLF07bRA6-y22JQ', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2014-07-01', 'type': 'review'}

Pad Thai - the sauce had a weird flavor that was not authentic to the phad Thai at all. I was confused eating it lol\n\n3. Pad Kee Mao (Drunken noodles) - this is my fav noodle dish of all time. Been eating it my entire life. This was the most disappointing dish we ordered. They used pad thai noodles for the dish, and the flavoring was so off.

Nothing about it was Thai. \n\nOverall, the restaurant was clean and had nice staff. However, the food is not quite Thai food. It's Americanized Asian food, that caters to the palettes of those who doesn't know authentic Thai food. Maybe I'm biased because I'm part Thai and grew up eating the real stuff all my life. But I've also had amazing Thai food all over America. The best Thai food is of course in Los Angeles Thai town. Even San Fran, NY, NC, and Portland are few cities that has my fav Thai restaurants. \n\nPersonally, today for me, I just consumed wasted calories lol. I'm still craving my drunken noodles!

Crab rangoon, beef and broccoli, curry ribs, seafood curry, pad thai, and more. Everything that I could eat was very good.  I really loved those ribs and the seafood curry.  The c-food curry was the most expensive at $18.99 while everything else clocked in around $12.00 - $17.00 (ok, the crab rangoon was $8.99 which I consider expensive considering how cheap it is at Chinese take out joints).\n\nWith that many plates and people the meal was expensive at $152.80 but we all left full.  My only complaint with them was that it's Scottsdale! It was summer time!

Good not great in this Yelper's opinion, but you'll find some quality dishes in a contemporary atmosphere.\n\nMy Overall Rating - 3 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food, Return)\n\nAtmosphere - Malee's Thai Bistro has two dining areas.  You'll find a main room and another that accompanies the bar.  On our weekday visit, it was busy, full of energy, and had a nice vibe.  We sat in the room with the bar and it had a nice mural of Southeast Asia on the wall.  1 Star.\n\nService - Our server was very friendly and helpful.  We did have a problem with one of our dishes (see below) and while she wasn't available during the meal for us to address it, she did have it removed from the bill.  Kudos for that but I would have liked a check in so we could have addressed it earlier.   1/2 Star.\n\nFood - Crispy Basil Chicken - order it.  It's the best item.  You'll get tender, well-seasoned chicken that you can pair with rice or any other noodle dish.  It's slightly sweet with a hint of basil.  We also enjoyed the calamari salad, although it really didn't seem like a Thai dish.  I guess it felt like it was a more American dish vs. Thai, but I was good.  Our Pad Thai was ok - nothing great but nothing bad.  Our one item that was really off was the Pad Woon Sen.  I love this dish - as it has thin glass mung bean noodles, scallions, and egg (main ingredients).  Our dish, however, had a hint of kerosene smell.  As we ate it, something didn't seem right.  We tried to flag down our server but she didn't come back until we were finishing up.  Now, they did remove it from the bill, but it would have been nice to of had the option to replace it instead. 1 Star.\n\nWill I Return? - Maybe.  Aside from the Pad Woon Sen, our meal was good.  Now, I think the menu has a lot of American influences, but there seems to be enough to warrant a return.   1/2 Star.\n\nMy Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts):\n1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm.\n1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point.\n2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food.\n1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return. \n\nEach Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.  I will sum them up to provide my final Yelp score.", 'business_id': 'SMpL3z4FLF07bRA6-y22JQ', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2014-12-02', 'type': 'review'}

I would have said this was one of my favorite places before we dined here on the 17th.\n\nI work in the industry and this was a bad experience for the books, and I try to always stay positive and give great reviews when they are due! I am writing this in hopes the owner will see and make a change to their service.\n\nUnless the meal was on the house, I do not know that I will go back again.\n\nWe made a reservation for a larger party (10 people) to celebrate my sisters birthday on Sat evening. I sat a little later than everyone because I was working late, but when I got there I had a hard time getting our servers attention to get a menu or order a drink. Once I had menu I kept having to flag her down over & over to try and order a drink.\n\nEveryone ordered, I ordered 2 dishes. Food came out. I bit into my spring roll that was supposed to be vegetarian (vegetarian for 13+ years) and ate a bite of shrimp- bleh! Everyone else continued eating. Asked for my server, tried to get her attention, nothing was working. She was really hard to get ahold of the entire time we were there. Wasn\'t checking back on drinks or on food. I just wanted a menu to order something different and once I got that, same process to try and place a new order and get her attention. The restaurant is also not full. Meanwhile two people at the table noticed they didn\'t get both entrees they ordered. She didn\'t notice that either. We had to try to flag her down again to let her know that and to cancel the rest of their orders. By that time, everyone was so far along eating. I had ordered a curry. Never came out. She never even noticed and I couldn\'t get her attention to tell her. Very frustrating.\n\nThen came the checks. This is what REALLY ruined our entire experience. The restaurant was closing around us and we were the last table left in this place well after close still with open checks.\n\nShe came around to do some split checks and wrote everything down and completely skipped my side of the table and me AGAIN so I still couldn\'t tell her that my food never came out/that I didn\'t want to be charged for it.\n\n10..20.. minutes go by. Still do not have our checks. The manager (didn\'t know was the Manager at the time) walks by and we ask him to check on our bills and he says "Well, it takes a WHILE" very rudely and walks away. We FINALLY get them and mine has the shrimp roll on it I sent back and the curry that I never received. She drops the check and disappears again. I have to get up go all the way to her standing at the computer and tell her I never got my food, both that and the shrimp roll are on my bill. She is overwhelmed, not friendly, and obviously completely frustrated at this point. She proceeded to say "oh my god...they never dropped it off to you..?!" etc... blaming everyone else. I just said I wanted it off my bill.\n\n10...20...25...minutes go by. She has not brought back any of our checks. Our party is getting very upset. We were on our way out to go celebrate a birthday! And we are just waiting around to pay for a crummy dinner experience. People are considering walking out. Half the party goes and waits outside. So I get up and go to the bar computer where she is standing & her Manager is standing in the bar facing her YELLING at her even as I walk up and say "excuse me", and that I needed to speak to her. I was polite at first saying we have been waiting a very long time to close out our checks and we really need to be on our way... I get cut off by him saying "Yeah well it takes a long time" they are "working on it" again and is extremely rude to me immediately. I ask to speak to the manager. He says he is the "closing manager and the only manager here right now" And I told him I felt it was very inappropriate for him to continue yelling at our server about the checks open on the screen as I stand here and if she cannot do it if he could please just close out our checks and show her how to do it after we leave. \n\nI was shocked at how rude he was and continued to be. He never said he wold take care of anything or apologized. As I said I work in the industry and would never even consider speaking to a guest that way for any reason. To make this even more upsetting and embarrassing he is yelling at the server and speaking to me so rudely while his BOH staff is standing around the bar watching bc they are closed. She finally brings our checks, CRYING.\n\nWe were charged for everything. No discount. No apology. No check drop off or a thank you from the Manager. This is one of the absolute worst experiences I have ever had at a restaurant.\n\nPlease fix this experience Malees, I have loved your food for years. Very disappointed.', 'business_id': 'SMpL3z4FLF07bRA6-y22JQ', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2015-01-26', 'type': 'review'}

Its a quiet little bar which is exactly what I need sometimes. \nI\'ve been there a few times. So far I\'ve tried the fried catfish, the tom ka gai soup, wonton soup, spring rolls and shumai dumplings. \nEverything is good. ... just not great. Not four stars in my opinion at least. The only thing that should come with a "no!!" warning are the shumai dumplings.... They are just over-the-top with garlic. Its literally like eating a clove whole. The Tom Ka Gai soup is very very very good, and loaded with enough chicken for that to be the whole meal if you\'re eating light. This is a five-star soup, as is their wonton soup. Fried catfish is good, generous portion and not overly battered. Spring rolls are weak. Sure...they\'re spring rolls, I guess you can\'t expect too much but at same time they\'re not too difficult to do well either. \nAll in all...quaint spot, great service, but food is just okay. I\'m willing to give it another shot .... probably more out of convenience than anything else though.', 'business_id': 'SMpL3z4FLF07bRA6-y22JQ', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2015-02-01', 'type': 'review'}

Malee's was three minutes away, so we zipped over there and were seated immediately on a VERY busy Monday night. \nThe service is incredible there. Even though the place was packed (and very noisy, due to the presence of a party of 14 seated just next to us), the wait staff and bussers were right on everything. As a former waiter (10 years in excellent restaurants in San Diego), I am generally pretty attuned to quality service. These people were obviously very well-trained; it was very impressive to see their coordination and cooperation with each other. \nBut, there is a reason I mentioned the service first. It's five star service, but unfortunately the food does not live up to that billing. My girlfriend and I love Thai, and we try to find a good Thai place whenever we travel. It's hard to find anything as good as Lanna Thai in Pacific Beach (San Diego), and this was no exception. \nWe got their veggie rolls for starters, and those came with a Plum Poison sauce that was very good. Unfortunately, it could not rescue the amazingly bland (though very fresh) rolls, which lacked any flavor despite the fresh ingredients. Our assessment was that fresh rolls without mint or cilantro or basil or SOMETHING are just rice noodles with no flavor. (again- if you want the best, go to Lanna Thai for these!)\nWe had a Pad noodle dish that was also fairly disappointing. The only food item that was the least bit impressive was the yellow curry veggies. \n\nLastly, a word of advice. If you're going to dine there in the winter (we ate there on February 23), take some warm clothing. The place was FREEZING. We could not wait to get out of there- only due to that one factor. The ambiance is really good- there was live music playing in the other room. But if you don't make the temperature of the restaurant accommodating, people will be shivering while they try to enjoy the cuisine. \n\nThat's all.", 'business_id': 'SMpL3z4FLF07bRA6-y22JQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2015-02-23', 'type': 'review'}

I expected much more from a restaurant on Main Street in Scottsdale. I ordered fried spring rolls, panang curry chicken, pad Thai, and chicken fried rice. I spent two years in Thailand and seek out Thai restaurants across the US. Thai is my favorite food and nothing at this restaurant tasted as I would have expected. \n\nThe spring rolls were like over-cooked egg rolls filled with nothing but noodles, and I couldn't believe they were served with sweet and sour sauce. I have never been to a Thai restaurant that served anything but sweet chili/peanut sauce with their spring rolls. \n\nThe panang curry was alright, but I love being able to taste the panang and coconut milk flavors, this I couldn't, it seemed more like gravy than a curry. The white rice that accompanied it was sticky, but to the point of a paste. I was expecting some light jasmine rice, a rice often served in Thai restaurants, but I can't imagine that this was. This was the same used in the fried rice, there were clumps of matted flavorless rice all the way through. The dish itself had plenty of vegetables but no flavor and it didn't seem like much egg either. To me it was more of a rice stir fry with unseasoned and over-cooked chicken. (The only reason I ordered fried rice in a Thai restaurant is for my son).\n\nThe pad Thai tasted as though it came out of a pre-packaged, store-bought pad Thai kit rather than a restaurant, the flavor being off and the noodles completely over cooked. It was a salty dish, when it should be slightly sweet, like the balance between the tamarind juice, palm sugar, and fish sauce was wrong, if the traditional ingredients were even used. \n\nUnfortunately I can't speak to the quality of the restaurant or the service because I took the order to go, but based on the taste of the food I will never return.", 'business_id': 'SMpL3z4FLF07bRA6-y22JQ', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2015-08-05', 'type': 'review'}

We ordered a bottle of wine and went for it.  I ordered their Crispy Pla (A.K.A Fish Candy).  They have other dishes that I love like the Crispy Basil Chicken; bite sized chicken glazed with a tamarind chili sauce, and Drunken Dragon Noodles; rice noodles and chicken tossed with basil and bean sprouts and lightly green curry sauce.  Everyone around the table wasn't sure about my order because of the name, but as dishes were being passed around my dish was becoming the star of the night.  Crispy fried fish drizzled with sweet and spicy pickled jalapeno garlic sauce on a bed of cabbage.  The sauce really was the star since I'm sure you could put in on chicken, beef, or pork and it would still be a great dish.\n\nI love Malee's for their traditional take on Thai food, but also the ability to fuse an American style to enhance it's food.

The Pad Thai for him with tons of protein and the Panang Curry for me with tons of Vegetables, both ordered spicy.  This is the second time we went and will be back again.\n\n    I was compelled to write this because it was THE BEST Chicken Panang curry I have ever tasted. It had a smooth tomato base that you could only taste a hint of the tomato it was absolutely creamy, divine, and flavorful. I was going to have to poke his hand if he kept taking it because I wanted it all for myself.  So good that I told the waitress that she had to tell the chef compliments. It opened up my husbands stuffy nose, but the spice was not so strong you couldn\'t taste the delicious flavors.  If you have ever been turned off by a yellow curry and said curry is not for me, Please give this dish a try. Again, the best I have ever eaten in 3 states that I have lived in.\n\n  Unfortunately we are not impressed with the Pad Thai.  The only way we can describe it is that somehow they Americanized it.  Not very flavorful and the noodles always are stuck together. If you put your fork in it, it will lift the whole plate almost.  We had to order bean sprouts which usually come with a pad Thai and felt like it was missing the peanuts or eggs or both. Next time, we are going to try the Drunken Noodles, and I can\'t wait to!\n\n  I give 2 thumbs up even though the pad Thai wasn\'t the best, overall the service was great, and so was the food.

We started with a pot of Tom Ka Gai and as always it was outstanding and had enough to take home (SCORE). I ordered the Coco Chili Fish and my boyfriend ordered the Crispy Teriyaki Chicken. We also had brown rice as well. My dish was cooked perfectly. The dish is so filling so I had two more meals for leftovers and my boyfriend liked his but it wasn't his favorite. The chicken was a tad tough for him but still really good. Service was great and food was delicious.

The Drunken Noodles were my least favorite because they use ground chicken rather than chicken breast. I didn\'t read the menu well enough because that is written, although the flavor was excellent. The "Chinese sausage" in the Jalapeno fried rice is amazing. I don\'t know how or what it is made with, but it is awesome!.
