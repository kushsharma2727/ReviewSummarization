Todd's happens to be my favorite Las Vegas restaurant so we make it a point to visit on each trip.  Our karma was good this evening as we were assigned to one of Sheena's tables.  She appeared to be suitably impressed when I unveiled our bottle of Tunnel of Elms that sported a plastic cork.  We allowed her to recite the daily specials, but our minds were made up beforehand.  We shared a baby spoonleaf spinach salad with cranberries, goat cheese and candied walnuts tossed with a warm bacon dressing that was nothing short of sublime.  Our entrees were teriyaki halibut served over steamed rice and baby bok choy.  I have ordered this entre at least 5 times in the past and it has never been anything short of exceptional and I don't even like teriyaki.  Todd, owner/chef extraordinaire, stopped by the table and thanked us for our support.    Meanwhile Sheena managed to keep our glasses filled while also attending to several other tables including a large party of 10.

The pan seared day boat scallops with pistachio and brown butter were also amazing, perfectly cooked, tender and sweet.

It might be a bit soon to make this call, but I am going to go out on a limb and declare it to be my overall favorite off-strip restaurant in Vegas.  Blows away Rosemary's.\n\nTodd serves creative, well executed, high-quality food made with fresh seasonal ingredients combining both subtle and bold flavors,  I suppose some might say there is Asian influence, but I consider it to be West Coast American Nouveau.  I must admit, however, that this review might be slightly biased because it is soft shell crab season and I am sort of a soft shell crab whore.  \n\nBesides the juicy, succulent, makes-my-mouth-water-just-thinking-about-it soft shell crab, everything I've had there has been surprisingly good.  On a couple occasions I've even caught myself chuckling out loud about an unexpected twist or an extra added touch which took the dish to the next level.  \n\nOne example would be the time I ordered what the menu that day called surf and turf - day boat scallops and tournedos of beef .  I ordered scallops rare and they were prepared exactly how I like them.  The tenderloin was well cooked, properly seasoned and balanced out with the scallops nicely.  However what took the dish to the next level in my opinion was the attention to detail found in the veg served on the plate.  Squash, beautiful broccoli, perfectly cooked enoki mushrooms, fresh green beans, and to top it off (and what made me chuckle) was a 2 inch piece of delicious, sweet corn still on the cob.  Nice touch.\n\nI won't go into detail about their must-order signature Kobe short rib, but  I will tell you they braise it for three days to create unparalleled tenderness.\n\nThe service at Todd's is top notch.  Besides being attentive and well versed on the menu and the cooking techniques used, the servers are very nice and not afraid to engage in some friendly conversation.  In my opinion one of the keys to good service is making the customers feel comfortable and they certainly achieve that here.\n\nWith the kind of food and service one might expect from a white tablecloth restaurant, it is refreshing to be served in a more cozy, relaxed environment.  There is a no-smoking bar on one side of the restaurant that has a bit of an old-fashioned feel to it but then they've got the basketball playoffs going on the TV. \n\nTodd is an actual person (chef/owner) and from what I can tell he is there most nights and makes an effort to come out on the floor and interact with the guests, another nice touch.  \n\nI'm glad to have discovered this gem and it's already become a new weekly spot for me in spite of being clear across town from me.", 'business_id': 'URweBWkD1EgPDFUlL0LOKQ', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2009-05-27', 'type': 'review'}

Our ancestors were happy and feasted upon the bounty that was placed before them.  If our ancestors were really lucky, the restaurant would toss the salad for them, and our ancestors would give thanks to the dining gods.  Fast forward several generations, and we are faced with a paradox of choice.  Our ancestors would be awed by opulence available at your neighborhood Vons.  Italian dressing?  We have low-cal, low-fat, organic, and gluten-free.  We even have Italian\'s more sophisticated sibling, balsamic vinaigrette, and even that comes in regular, raspberry, sugar-free, and Atkins-approved.\n\nSo what does all this have to do with Todd\'s Unique Cuisine?  Quite a lot.  Wolfgang Puck opened the first Spago just 25 years ago and since then, our expectations of dining have increased exponentially every year.  Dining at Todd\'s is like prom night.  You go in with unreal expectations that can never be met.  Todd\'s is good.  It\'s just not great.  If Todd\'s were located in Spokane, WA, it\'d be the best restaurant in town.  However, as all things Vegas, we set the bar ridiculously high.  While Todd\'s mix of modern, slightly Asian-inspired fusion fare is definitely delicious, it\'s not exactly cutting edge any more.  If Todd\'s were fashion, it\'d be a pair of bootcut jeans.  Just a season or two out of date.\n\nYes, I know I\'m holding Todd\'s up to a ridiculous standard, but part of it probably comes from the name of the restaurant.  If it was simply called "Todd\'s Cuisine" I may have had a different experience.  Maybe I was expecting too much.  Just like prom night.\n\nPro: Good food, generous-sized portions\nCon: Dining area away from the bar can be loud when there are large groups present.

I try to find something different, something that at the end of the dinner I could honestly say that it was an "experience" rather than a "meal"--and Todd\'s did just that.  For months I would skim over his website, wondering if it would be worth the journey from North Las Vegas to East Sunset in Henderson, and last night we decided to give it a try.  We made reservations through opentable, where I\'ve accumulated 10,000 points so far, and arrived on time at 7:45pm.  The server was friendly, attentive, and although it\'s in a strange place for what I consider high scale service, it was welcomed.  They have a notable wine list, a quaint bar and an interesting drink menu, which we did not partake in that evening.  Concentrating on dissecting textures, tastes and ingredients that night, I can honestly say that I was impressed.  His ravioli\'s, although hesitant at first to order southwest-themed ones, were very good.  Perfectly creamy on the inside, not overpowering sauce on the outside, and the southwest theme played well for something that is of Italian origin.  I very much enjoyed the tomato salad, which was plated beautifully and paired very nicely with a creamy balsamic.  The highlight of the evening were the two dishes of scallops and lamb--sauces to die for, perfectly cooked and very well presented.  Dessert, which was peach and ginger cobbler a la mode, paired with complimentary sparkling wine was the perfect ending to a perfect dinner.  \n\nIf you are the type of person looking for extremely fancy, 5 michelin star food at this place, to be honest, it\'s not that.  It\'s more of a true dining experience in taste and textures both.  It\'s a place where the sauces blow your tastebuds away, where in some miracle mexican pasta isn\'t a bad thing at all, and where the dining at the end can be summed up as a true experience.  The chef knows how to pair flavors and textures well, and present seasonal food with grace and style.  \n\nI gave it a 5/5 stars because it truly deserves it. Knowledgeable staff, great variety, and out of this world flavors. \n\nA new hit for me--now it\'s your turn.', 'business_id': 'URweBWkD1EgPDFUlL0LOKQ', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2009-06-27', 'type': 'review'}

I also really like that they are community contributors, providing services for local non-profits and their customers.\n\nI have been to Todd's several times (about 1 month ago was my most recent visit.)\n\nI found the food in general to be well prepared, with generous servings.  However, I found the food to also be mildly seasoned, which did not provide the depth of flavor I hope for when dining in a finer restaurant.  \n\nFor example, the short rib entree I had was a very large portion, and very well cooked and tender.  However, it had a somewhat bland flavor in my opinion.  This had also been my experience in the past with an ahi entree.  The caesar salad I had was also relatively mild and unremarkable - I typically like a caesar salad at a better restaurant with whole or large fresh piece of romaine, a good portion of anchovy, and fresh large croutons, with the salad well dressed.  This salad was little cut-up pieces of romaine, and just was not prepared in any remarkable way - seemed like a prepared in advance and chilled item that was bland and uninteresting.\n\nThe only outlier in my meals has been the 'Steak On-Fire' entree, which was cooked well, and had a well seasoned and spicy sauce.  I could have lived without the chili cheese fries on the side - messy, overproportioned, and texture was kind of soft/undistinguished based on a variety of ingredients with a similar texture.\n\nBooths are also pretty uncomfortable - these need to be upgraded (too vertical, not enough cushion - just not a very natural seating position for dining).\n\nAgain - I think Todd's is an important restaurant in this neighborhood, especially in that shopping area which is currently seeing difficult times - I just think they need to season their food better and be a little more consistent in the design, preparation and elements of this food.

Apparently you can\'t get potatos instead of rice with mahi mahi beacause our waiter doesn\'t want to get "yelled at"  Poor selection of wines by the glass.', 'business_id': 'URweBWkD1EgPDFUlL0LOKQ', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2010-04-11', 'type': 'review'}

Did some quick research on my phone and I was reminded of Todd's and that I've been wanting to try it for a while. \nThe place is in some random strip mall as many Vegas places are. Nothing too impressive about that or the decor. As people mentioned earlier, it is a little old school 80s but it didn't really bother me too much. It was definitely pretty packed for a Saturday night. \nWe ordered the much hyped goat cheese won-tons to start. They were pretty good but honestly not as unique as I was thinking they would be. I'm a huge goat cheese fan but these honestly didn't taste too different than regular cream cheese won-tons I've had at other places. \nIts been a few months now so I can't remember too clearly what I ordered but I believe it was some type of fish. I know I cleaned my plate and it was good but nothing too memorable. Same reaction for dessert. \nThat being said, the service here was great. Todd is always there working as the chef which is very rare in strip restaurants. His wife was our server and she was very friendly, telling us the story of how Todd started the restaurant and all the places he worked before. We definitely appreciated this personal touch. \nAll in all, this wasn't a bad dining experience however it didn't really live up to my expectations. Perhaps its because I've had such great experiences at other off strip Vegas dining spots such as Firefly and Grimaldi's. If I lived in Henderson, perhaps I would go to this place again. I might even hit it up if I'm in the area. However since I wasn't blown away, I think next time I have the chance to dine off strip I might use the opportunity to go somewhere I haven't tried.", 'business_id': 'URweBWkD1EgPDFUlL0LOKQ', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2010-04-14', 'type': 'review'}

This was, by far, the best dining experience I have ever had in my entire life - so much so that I feel like I should downgrade every other review I have ever made on Yelp by a star or two because this restaurant has blown them all out of the water.\n\nMy friend and I walked in about 10 minutes before our reservation, and the hostess told us it would be about 5 minutes to get a table, so we cozied up to the bar. The bartender showed us the specialty drinks and I ordered a raspberry lemon drop which was the perfect blend of sour-sweet. Right after I ordered the hostess came up to us and told us our table was ready. Grabbed our drinks and added them to our table tab. \n\nSat down and was greeted by our waiter who told us the house specials. When I asked him if a certain soup was vegetarian he said no, but told me he would ask the chef if he would make a special vegetarian dish for me for my entree. We also came specifically for the edamame that was posted on the site but was not on the menu, but our waiter left us for a moment and came back letting us know that both of those items would be up for ordering - actually, he told us he asked Todd if those items were available. Spectacular. Todd\'s has a small menu but they have a small menu for a reason: these items are made to perfection. When you specialize in something, you try to make them right and not go overboard which a lot of restaurants have forgotten to do. \n\nAppetizers:\nEdamame with truffle oil: TO DIE FOR. So good, so tantalizing, just made so well. Definitely a tie for best edamame I\'ve ever had with Kabuki\'s garlic edamame. Delicious.\nCream cheese wontons: AHHHHH. SO GOOD. They are set on top of some red and white sauce that is just too yummy. Crunchy with a creamy center, an absolute delicacy. \nAt this point I also ordered a glass of Merlot which was nice and robust and went well with my vegetables.\nCaesar salad: I have eaten probably a thousand Caesar salads in my lifetime and this one is top three for sure. A large piece of thin, crunchy Parmesan tops this light-tasting Caesar salad with a perfect blend of spices with fresh ground pepper. Ahhhhmazing. \n\nMain course: vegetarian entree with mashed potatoes, asparagus, tomato halves topped with herb breadcrumbs (I exclaimed throughout the meal, "These are NOT tomatoes! They are goddess fruit!") carrots, snap peas, and cabbage with coriander and cumin. The only thing I did not care for was the cabbage but that\'s because I\'m not a cabbage fan. But everything else - heaven. Before tonight I have actually never had asparagus but it was so good!\n\nMy friend ordered the veal (of course he had to order the most politically incorrect thing on the menu in order to counteract my vegetarianism :P) but it came with a pasta dish that was out of this world. Cooked perfectly with the right spices and flavors to make it just right. He didn\'t finish that part, but I did! :D\n\nAlthough I was ridiculously full at this point as was my friend, we still ordered dessert, and we both had a creme brulee with fresh fruit - a strawberry, blueberries, a raspberry, and a slice of kiwi. Crunchy top, fresh fruit, and creamy goodness underneath. A perfect end to the meal.\n\nI don\'t know what the bill came out to be but even if I was the one paying, it would have been totally worth it. The presentation of the food was beautiful, the service was top-notch (any questions we had for our waiter were answered, he was very knowledgeable about the food, and he was a freakin\' ninja with refilling our water - my friend and I didn\'t even realize he had reached across the table to refill them), and the food was phenomenal. Simple yet succulent ingredients and very fresh produce made it all an unforgettable experience. Every thing I put in my mouth was a surprise - it looked like the food I have come to know and love, but tasted better than I could have imagined. The last time I truly ate this well was when I had a personal chef cater to my gastronomical needs. This place is pricey, but worth every penny. If I love anything, it is to eat, and when I eat I want it to be good, and this meal was terrific beyond my wildest dreams. The drinks, the food, the service, the atmosphere - everything was top notch and I cannot wait to come back here again. All my friend and I could talk about after dinner was dinner, and we could only speak in hand movements and yummy sounds ;) In one word: perfection.

We each had a different appetizer, salad, entree\', and desert, and all was the best we had ever had, right down to the Lemon Drop cocktail.\nMy husband took his clients and boss and while there was some hesitation before tasting, (located in a strip mall), that quickly was replaced with extreme satisfaction for the ease of access and awesome meal.   Now the boss requests to go back to "that really great restaurant off the strip".

They specialize in steak and seafood, with an ever-changing menu that focuses on seasonal freshness and strong technique to create some really wonderful dishes.\n\nThe staff is friendly and attentive, with a thorough knowledge of their menu and drink selections.\n\nThe decor at Todd's Unique Dining is simple, straightforward, and elegant. I wouldn't call it bland, because every detail speaks of craftsmanship, but it doesn't draw attention to itself. Nor does it detract from the overall experience. Like everything at Todd's Unique Dining, it strikes a perfect balance on the palate.\n\nAlways order the night's special, which on my latest visit was the Guadalajara Hanger Steak, served medium rare. Marinated with a tangy blend of spices and grilled with a deft touch that created a crunchy, flavorful crust while keeping the center of the steak moist and juicy with just the right amount of chewiness, this steak was beefy perfection.\n\nIt was accompanied by a generous helping of polenta that had been seasoned with green onions and lashings of sriracha that gave the creamy side-dish real bite while still allowing it to fulfill its function as a sop for those precious drippings from the steak.\n\nMy date had Todd's pork tenderloin with granny smith apple glaze. It's an elegant version of a favorite comfort food, with the moist pork seasoned very nicely and the glaze adding a nice note of tart sweetness. Her mashed potatoes came laced with caramelized onions, adding another layer of sweetness, though this was leavened somewhat by the tang of the onion. A lesser chef could have cooked those onions to near tastelessness or left them too raw and biting, but, as you've probably gathered, Todd knows what he's doing.\n\nDessert was a shared apple cobbler. The cobbler was, of course, delicious with a thick, brown-sugar crust that quickly quieted my normally-raging sweet tooth. But the real coup de grace of this dish was the scoop of homemade cinnamon gelato that topped it. It was very nearly too much, but we couldn't resist. We descended on it like we hadn't eaten all day.\n\nIn all, a really wonderful evening.

The service was the best service I've ever had anywhere in Las Vegas and the food was great, but not without flaws here and there. We both enjoyed grumpy's salad (like a wedge salad but already chopped up for you!) and my trout was spectacular. My husband got the steak and it was pretty bad - chewy and nothing special. Dessert was beautifully presented and tasty (a chocolate flourless cake if memory serves). Overall a 4, but not a 5 star dinner. It was $30, however, and it WAS restaurant week, so I went back a few weeks ago determined to have the 5 star evening I was determined Todd's could deliver! \n\nTodd's had sent out an email about how they were one of a few restaurants to get one of the first early shipments of King Crabs this year. I'm a huge crab freak, so I was more than eager to try them. They were sold in 2 or 3 lb dinners at market price ($65ish if memory serves). My husband and I shared this and it was TONS of crab. My husband's family is from Maryland my family is from New Orleans so we're pretty big on crab. Most of the buffet crabs here I find pretty disgusting, and I was eager to have a crab dinner that lived up to my standards! The crab here was phenomenal. I've had king crab many times before but this was by far the best I'd ever had. This crab was fresh off the boat (just 2 days before!) and had never been frozen. Flavor and texture was flawless. I never thought I'd eat the best crab in my life in freaking Henderson, NV, but this happens to be the case !\n\nOther than the mediocre steak during restaurant week, everything about this place has been flawless over our 2 visits.

We love places off the beaten path that have amazing food and worth the drive, thus came finding Todd's.\n\nI stumbled across it using Open Table (I won't go to any restaurant in Vegas with out reservations).  The menu looked amazing, my kind of food, and seemed worth the 8 mile drive from the strip.  \n\nThe restaurant is located in Henderson/Green Valley, and very unassuming.  It would not have been a place I would have even considered had it not been for open table and Yelp reviews.  You may miss it as you drive by.   The decor was ok, very homey feeling, room for about 80 or so diners, with a very nice full bar with seating for another 8 or so.\n\nWe were sat immediately in a booth (most of the restaurant is booths, a couple tables, the one adjacent to us was reserved for a large party).  Our waiter greeted us and gave us a great introduction to the menu.  The menu is printed daily with several daily specials, seasonal specials, and a few regular items that are Todd's Signature items.  We thought we would do a mix of a few of each.\n\nBread arrived, and it was fantastic. A great focaccia and sweet cranberry bread that was wonderful. \n\nWe ordered 2 appetizers.  Their signature Goat Cheese won tons were amazing.  They were the right combination of goat cheese and cream cheese and spices. They were perfectly fried and sitting on a raspberry gastrique swirled with creme fraiche, topped with 3 kinds of sesame seeds and a small amount of fresh basil. OMG YUM!  I also got a glass of Prosecco to go with my appetizers and this matched very well with these.\n\nOur second app was Lobster stuffed mushrooms. Brown mushroom caps that were perfectly cooked and stuffed with lobster. They were served in a small skillet with a small gravy/butter sauce.  There were 8-10 mushrooms which were plenty, we were actually surprised how many we got.\n\nOur second course we did a soup and salad.  I got the Grumpys salad which was like an iceberg wedge that was chopped for you.  The dressing was awesome, the perfect amount of blue cheese, delicious grape tomatoes, and a sprinkle of fresh chives. I didn't know you could make a wedge salad so amazing.  My husband got the special soup of the night which was a mushroom soup with creme fraiche on top.  It tasted like blended fresh mushrooms.  It was definitely not a heavy cream of mushroom soup, but actually nice and light and was fantastic. \n\nFor entrees, I got the Signature Short rib. WOW... I won on this one. It was a baseball sized cut of short rib that was perfectly cooked.  It was almost like a pot roast. Super flavorful, tender and moist.  It was sitting on mashed potatoes that were superb all surrounded by a sauce/gravy that was out of this world.  You could taste the love in this dish. \n\nMy husband got the special of the night which was a seafood risotto. It was just ok.  Honestly, and this is weird to say, there was too much seafood in it, we would have like to have had more of the risotto.  The seafood was good, scallops, mexican sea bass, lobster, and crab, but it was almost overwhelming.  There were also a couple small pieces of shell in the risotto. The flavor was good but it was just not to the level that the short rib was.\n\nFor dessert we got the creme brulee which was fantastic.  A very creamy vanilla custard with a perfect sugar crust on top.  Everything that I love about a great creme brulee.\n\nWhen I went to the bathroom, you can see into the kitchen and you can actually see Todd back there cooking.  I commented to the waiter that this was something that I love.  Many of the celebrity chefs on the Strip just have their name on the entrance and may have helped design the menu but thats about it.  Todd is cooking back there which is something I really appreciate.  As I said before, you can taste the love in his food. \n\nThe food was also reasonably priced, we would have paid at least 50% more for this food at a Strip restaurant in a major hotel.  I also liked that the restaurant was packed on a Wednesday night, packed with locals, and filled with many repeat customers. \n\nI will definitely make a return trip to Todd's on our next Vegas trip.  I think I would have like to have ordered 1 or two more appetizers and just split the entree.  I like more Tapas style dining and the selection of appetizers and salads would make this perfect at Todd's.  I knocked the star off their rating for two reasons: 1 - the shells in my husbands seafood risotto and 2- the booth was a little tight/uncomfortable, I think it may have actually been that booth, it seemed a touch smaller than the rest. \n\nOur waiter said that Todd will usually come out to talk to the patrons, especially first time diners, but he was pretty busy in the kitchen (like I said, restaurant was packed).  He also gave us a tip that on Wednesdays there is no corkage fee for up to two bottles.", 'business_id': 'URweBWkD1EgPDFUlL0LOKQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2011-01-03', 'type': 'review'}

You don\'t expect this gem to be hidden in a strip mall among chain restaurants and nail salons. When you walk in and see the simple, clean, small (the marketer in me wants to say "intimate") dining room, you don\'t expect the food to come out plated like a showpiece from the Food Network. And when you see the (relatively) moderate prices on the menu, you certainly don\'t expect a 5-star dining experience. Yet in each of these assumptions I was surprised - pleasantly surprised. \n\nFrom the signature Asian dumplings, to the seafood chowder, then a plate of sea scallops that left me perfectly satisfied yet desperately craving three more portions - just for the flavor - I could not have asked for more. \n\nThen came the dessert menu!  We opted for a pineapple-apple cobbler with a cinnamon gelato topping. Again, as was par for the evening, the flavors were sumptuous  - a perfectly balanced mix of rich dark seasonings and bright fruity sugars. \n\n My wife and I both enjoyed our 4-course meal immensely and got out for under $100... can\'t complain about that.

So, nothing flashy about it, but looks can be SO decieving!!!\n\nThe service is some of the absolute BEST I have ever seen. Every single person that passed us while we were waiting to be seated asked if we had been helped. And, since we ended up sitting at the bar, we got to see that Mark (the bartender) knew many of the patrons by name as well as their "usual" orders. I thought that was pretty impressive!\n\nSo, the food. I ordered a teryaki halibut whic came with coconut rice & baby bok choy. I asked to sub the bok choy for mashed sweet potato & they mixed it up and sub\'d the rice instead. I was a little sad about missing out on the rice because I had been looking forward to trying it, but I didn\'t have them correct it. The fish, was OUTSTANDING!! It was a good size portion, cooked perfectly, great flavor. Hands down one of my top 10 meals EVER.\n\nMy husband had the "steak on fire" which was skirt steak marinated in various peppers & served with fries. I didn\'t try it since I am not into spicy, but he loved it.\n\nI had a cantaloupe martini which was awesome.

The dumplings were.. fantastic.  Probably the best dumplings I\'ve ever had, I ate my first one without having even tried the dipping sauce.  Perfect amount of crunch, caramelization, flavor, texture, etc.. just fantastic.  The wontons, however, were another story.  I liked it somewhat, but it was a bit too tangy overall.  And.. I love tangy.  It was just overwhelmingly tangy/sour and I wasn\'t able to eat more than two of them, which was a shame because hubby couldn\'t stand it at all so those went to waste (and I usually count on him making up for my minimalist eating).  So, one total winner and one that could have been great but was needing some tweaking to be a winner.\n\nThen the caesar salads arrived.. we both loved it (and the dressing was tangy).  So far, we\'ve got 4 woohoos, one meh, and one yuck.. pretty good rating, overall.\n\nThen.. the entrees.  First, hubby\'s veal schnitzel meal.. the schnitzel was prepared well, the potato salad was warm & vinegary, the glazed carrots had absolutely no flavor anywhere, and the red cabbage was wonderfully flavored with curry.  Unfortunately, the lemon butter sauce for the schnitzel was poured all over it and, since he\'s already been overwhelmed with so much tanginess in the dinner, he\'s rather sick of it.  His favorite part of the dinner was the curried red cabbage, since there was no tanginess whatsoever and his palate needed a reprieve.  So... since it all has to count to one vote, I\'m going to have to give this one a meh from each of us.\n\nI had the scallops, and there were plenty of them on my plate and served with a wonderful sauce that complemented their flavor nicely.  However, and this was important to me.. there was a lot of sand in the scallops.  Nothing is more off-putting than biting into what is supposed to be tender creaminess and getting lots of "crunch" that also tells me that these scallops were NOT cleaned properly, if at all.  They were seared nicely and the sauce was excellent, and the accompanying mushroom potatoes were okay (actually kinda forgot to eat more than one bite of these before I shoved the plate away in disgust).  My vote, with everything good being wiped out by the disgust of the sand, is yuck.. and hubby agreed, so two.\n\nWhen the waitress asked about them, I told her about the sand.. another woman came by to ask about them and I repeated it.  I\'m assuming she was the head waitress or manager confirming that there was a complaint, they didn\'t really explain.  Nothing said or offered, she leaves.\n\nOur creme brulee\'s arrived, they were excellent.. though I\'ll admit that I would have liked the strawberry to have been trimmed to make it edible instead of the greens left on for decoration.  Two woohoos for this.\n\nThe bill arrives.. there was no adjustment for an inedible entree.  I didn\'t insist on it, but I\'ll admit that I do judge a place on good or bad handling of complaints.  They failed that one.\n\nSo, overall... 6 woohoos, 3 mehs, and 3 yucks.. thus the middlin\' star rating.  And no, we won\'t be back.', 'business_id': 'URweBWkD1EgPDFUlL0LOKQ', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2011-10-02', 'type': 'review'}

I missed out!  Though the hubby and I are making up for lost time by patronizing Todd\'s on a frequent basis.\n\nLet\'s talk about the food.  \n\nThe appetizers and salads.  The hubby has tried the ahi tuna tartar, Dungeness crab cake, and Grumpy\'s salad.  He\'s mentioned their good but not exactly what he was expecting.  I always order their caesar salad to start out.  It is delicious!  It\'s not the typical caesar because the dressing is a white balsamic/caesar dressing--it gives it a great flavor!  \n\nFor entrees, I\'ll preface that I was NOT a short rib fan, until I tried Todd\'s.  Just go to their website toddsunique.com and watch the video for the short ribs, and you\'ll want to try them too.  The meat is so moist and falls apart upon it\'s first touch with the fork.  The gravy is succulent, with bits of carrot and onion.  Underneath it all, there\'s the jalapeno mashed potatoes (I get them w/out jalapenos) which carry a nice zest to the plate.  I\'ve also tried their filet mignon, magnificent!  It is served with a complimenting cabernet/blue cheese sauce and a few grilled veggies.  As I mentioned before I do not eat things that have crawled/perched/swam around in the water, so I\'ll relay what the hubby said about the seared scallops.  "They were perfectly cooked," "some of the best scallops I\'ve ever had."  The hubby has also had their shrimp risotto, and said it was very good and rich.  Overall, I might classify Todd\'s style of food as "American Fusion Comfort Food."\n\nDesserts are pretty darn good here too, so leave room!  I\'ll let you explore the dessert menu on your own!\n\nTodd\'s is a very casual, comfortable, homely, semi-fine dining restaurant.  There is a full bar on the right side of the restaurant, and from what I understand they do run food and drink specials at the bar.  I\'ve noticed most of the clientele seems to be more on the mature side (40s+).  That being said, most of the clientele are repeat customers, therefore I do recommend reservations.

As a former Michigan resident I miss the LS Whitefish.  \n\nOne of our party ordered a full order of scallops and said they were the best she'd ever had.  Cindy ordered the  melt-in-your-mouth-like-butter Short Ribs.  A large portion, covered in an untensly flavored and delicious gravy. \n\nSalads all around except for me, were excellent and fresh.  I chose the Asian Dumplings (potstickers) with dipping sauce.  The dumpligs were small, very tender and sooo very deicious as was the dipping sauce.  Not a complaint from anyone at our table.   Oh and the awesome Watermelon/Jalapeno Martini was over the top.  \nBananas Foster for dessert - excellent.   \n\nThe ambiance is very nice, somewhatt romantic if that's what you're looking for and reservations are strongly recommeded.  \n\nOur waitress was quiet, efficient and very polite.  Special thanks to the busser - whose name I didn't get - for taking the photos of our group.", 'business_id': 'URweBWkD1EgPDFUlL0LOKQ', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2012-02-23', 'type': 'review'}

You can make a reservation for lunch or dinner by dialing 702-259-TODD (8633) or take a look at their very informative web page at www,toddsunique, com .\n\nWe arrived about ten minutes early for our appointed time at 6:30 PM. We were greeted by the Hostess Chelsea who seemed to know just who we were even though this was our first experience at Todd\'s. \n\nAlthough small, the restaurant was well set up, clean, and conducive to a fine dining experience. Once we were settled at our table our Server, Terry was there to get us beverages and chat. The menu folder held the menu created by Todd for the 02/27 to 03/03 time period and a separate menu of his offerings for the Restaurant Week Charity Event. \n\nWe were there for the Restaurant Week Experience. Each year we choose a different restaurant to try for this usual fall event. This year the need by "Three Square Food Bank" was such that a decision was made to offer a spring dining week also.\n\n\nFrom the "special" menu we chose:\n\nFIRST COURSE:\n\nGrumpy\'s Salad\n\nCream of Heirloom \n\nSECOND COURSE:\n\nRoast Prime Rib of Pork; Apple Pan Sauce and Sausage Stuffing \n\nFilet Medallions with Wild Mushroom Cabernet\n\nTHIRD COURSE:\n\nHazelnut Cr\xe8me Br\xfbl\xe9e\n\nSalted Butterscotch Pudding\n\n                                                                 **********\n\nDinner of these wonderful sounding items was spectacular. Libby started with the Cream of Heirloom tomatoes. What a beautiful concoction of deep tomato flavor with a smooth light cream finish. My "Grumpy\'s" salad was a classic wedge of lettuce salad with a twist. The lettuce was shredded; there was some diced tomato, and a little onion all mixed together with wonderful blue cheese crumbs. This was piled high on an icy cold plate. Our Server Terry used a big wooden grinder to insure I had enough fresh cracked pepper to satisfy me.\n\nAfter we lazed over our first course Terry and Laura (hope I got this right) presented us with our main courses. We dove in to this repast first tasting our own plates and then on to each other\'s. The best thing to say is everything was a palate delight. Libby\'s medallions of beef were cooked perfectly and so tender that you could by pass chewing and just roll your tongue to bring out the outstanding texture and flavor. My roasted pork (huge) was grilled to perfection, juicy and wound through a myriad of flavors that questioned every taste bud in my mouth. I am still astounded by the mixtures of tastes that one bite could bring bouncing through my mouth. Glorious vegetables that were lightly cooked using different methods to produce texture and flavor explosions adorned our plates. I truly enjoyed the red cabbage with its crunchy and unusual components kept me excited for more. Libby ate her baby carrot and mine too. She also had a homemade and hot potato chip that was crunchy and pleasingly warm. My wonderful wife ate her own baked tomato and the speared mine right off my plate. At least she smiled at me as she finished the little beauty while I pined my existence. There were other veggies but I am just leaving them alone. They were texturally and flavor right. They got eaten too.\n\nNow, let\'s talk desert. The Hazelnut Cr\xe8me Br\xfbl\xe9e was thick and rich with a whipped cream atop. An enticing blue berry and raspberry insured that the looker put a spoon to it. My Salted Butterscotch Pudding was absolutely worth going in to battle to get again. Nestled into a clear glass was a scoop of dangerously tan and creamy butterscotch pudding. Around this ball of fun was a thick almost honey like caramel syrup and a dab of cream fluff that accented the whole artistry. With my first spoonful I ensured that I had pudding, caramel, and topping. The whole thing caught me off guard. I had forgotten the salt. Pudding and cream mix enveloped my every taste bud and as this mixture began to disintegrate I was hit by the salty and sweet aftermath like I had just taken a low right to the jaw. I have never tasted anything like this. It was an amazing creation. I hope I can get it as an entr\xe9e sometime.\n\nThat\'s it. Go to Todd\'s Unique. Feel well cared for and well fed. You will leave after your lunch or dinner thinking only about the next visit you will schedule', 'business_id': 'URweBWkD1EgPDFUlL0LOKQ', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2012-03-01', 'type': 'review'}

Last night was no different.  Todd\'s is participating in the Spring Restaurant (Feb 27 - Mar 4), offering a 3 course dinner @ $30.12/person.  I started with the "Grumpy\'s Salad", which is a delightful mound of chipped lettuce, onions, tomatoes, and blue cheese lightly coated in a creamy dressing.  Because of the texture, the blue cheese sneaks into random bites, which is such a wonderful mid chew surprise!  Other first course options are the Cream of Heirloom Tomato Soup or a Sweet Corn Ravioli.  \n\nSecond Course offerings include Roast Prime Rib of Pork, Grilled Steelhead with Meyer Lemon Aioli & Toasted Cous Cous, Filet Medallions in a Wild Mushroom Cabernet Sauce, Vegetable Risotto, or for $20 more they offer a Surf and Turf with a Maine Lobster Tail.  Most everyone at our table ordered the Grilled Steelhead because we had brought a wine pairing that worked best with the fish.  This was my first time ordering Steelhead, which most resembled the texture and tenderness of salmon.  It was absolutely delicious in the light lemon cream sauce.  I  loved the larger sized cous cous they paired.\n\nMost important note: Every Wednesday night Todd\'s offers free corkage for up to 2 bottles per table!!!\n\nThe third course offers way more choices than any of the other restaurant week dining options with 4 dessert choices that ALL sound yummy to my tummy!  Choices include their Flourless Chocolate Cake with Raspberry and Vanilla Sauce, Hazelnut Cr\xe8me Br\xfbl\xe9e, Salted Butterscotch Pudding topped with Fresh Cream, or an assortment of Housemade Ice Creams.  Since I\'ve ordered their Flourless Chocolate Cake on a few occasions, I went with the Hazelnut Cr\xe8me Br\xfbl\xe9e.  Absolute melt off your chair goodness!   If you are a hazelnut fan & you love cr\xe8me br\xfbl\xe9e, then this is a must have.\n\nMy only regrets about the whole night were that I didn\'t place a to-go order for their duck breast that comes in a pomegranate red wine sauce over a sweet potato pur\xe9e.  This is one of those dishes that food dreams are made of.  Probably one of my top 5 dishes to order in all of Vegas.', 'business_id': 'URweBWkD1EgPDFUlL0LOKQ', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2012-03-01', 'type': 'review'}

I was told years ago this place is a neighborhood gem and I figured it was about time we gave it a try. We had reservations for a five at 6:30. We arrived a bit early and there was no room at the bar so we went to the Coyote Cafe next door for drinks. They had old school video poker and ice cold Modelo Especial. \n\nWhen we returned to Todd's they prepped our table and we were promptly seated. We made our selections and nibbled on bread while we waited for the first course. Each of us chose the Sweet Corn Ravioli with Chipotle Sauce to start. It was tasty but very rich. \n\nFor entrees, two orders of Filet Medallions with Wild Mushroom Cabernet were had, one with the lobster tail for $20 supplement. There were also two orders of Prime Rib of Pork with Apple Pan Sauce and Sausage Stuffing. And I had Grilled Steelhead with Meyer Lemon Aioli, and Toasted Cous Cous. I was told the lobster tail was very good, those that had the filet were happy. The pork was decent, but overcooked. My trout seemed to be one of the better choices, I enjoyed it.\n\nMajority of us had the Hazelnut Creme Brulee for dessert. Myself included, even though I generally do not like creme brulee. It was the hazelnuts sold me. I did not regret my choice. There was also an order of Vanilla Ice Cream and Butterscotch Pudding which was too sweet for my liking.\n\nThe food was solid, but nothing blew me away. It doesn't rival options on the strip, but it's good to support the little guy and you can stretch your dollar at Todd's. Long lulls between courses was the weakest link. It was no fault of the wait staff, they were attentive, the kitchen must have been in the weeds. I think they were overwhelmed by the restaurant week crowd. At least, I hope that was the excuse.", 'business_id': 'URweBWkD1EgPDFUlL0LOKQ', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2012-03-02', 'type': 'review'}

My reservation was for four people at 5:30. Two of us got there early and was told to sit at the bar until the rest of our party came. I had ordered a Joie De Veev. (Is that even how you spell it?) It is a mixture of muddled strawberries, mint, berry vodka, and ginger ale. The drink is refreshing and would be perfect for summer or Vegas winter.\n\nWhen everyone showed up, we were sat and greeted promptly. For appetizers; we started with two Grumpy Salads and two Sweet Corn Raviolis. Nothing wow inducing, but edible. The salad was plain and the sauce for the ravioli was rich with no kick. For entrees; two of us got the prime rib of pork, one steelhead, and one beef medallion. Everyone was happy with these dishes. All of the meats were cooked to perfection. For the dessert course; we ordered the chocolate ice cream, hazelnut creme brulee, salted caramel pudding, and the flourless chocolate cake. My favorite was the salted caramel pudding. It had a nice balance. The creme brulee was underwhelming and was the least favorite for the group.\n\nThe service was great. It looked like the room worked as a team. We had our waitress, but throughout the meal multiple people stopped by with food, refills and to clear plates.

Made a reservation Friday 9PM, came a bit early, and didn't get seated until 930PM. Okay no problem you're busy, but I did see empty tables in the dining room. Service was a hit and miss throughout the night, seemed to be a lot of tension between the waitress and the bussers. \n\nStarted with a Grumpy's salad and a heirloom tomato bisque for appetizers. The tomato bisque was creamy and delicious, but the grumpy's salad was overwhelmed with cheese. For entrees we ordered the beef medallions (medium-rare) and the prime pork ribs. Both equally tough to chew, but had a very nice presentation, accompanying items didn't do much to complement flavor wise though. Lastly the desserts ordered were the hazelnut creme brulee and the salted caramel pudding. Creme brulee was disappointing and lacked the wonderful experience of breaking the torched sugar coat on top. Salted caramel pudding sweetness was overwhelming. \n\nAll and all, I'm glad I tried it just to have it crossed off my list of to-do's, but considering it was a 30 minute drive, and so-so experience, I will probably not come back.", 'business_id': 'URweBWkD1EgPDFUlL0LOKQ', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2012-03-08', 'type': 'review'}

This one is from Spring Restaurant Week '12. Dining out at any half-decent, upscale place should be relaxing. That wasn't the vibe I got as we entered. It was a madhouse with servers and hostesses running around frantically with overwhelmed and panicked looks on their faces. Granted, it was a Saturday night during restaurant week, but I've seen plenty of places handle the rush much better.\n\nThe waiting area by the host stand is only large enough for about four people to stand. Any more than that and you'll feel like you're in the way. It's probably best to wait outside if you can.\n\nLuckily, the table we were seated at was away from all the commotion. The interior of the restaurant feels dated -- the kind of dark greens and browns that remind me of a cheap hotel.\n\nAs for the food, it wasn't bad. We both opted for the RW menu, starting off with the sweet corn ravioli, which could have used more sauce and some acidity to cut through the sweetness of it.\n\nThe filet medallions were a fairly large size, but the quality of the beef was tougher than expected. The roast prime rib of pork was a massive chunk of meat that was as tender as a pork chop could be. The accompanying mashed potatoes were delicious and the cabbage added a welcoming bit of crunch to the meal.\n\nThe desserts were the highlight of the meal. The flourless chocolate cake was rich and sweet and the perfect size to satisfy your sweet tooth without making you feel like you overindulged. The butterscotch pudding was similar to a budino but wasn't as creamy or silky smooth. \n\nAfter hearing so many good things about this place, my expectations were high. Unfortunately, Todd's Unique Dining wasn't able to meet them. The food was pretty good all the way around, but lacked the wow factor of more acclaimed spots around town.

Our reservations were acknowledged and quickly honored, and not a moment too soon.  For, several parties arrived just after us.  The place was quickly packed with people and frantic servers.  But, initially, ours did not move fast enough.  Although our server said she would get us set with water and bread, she next took orders from an adjoining table of 11 diners instead.  When, after hailing a busser, our bread basket did finally arrive, it contained very good raisin bread but there was nothing special about the white bread.  The ambiance was homey but, as other Yelpers have previously noted, our straightback booth was rather cramped and uncomfortable.  \n\nA bowl of Cream of Heirloom Tomato Soup was very good.  Unusual Sweet Corn Ravioli tasted pretty good.  And, Grumpy\'s Salad turned out to be like a chopped wedge salad.  The medium-rare Filet Medallions I was served were excellent and buttery but very peppery, although I got used to the spice.  The Wild Mushroom Cabernet Sauce ladled under it tasted good.  So did Mashed Potatoes.  While a tomato on my plate was perfectly cooked, lengths of carrot served wild rabbit-style were too hard for my taste and julienned red beets accompanying Roast Prime Rib of Pork with Sausage Stuffing were undercooked.  I found Mexican Squash and Enoki Mushrooms to be pleasant but unremarkable.\n\nI thought "Todd\'s" etched in cocoa powder was a nice visual touch next to a great-tasting Flourless Chocolate Cake with excellent Rasbperry and Vanilla Sauce.

Our waitress was on point and even though the restaurant was completely packed she stayed on top of things.\n\nAll that said, I am not a huge fan of Todd's decor. I feel that ambiance can be a very important component to one's entire dining experience when at a particular establishment. As a result, the generic, kind of tired fabric, on the booth seats at Todd's is not attractive. Everything is clean but there were areas that looked a bit worn.", 'business_id': 'URweBWkD1EgPDFUlL0LOKQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2012-07-07', 'type': 'review'}

We had a 7:30 reservation and we seated immediately. I have been hearing rave reviews and was quite excited to try this place. I LOVE going to none chain- local places. The waitress came and plopped down the menus and only one wine list. We were a group of 3 women and all wanted something different to drink. The server was not terrible, but for the prices and what I think they want to be she needs a lot of training. To me correct etiquette and flow is what makes a great server. It's all part of a fine dining experience. She boringly rattled off the specials, she didn't really seem to even know for sure what it consisted of. We ordered and when the food arrived she plunked it down on the table like it was IHOP. Really rather annoying. I ordered the steak on fire and a beet salad. Beet salad description said it had grapefruit. I didn't see or taste it, but it was really good (fantastic) anyway. The steak was really good for a few bites. I think all the cheese on the fries was overwhelming. My friend had the same, she said she loved it, but only ate about 3 bites. He daughter had scallops and said she liked it. None of us were raving or swooning over the food. It was good. But def didn't live up to all the hype I have been hearing. Our water was never refilled and that steak was so hot I really wanted water. They also were playing a football game which I found odd and anoying in fine dining and at those prices. But I really got annoyed at the end of the meal. We haven't seen each other in quite awhile and were enjoying catching up. We finished eating at about 9. The waitress dropped off the check and we were talking. She never returned to see if we wanted anything else. They started tearing the bar apart for heavy cleaning at 9. They were banging and clanging away. The lights got brighter as well. Then at about 9:30 it felt like they shut off the air to get rid of us. It was about 200 degrees and the entire place was getting torn down. The hours state open till 10. First of all if the waitress ever came back we wanted to have more drinks, it wasn't time for them to close and there was no one waiting for our table. I could understand we would be a bother if it was time to go home or they needed to turn the table for another reservation. These kind of things are why locally owned places never survive. The whole point is making the guests feel welcome and wanted. Olive Garden next door has a warmer vibe. Also, their website states a $30 PP average. All our entress were $36, plus salad and 2 drinks each the bill was QUITE a bit more pricy.

What I mean, is that the setting is very low lit, and quiet.  There was only 3-4 other tables there at the time, so this could be part of the reason.  So you can understand how I felt out of place with my little one....\n\nThey do NOT expect you to bring kids....they do NOT have booster seats or highchairs.  Good thing my little foodie baby loves to eat, and is well mannered...most of the time anyways ;)\n\nNow that I have that out of the way, on to the food!\n\nWe tried the crab cake and tuna tartare.  The crab cake was good, but I am jaded with Del Frisco\'s and I still order them.  The tuna tartare was good, with a little spice from the hot sauce, however the consistency of the tuna was kind of mushy, and not like the tartare that I am used to (thick cuts of fish).  This was more of a blended/smashed consistency....not bad, but it was a little distracting personally.\n\nWent with the duck and the sea bass.  This is what they do well here!  The duck was crazy tender, and did not have the slightest "gammy" taste that one would expect with most duck.  The sauce was packed with flavor and the sides were all delicious.  The sea bass was super tender, and cooked perfectly.  The flavor was great as well!\n\nWent with the bread pudding and it was good.  Not mind blowing, but it was good nonetheless.  We also tried some of their dessert wine on the house, which was a very nice touch.\n\nOnly other thing I would slightly complain about...the prices here are a little substantial.  I have paid quite a bit more for food, so don\'t get me wrong, but each app was $11-12 and most of the entrees are $25-30 each.  You are going to spend at least $50-60pp even without alcohol IMO, which to be fair is still a good deal here, but I feel like it goes a little farther elsewhere in town.\n\nStill have to give it a go!

My mother and I decided to try something new, instead of all the typical chain restaurants, and I am so glad we did.  We were looking for a nice steak and seafood restaurant away fromThe Strip and my mother found this place through Yelp.  We called at 4:45 to make a reservation and we were able to get a table at 5:30pm on a Friday night.  One of the questions that was asked while making our reservation was if we were celebrating a special occasion this evening.  We weren't, but, what a nice question to be asked while making a reservation.  We arrived a few minutes early and were greeted at the door before being taken directly to our table.  The ambiance was very nice - low-lit, quiet and small (in a good way).  Our server was terrific and helped guide us through the menu.  \nWe started with an appetizer of calamari and shrimp.  I have never had calamari so tender and the shrimp were cooked to perfection.  The breading is flavorful, but not overpowering, and not at all greasy.  The chipotle dipping sauce wasn't even necessary - I used just a squeeze of lemon.  \nWhen ordering, out server asked if we would like to split a salad.  What a perfect idea!  We split the house salad that included cucumber and tomato with assorted greens and a perfect raspberry vinaigrette.  I don't usually eat salads with any dressings at all, but I enjoyed this one.\nI ordered the sea bass with tomato risotto and asparagus and my mother ordered the sea scallops with mashed potatoes in a pistachio-mushroom sauce.  The sea bass was exquisite, perfectly cooked and I thought the tomato risotto was a terrific compliment.  I didn't enjoy the asparagus, but that was just me and the fact that asparagus is out-of-season. I'm sure most people will enjoy the smokey flavor, I just wasn't a fan.  My mother's scallops were seared beautifully and the accompanying sauce and potatoes were also enjoyed. \nWe decided to share a dessert and ordered the chocolate cake with vanilla and raspberry sauces and added vanilla ice cream a la mode.  The cake was warm and rich and perfectly paired with the sauces and the ice cream.  We both wanted to lick our plates clean.   \nThe portions were just right at Todd's - not too heavy - and we walked out full, but not uncomfortably so.  Appetizers, salads and desserts run $6-$14, with entrees $25-$40, so expect to pay about $100 for 2, unless you order from the prix fixe.  This is not a child-friendly environment, so don't bring the kids.  There are no high chairs, booster seats or kids menus.  \nThe food, service and ambiance were all fantastic at this unassuming location in one of the numerous strip malls around Las Vegas.

The steak was cooked as ordered with a black bean chili sauce gently kissing the top of this mound of meat!  Chili cheese fries were the chosen side to the steak which also had this delightful black bean chili sauce over the top.  The flavor of the sauce is making my mouth water just thinking about it.

Snickerdoodle Bread Pudding and Peach Cobbler.  Ok... twist my arm.   LOL   The bread pudding was right up my husbands alley being as it wasn\'t baked with raisins.  Oh the joy!

We noticed that Todds has vegan and vegetarian option designations on the menu, however there were no entrees or salad/appetizer items that were offered that evening. With a vegan diner, we informed the waitress to see what could be worked out. Looked dicey at first as the only option was essentially a vegetable box, but she spoke with Todd and came back with a vegan mushroom risotto option and salad option that worked well and were very well prepared. Spinach salad, Rare Ahi Tuna, a classic martini, and a surprise birthday treat for me were all very good-my only quibble is that the sauce with the Tuna was very salty to my tongue, however I am not a "salter" in general so perhaps others would not find it so. I enjoy highly spiced or flavored, but this was perhaps too heavy on the soy. Portions are moderate, and the prices are fair-I do feel the entrees were expensive for the suburbs and portion size at $27, however the other ala carte items seemed more in line.

I wasn't wow'ed but everything was fresh. It just lacked the extra element to take it to the top.  Next came their signature braised short ribs and this was disappointing.  The portions were huge and the jalape\xf1o mashed potatoes were good but the short ribs weren't seasoned at all.  It was slightly over cooked and I had to douse it with salt - a good 2-3 salt applications.  I'm not one to usually season my food especially at a fine dining spot where execution on a signature dish should be like a layup.  The highlight of the meal was the chocolate cake definitely.\n\nFor the money there's far too many other options to spend your money.

I am so glad I did. It's small and it was a little warm when we got there but I am so glad I went. First we started with the wontons which were really amazing. I don't normally like wontons but these were crispy and savory and were really good. I got the short rib which is a favorite of mine to order at restaurants especially when the meat is as tender as it was a Todd's. But I really really have to say that this portion was humongous one of the biggest portions of short ribs I have ever seen. I was so happy to eat it last night and I'll be happy to eat it again tomorrow night. It came with jalapeno mash potatoes which I don't know how Todd did this but he managed to get all of the flavor of jalapeno and not an over amount of the spice of the jalapeno. One of the best things I have ever tasted in my life. When I asked for my meal to be boxed I really really wanted to box it myself because I have this strange feeling that I'm the only one that could box it exactly the way I wanted it and I wanted every drop of that delectable sauce in my box. I just have to trust that they got it all in for me. We had two desserts to share between five people it was the brownie and the peach cobbler. I will come back to Todd's because the menu was fantastic it changes seasonally I was told by the waitress who was incredibly knowledgeable and very attentive and I am dying to try the scallops!!!!", 'business_id': 'URweBWkD1EgPDFUlL0LOKQ', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2014-07-16', 'type': 'review'}

I can't begin to describe how disappointed I was with the experience and the food. I waited a week before writing a review because I would have annihilated them had I written the review at the time....\n\nIt started off with them seating us in the noisy bar area even though my husband had told them it was my birthday when he made the reservations. I thought it inappropriate for them to seat us in the bar when you are celebrating a special occasion. We moved into the dining area and I was ready for an amazing meal. We started with the goat cheese won tons and ahi tuna appetizer. They were both slightly above average but both needed more sauce. We also tried 2 specialty cocktails and neither were very good, and tasted watery. \n\nNow for the entree, I ordered the Alaskan halibut (btw- what I was served looked nothing like the other reviewer's pic of halibut) thinking it would be absolutely divine, my husband had scallops. What a disappointment!!! My halibut was not fresh caught, tasted like it had just come out of the freezer, AND was overcooked to the point of being completely dry. I had to eat the weird sauce that came with it just to be able to eat the dry chunk of fish. What a waste for the most expensive item on the menu. The scallops were not cooked properly either and were mushy, instead of having a nice crisp on the ends. Both meals came with mashed potatoes that were clearly yesterday's leftovers as they were cold in the center and tasted like a blend of instant and real mashed potatoes. They didn't have flavor and came with an unappetizing gravy that tasted canned. The entire meal was a disappointment but I scarfed down the food just so I could get out of there. Their only saving grace and reason I gave them more than 1 star was that they brought out a birthday dessert for me. \n\nThis is the 2nd year in a row that I had a crappy birthday dinner from trying a new place based on Yelp reviews. I have found many amazing restaurants based on other reviews but I seem to be unlucky on my birthdays. I think next year I will just go somewhere I already know is good.", 'business_id': 'URweBWkD1EgPDFUlL0LOKQ', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2014-08-23', 'type': 'review'}

On arrival we ordered the calamari as an appetizer. It was probably the best calamari I've ever had they spice it perfectly and it did not have any of that rubbery chew you might find at other places. I highly recommend this appetizer. \n\nFor dinner I went with there special of the night Alaskan king crab. Now this isn't just king crab its fresh king crab that had never been frozen. The taste was divine! the order was supposed to come with about a pound of crab the server told us. I received at least 3 king crab legs so much more then a pound. My wife chose to have the halibut and shrimp risotto, she said it was very tasty though the crab was better. \n\nFor desert we went with a blueberry and coconut apple cobbler.

This restaurant is small and intimate (make a reservation!) and serves wonderfully diverse, delicious food.  Our last visit was 12/20/14, which happened to be the 23rd anniversary of when my hubby and I met.  Not a significant anniversary to anyone else--certainly most people celebrate a wedding anniversary more often than a "day we met" one--but we happened to be talking about it and the waitress overheard.  At the end of the wonderful meal, she served us a lovely little complementary "Happy Anniversary" tiramisu dessert.  A total surprise to both of us and the kind of thing that brings customers back.\n\nBut I digress...the meal itself was *delicious*.  We started with a house salad--highly recommended mixed vegetables with the most wonderful hibiscus-garlic dressing (we joked about getting a bowl of dressing as a soup!)  After that, my husband had the sea bass with a tomatoey risotto, and it was just out of this world.  Having a weakness for comfort food, especially this time of year, I ordered the meat loaf--and was swoonily comforted!  What a wonderful meat loaf this was, seasoned just right, served with a creamy swirl of mashed potatoes and yummy gravy and caramalized onions.  Did I mention, this portion would make TWO meals???  Really, I boxed it up at the end and had it the next day because yummm.\n\nWe ordered a Bananas Foster for dessert (not knowing we were getting the aforementioned tiramisu!) and it was delicious.  The only thing I might wonder about--not really complain, just wonder--is that, isn\'t Bananas Foster usually served flaming?  Ours was not.

My husband wanted to do something special for his bday this year, so we attended the February wine dinner (apologies for my tardiness in this review). The food was really good (until dessert, which was just ok), but the wines kinda sucked. Also, it was no bargain - at $120/head, it was one of Todd's pricier wine dinners.\n\nNot sure if it was the fault of Todd or the winemaker, but I think it's tough for anybody to do an entire meal pairing consisting of only zinfandel blends. It's probably my own fault for not doing more research on the winery/wines to see what we would be having, but I put full trust in Todd. We were treated to scallops (yum) paired with a zin blend (weird). Salad with a zin blend. Salmon with a zin blend, short ribs with a zin blend, and finally a cannoli with a zin blend. Honestly, I tried the last 2 wines just to see if something had changed. I was so so so excited leading up to this dinner. The food and service did not disappoint, but the wines fell way short.

For example, one of us had seared scallops, which are nearly impossible to prepare, plate and serve simultaneously with other plates at the same table (short ribs with jalapeno mash).  The scallops were divine, as were the hors d'oeuvres and the short ribs.\n\nMark's service was very good.\n\nTo step up to five stars, my wife and I would recommend the following:\n\n1.  Step up the quality of the wine list considerably.  We could only drink wine by the glass that night.  Even so, it would have been wonderful to see some superb wines by the glass on offer -- something in the $20 per glass range.\n\n2.  The Caesar salad was very plain:  Just torn lettuce, a tiny bit of dressing (almost none) and two mandolin-sliced pieces of cheese.  The ingredients were fresh, but this really, really needed help: It was almost flavorless, the presentation was awful, and there were no anchovies on offer.  What is Caesar salad without anchovies?  Well, it's a Pizza Hut salad, that's what it is.\n\n3.  Due to the severe drought, we realize that there must be an economy of service.  If the drought ever ends, then we strongly recommend stepping up the service:  (a)  Pour the wine into fresh wine glasses each time, (b) use table cloths on each table, (c) provide full service for the silverware, (d) unfold napkins and offer to place in clients' laps, and (e) use a crumb scraper to remove bits from the tablecloth at least twice during the meal.", 'business_id': 'URweBWkD1EgPDFUlL0LOKQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2015-04-15', 'type': 'review'}

Patrons dress casually, which is nice. A star for delivering a nice atmosphere.\n\nSERVICE:  The waiters here are dressed up and polite. I'd say they deliver the same service that you'd expect in a five star establishment! More upscale service than your average Taco Bell establishment for sure! Another star!\n\nFOOD: I started off with the Goats Cheese with Raspberry Basil Sauce as an appetizer. I have to say while this was delicious it was sweet enough that I think it would rather be better as a dessert. I don't recommend this as an appetizer, again too sweet. My main entree was the Lamb 2 ways. I always enjoy a good lamb, however while it was good it wasn't mind blowing. Since the overall the food was just okay, only one star here.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: Is Taco Bell better? Yes\n\nLook you're in Henderson, which means you're just miles away from the Las Vegas Strip.

This has been my favorite restaurant in town since I moved to Las Vegas two years ago. It's my favorite for not only food, but for the consistently great service.\n\nI've never had anything here that was less than excellent. My favorite entree is the skirt steak on fire. To die for! It is the spice and flavor I crave with a nice tender steak. The fries served alongside complement the steak nicely. All of the desserts are amazing, but the butterscotch pudding is my favorite because it's not only delicious, but unique as well. I love that the cobbler flavors change seasonally and make a nice finish to a meal as well. The scallop entree is quite remarkable as well, perfectly prepared with a tasty sauce applied in the perfect amount. The drinks are always delicious as well. When watermelon is seasonal they make a great watermelon martini with fresh watermelon.", 'business_id': 'URweBWkD1EgPDFUlL0LOKQ', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2015-06-07', 'type': 'review'}

I had heard so many wonderful things about it.  My husband and I were a little underwhelmed.  The appetizers and cocktails were fabulous!  The crab cake with curry sauce was delicious.  The ahi tuna was fantastic and the goat cheese wontons were yummy. My husband ordered the Whiskey Smash cocktail and I ordered the watermelon martini, both were excellent.  I had the beet salad, which was mediocre.  For dinner I had the spare ribs, which tasted like a regular old pot roast.  My husband had the halibut.  It was dry and overcooked.  All in all it was a nice dinner.  I would go back for cocktails and appetizers, but not for dinner.  With so many amazing restaurants in Las Vegas, this one missed the mark a bit.", 'business_id': 'URweBWkD1EgPDFUlL0LOKQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2015-06-24', 'type': 'review'}

I think we've tried to go on 2 other occasions & each time, there was no availability. \nFirst thing I noticed walking in was the  decor. It has a very casual, 80's diner theme & not what I was expecting for a nicer, upscale restaurant. The very nice hostess seated us in a booth which turned out to be very uncomfortable. Nothing worse than an uncomfortable booth! \nWe started with the Dungeness crab cake appetizer & tuna tartar on crispy rice. The tuna was spot on, really delicious. But I think you could serve dog food to me on crispy rice & I would still think it was delicious. That crispy rice is becoming an addiction that could get very out of control! The Dungeness crab was a big disappointment. The cake itself was way too mushy & the accompanying curry sauce was too strong. It's almost like they just made the sauce & added some curry to it. I think the key to cooking/eating curry is to toast or saut\xe9 it before using it to flavor whatever dish you're making with it. \nFor dinner, hubby got the petite filet & I got the scallops. Hubby's filet was perfect, cooked exactly like he likes it, rare, & served along with pesto mashed potatoes & a delicious sauce. My scallops were good & cooked perfectly as well but my mashed potatoes were way too dry & just ended up being a disappointing afterthought. \nAll in all, our meal was good but I guess I was expecting more & that always tends to leave me disappointed. We will prob try them again but I don't think we'll rush back anytime soon.", 'business_id': 'URweBWkD1EgPDFUlL0LOKQ', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2015-07-02', 'type': 'review'}
