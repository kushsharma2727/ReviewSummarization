The place was packed!  However, it was our lucky day when our friends got there just in time to get us a prime spot at a bar table!\n\nThere were servers and staff everywhere, so even though the confusion of opening night was obvious, everyone was having a great time and there were plenty of people helping out so it didn\'t really matter.  We ordered a few appetizers and four personal (7") pizzas.  \n\nThe Trio of Meatballs appetizer was awesome!  Huge meatballs in a delicious vodka sauce (that is fantastic as a dipping sauce for any type of bread or pizza crust, so ask for a side) for only $3.99!\n\nThe BF had the "Here\'s the Beef" pizza which looked meaty and delicious.  I probably would have had a bite, but my Da Greek pizza was overflowing with fantastic toppings (feta, kalamata olives, pepperoncini, spinach, and tomatoes) that I didn\'t want anything to mess with the flavors.\n\nEvery day is a different daily drink special and $2 PBR all day, every day.\n\nI would say that I can\'t wait for the place to calm down so I can go back, but to be honest, I don\'t really care.  I\'ll go back even if it is just as busy as opening night.  The food was wonderful, the service was great, and the atmosphere is something I wanted to be part of.  \n\nThe only bad part about Spinato\'s opening in the Tuke is going to be deciding which of my favorite pizza joints I\'m going to pick on any given night!', 'business_id': 'ZRJwVLyzEJq1VAihDhYiow', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2011-03-28', 'type': 'review'}

Pizza has always been great, so when Spinato\'s opened in Ahwatukee I couldn\'t wait to visit and try some of their other items. \n\nI was pretty underwhelmed by the whole experience. Italian bread is $1.99 for something that really should be complimentary. I guess this is a sign of the times, though, so I wouldn\'t hold that against them if the bread was tasty. But unfortunately, it was nothing special, so please don\'t waste your money. There was zero flavor and nothing "Italian" about it.\n\nI personally had basic spaghetti with marinara sauce. The sauce was good, but the portion was small for the price ($7.49). Again, not very surprising. What I was surprised about was the amount of time two simple plates of spaghetti took to come out. I\'m usually not one to compare the speed of my food to others in the restaurant, because I know food takes different times to prepare and all, but I have do it this time. While we were waiting I had time to observe a table of five that were ordering at the table next to us. They spent quite some time giving all of their picky special requests, yet they still received their food before us. All of that before two simple plates of spaghetti?\n\nI was very disappointed with the service we received. There were employees everywhere, and everyone was very pleasant, but I do feel like our server ignored us to pay more attention to the table next to us. I don\'t think it was a coincidence that this other table had four servings of alcohol. I guess he didn\'t want to waste time on us when he thought he\'d be getting a bigger tip from them. Again, while waiting for our food I had time to look around and I saw another one of his tables (also without alcohol) being ignored as well. The only time he seemed to make us a priority was when a manager came over and asked if everything was okay.  Then he rushed right over to clear our plates and ask if we needed dessert. \n\nI\'ll still give them another shot and pick up a pizza in the future, but I\'ll stay away from dining in.', 'business_id': 'ZRJwVLyzEJq1VAihDhYiow', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2011-05-07', 'type': 'review'}

So yes, this is a kid-friendly restaurant, which unfortunately translates to mediocre food at best. That is exactly what we got.\n\nThere are two elements that are crucial to making a good pizza and making a pizzeria stand out from the others: The sauce and the crust. Spinato\'s failed on both of these counts.\n\nWe ordered the pizza and when it was served it looked delicious. After the first bite is when everything went downhill. The sauce, as stated by many people, was sweet and plain - not a hint of Italian seasoning in it. I was prepared for this, and before the pizza was even served I asked the waiter for Italian seasoning. He looked confused. So I said, oregano. He brought a ramekin with a sparse amount (I guess they need to save those pennies). \n\nThis did not save the pizza because of crucial element no. 2: The crust that wasn\'t there. I am serious, the crust was pure air, nothing to it. Wonder Bread has more substance and heartiness to it than their crust had. I have never in my life, including any frozen pizza I\'ve ever eaten, had a more tasteless, pathetic pizza crust than what was delivered. My friend, who doesn\'t have a keen sense for good food, said "well maybe it wasn\'t in the oven long enough".

She seemed a bit stressed out because the restaurant was literally packed full. There was a wait to be seated but since I was just in a party of 2 they were able to seat us in the corner immediately. \n\nMost Italian restaurants I have been to give you bread and butter at your table for free but Spinato\'s charges $2 for their bread abd butter and when it came to the table I wanted to laugh.

Spinato\'s is a locally owned family pizzeria that started in Phoenix in 1974. They now have 5 locations spread throughout the valley. Since I\'m not a big fan of chain restaurants, I was more than excited to try this new pizzeria especially since it was Chicago style pizza. The best pizza I ever had was in fact in Chicago.\n\nWe arrived around 5:30 on Friday evening and the place was starting to getting crowded. The hostess seated us in the bar area since it seemed like a more ideal place to sit versus the dining room. She dropped off the menus and advised that our server would be with us momentarily. We waited about 15 minutes or so before our server acknowledged that we were in her section. She got our drink and food orders since we had more than enough time to make up our minds.\n\nMy friend opted to get the Going Greek salad (side $3.99) and the Tomato Basil Bruschetta ($7.29). I decided on the personal 7" sized Baked Spaghetti Calzone w/meatballs ($5.49). I decided to not drink as I had to drive and I wanted to get dessert.\n\nShe got her salad and the bruschetta which she shared with me. When I think of bruschetta, I imagine it on a sturdy crispy piece of french bread or baguette  not on a piece of focaccia. Now don\'t get me wrong - I love focaccia as much as the next person, but focaccia isn\'t a sturdy piece of bread to pile on tomatoes drenched in olive oil and balsamic vinegar. The bruschetta was good but did not blow me away by any means. It had good flavor but it\'s not something that sticks out in my mind.\n\nHalf way through the bruschetta, our server brought the baked spagetti calzone which was enormous and I got the smallest size! I can only imagine what the other sizes look like (out of control). It smelled delicious and had marinara sauce spilling over the top of it. I took my first bite and was absolutely horrified by what I tasted. The sauce was sweet?! Who on earth makes sweet marinara sauce? That should be a crime! It didn\'t even have the slight essence of Italian herbs that are a requirement in all marinara sauces and the sweetness was overbearing. I had to doctor it up by piling on the parmeasan and the red pepper flakes before I deemed it edible. I was able to eat half of it before I decided it was time for dessert.\n\nThe dessert was Spinato\'s only saving grace from getting one star from me. I\'m partially lactose intolerant and can\'t eat ice cream, ranch or sour cream (I know my life sucks!) they had gelato which I can eat! My friend got two scoops of vanilla bean and chocolate and I decided to get pistachio, raspberry sorbet, and vanilla bean. The gelato was decadently smooth and creamy. I wasn\'t thrilled about the pistachio as I could sense the almond extract in it and I\'m not a fan! The raspberry and vanilla bean made up for it. The raspberry sorbet was tart and sweet and mixed with the vanilla bean balanced each other out.\nWe had to be wheeled out because we were so full...it was official - I had a spaghetti calazone baby! Overall, I was not impressed with Spinato\'s and there are better pizzerias in Phoenix that one can go to. I like that it\'s locally owned, a family owned business, and their gelato.', 'business_id': 'ZRJwVLyzEJq1VAihDhYiow', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2011-07-11', 'type': 'review'}

There are so many things I enjoy about this place, I am a little torn on where to start.\n\nQuickly I will give a recommended first trip order, and then give details about what I love about this place:\n\nDrink (Any Arizona Stronghold wine, I really like their reds - Dala specificly)\n\nApp (Meatball trio in Vodka Sauce - it didn't sound good to me either, and then I tasted it WOW!)\n\nPizza (thin crust Spicy Italian (w/ Jalepanos) or (The Combo).\n\nDessert - (Pistachio Gelato)\n\nOk, start from the outside, work my way inside, and work from apps and drinks through dessert.\n\nOutside:  GORGEOUS, one story brick building on Chandler Blvd between 48th and 50th Street (just west of the I-10 exit).  The parking lot is very crowded during the busier times (evenings, especially Friday and Saturday).  \n\nInside: Once you are inside the building, there isn't a large waiting area, and once you get your seats, you will see why.  They maximum the space in the building for those sitting and enjoying their food/drinks.  Even in the areas where there are more tables (eastside of the building), it never feels too crowded to me.  The westside of the building is the bar, and smaller tables with really nice, fabric-covered seats (fancy). :)\n\nStaff:  The hostesses, to the waitstaff, to the managers (who my wife and I met while dinning on a less busy Saturday afternoon) are fantastic at customer service.  I can't think of a single time we have been that we haven't really enjoyed ourselves, and part of that can be attributed to the wonderful people who wait on us.\n\nDrinks:  Very good wine selection (whites and reds) and they do a respectable job making sure to work in good, quality local winieries (Arizona Stronghold and Pilsbury come to mind).  My only (slight) complaint, is I would like to see a wider craft beer selection (especially as many local brewers as possible, Four Peaks, Sun Up, to name a few).\n\nFood: OMG! This food is always fantastic.  My wife and I always get the meatball trio in vodka sauce.  These are the most moist and flavorful meatballs I have eaten, and that doesn't even include the vodka sauce and cheese in which the meatballs are cooked.  \n\nPizzas - Haven't had a bad one yet; the only one's I am not as in love with are any of the one's that come with spinich (I think because I don't love cooked spinich, not because they aren't doing something right).\n\nSandwiches - Haven't had one, so no opinion (although the ones to pass my table smelled great! :) ).\n\nPasta - My wife had the special, which was a seafood and pasta dish  which had scallops (cooked perfectly), baby clams, and shrimp (so tender) in a wonderful tomato sauce.  I don't like clams, but this all blended so nicely where no parts of the seafood or pasta, or sauce over-powered one another.\n\nDessert - I know Italian resturants should have a good cannoli (and this place does), I am usually so stuffed from my dinner we never order it.  Until our last trip, when the waiter (playfully) made us order the gelato (Pistachio).  We are so glad he did!

I ordered a chicken parm sandwich and was very surprised to see that the chicken was clearly from a freezer variety breast that we can all find at Costco or anywhere else.  This was disheartening, given the fact that the bread was soft on the inside and crusty on the outside, and all the other ingredients were spot on.  Why would they risk everything by cutting corners on their meats?  Made me wonder, how many other ingredients originate in a freezer box.  \n\nAs Gordon Ramsey would say..... They probably spend more time and energy freezing, thawing, and recooking this chicken then they would with fresh product.  \n\nI am afraid to try the Italian Beef, as this is another Chicago Original that i would demand nothing less then perfection on.

One\'s opinion of Spinato\'s hinges almost totally on his opinion of the unusually sweet sauce.  After yesterday\'s experience, I\'ve decided that I love Spinato\'s as on occasional treat, but it\'s a little rich to be my go-to pizza place.\n\nEverything besides the sauce on the pizza was nearly beyond reproach.  The crust was thin and crisp, but not like a cracker.  It still had some chewiness.  The aforementioned sauce and cheese went nearly out to edges of the pie.  The pizza was cut into squares and toppings were carefully and evenly applied.  The mushrooms were outstanding because they\'re the canned mushrooms that remain plump and juicy when cooking.  The bell peppers and ricotta cheese were OK, although the ricotta added even more sweetness.  One renegade black olive somehow made it on my pizza, which I found endearing.\n\nIf you\'re not in a pizza mood, they have a full menu with sandwiches, salads, calzones, etc.  They actually have a calzone stuffed with spaghetti.  On a previous visit, we ordered it just as a conversation topic, leading to jokes like "... so why are Americans getting fatter?"  I have to admit that the little carbohydrate bomb was pretty tasty.\n\nNothing was special about the restaurant itself.  (After all, it\'s a converted Chili\'s.)  But the pizza is special.  It\'s high quality and definitely distinctive, which is rare to say about pizza.', 'business_id': 'ZRJwVLyzEJq1VAihDhYiow', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2012-04-27', 'type': 'review'}

How can this be, you ask?  \n1.  The food I did get was really good.  \n2.  The Server and the Manager both personally came over and sincerely apologized to me.  They also tried their best to try to improve my total experience by offering an extra serving of what I really did order (to go) and an extra glass of wine (both of which I did not accept).\n3.  The restaurant comp\'ed my entire meal\n4.  My server even said he didn\'t expect any tip.  (I actually tipped him well)  \n\nI was in the Phoenix area for business, so I was dining alone.  Now, I hate eating out alone.  Luckily, I sat at one of the tables in the bar so I was entertained by the D-back\'s baseball game on all TVs.  I ordered a small Mamma\'s Signature Spinach Calzone with sausage added and a glass of wine.  I had been nursing my wine for quite a while (about 35-40 minutes) when my server approached and told me that he was really sorry about the long wait.  Something had gone wrong causing my order to be really delayed, but he said that the kitchen was finishing my calzone now.  Finally, he added that they\'d be comp-ing my wine because of the delay.\nI said, OK and sure enough, a few moments later, a calzone appeared.  I was starving by then and dug right in.  One bite into it, I realized that there was no spinach in this calzone--only sausage.  Although a little disappointed that I didn\'t get the "signature" item, the calzone was really good.  Yes, the sauce is a little sweet, but it\'s not as dramatic as some other yelpers make it out to be.  The outer crust on the calzone is firm, but maintains some softer "give" on the inside.  \n\nWhen the server came around to check on me, I mentioned that there was no spinach in the calzone and he turned a little white.  I\'m pretty sure that when he had re-entered my order he had forgotten that I had ordered the Singature spinach with Sausage.  Anyway, he immediately asked if I wanted it remade.  I declined since I was so hungry.  \n\nIn the end, I was very happy with the efforts made to make up for the various mistakes.  I think the fact that I did not flip out made them work all the harder to make amends.  I would go back in a heartbeat if only to try that Mamma\'s Signature Spinach!', 'business_id': 'ZRJwVLyzEJq1VAihDhYiow', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2012-05-09', 'type': 'review'}

My meal came with a greek salad.  The only thing greek about the salad was the feta cheese.   Greek salad shouldnt come with italian dressing.  \n\nI have had thier pizzas and they are good.

The staff is very friendly, we can recognize most of them but they usually don't remember us, which is fine.  The reason we used to come often is because we live within walking distance and it's convenient. \n\nWe really like the mama spinach pizza or combo pizza, the salads are good too. There are a few items such some salad dressing, a couple of pizza and a couple  pasta dishes we tried that we did not like at all. We have only stuck to pizzas' then. The thin crust is the one to eat, not the thick one. They only have pepsi products which is fine but we like Coke best. \n\nTheir sweet sauce is great. Some items are really good but some taste like from a can. Their canoli was decent for the first 3 times then they started coming either empty (no filing inside) or just tasting like a sweet cheese. So we don't do canoli's anymore but I know they cookies are good. \n\nTheir Gluten Free pizza is not very good a bit too expensive. Buon Gusto down the street has the best GF pizza and very reasonably priced.  Some of their staff is not well informed on Gluten free items or items in their menu. It's important for the staff to be knowledgeable when it comes to food allergy and the contents of the menu they work in. I would not trust GF items here as I didn't feel confident that they understand it.  \n\nWe think ourselves to be good clients as we sometimes eat here on a weekly basis.  But recently, I order a combo pizza with the thick crust (trying first time) and we did not like the crust at all. However, the main problem was that somehow there were two pieces of chicken bones about 2 inches long mixed in with the cheese and other veggies. My husband hurt his mouth with one of the hard chicken bone pieces. \n\nWe brought the entire pizza back (minus 2  1/2 slices) and they credited us the pizza and said a manager would call us next day. We never received a call or feedback. We never finished our lunch. We ended up after returning the pizza having to take the family to in-n-out as a fast solution since we had run out of lunch time. Very inconvenient to have to drive back to bring the pizza back and receive a half apology and then have to go find lunch somewhere else. \n\nWe haven't eaten there since then. :( \n\nPomo is the best pizza in Phoenix but way too far for us.

Almost as if he was annoyed at us for whatever reason.  Nothing really stood out to me on their menu, so I decided to play it safe and just go for a personal veggie pizza. I immediately regretted that decision. The dough that they use is really weird and was just off. It wasn\'t like any pizza dough I\'ve ever had. The pizza sauce is SWEET! What!?? Who does that?! Since when is pizza sauce supposed to be sweet? The veggies that were used are from a can. You read right. From a can. Shocking and disappointing. The pizza didn\'t taste good at all. I sent it back because there was no way I was going to eat that willingly. The waiter looked shocked that I didn\'t like it. Sorry bro. The manager comes out and wants to know why I sent it back and if there was something else I would like instead. That was a negative because that "candy" sauce is in everything I\'m sure.

We sat down and it took another 15 minutes for us to meet our waiter, and she didn\'t even introduce herself. In fact, we had to ask the servers at the front what her name was. I know it was busy, but she was only waiting us and one other table. She asked us what our drinks were with a look on her face that she did not want to be there. There was no "Hi, how are you doing? What would you like to drink?" It was just, " what do you want." No clarity or anything. After a lengthy amount of time she brought our drinks... Well most of them. She forgot 3 of them. We had to tell her she forgot some and then she brought again some of them. It took me asking 3 times and 45 minutes to get a simple glass of water. She later came and took our order, still with an angered face. She then put in our order. Well most of our order. She forgot my sisters order. She said "the kitchen forgot to make it." This was untrue, because of the receipt it said "on the fly" meaning she forgot to input the order. When it finally came out after we were all done eating, she said "here." With an angry tone and dropped the pizza on the table while nearing hitting my sisters head with it. The only good part of the experience was the food and the staff up front (even though it took awhile it wasn\'t their fault). I have gone there 3 times this year. Hoping it would be better. It wasn\'t. This is compared to the like thirty times last year. \n\nTL;DR (Too long; didn\'t read) The service sucked, pizza was good. All in all, bring back Bobby Carzoo.

The Ahwatukee Spinato's is a pretty nice location but the best part is that we live within their delivery range so we can get their yummy pizza whenever we want! They do have a delivery fee of $2.50 and it usually takes 45 minutes to an hour to get the pizza. So, not quite as convenient as Pizza Hut or other chains but they do have the fancy online ordering available on their website so that is pretty cool.\n\nThey offer both a thick crust which they call Sicilian style and a thin crust. The thick crust pizza is sort of like Chicago style but not really since it is not so heavily loaded with cheese and toppings. It is a lot of bread but so yummy. My favorite pizzas are the Here's the Beef (steak, caramelized onions, and Gorgonzola, yum!) and the Margherita but those are both good for the thin crust. Since the hubby likes the thicker crust we usually get it with half the Signature (garlic sauteed spinach-so good!) and then half the Combo or Chicago (both have Italian sausage and lots of veggies). I've also tried the Canadian and that was amazing, too. It works pretty well with the pineapple because their sauce is somewhat on the sweeter side.

I don't think the sweet sauce works with every pizza, though. \n\nI would not recommend any of the pastas. The quality is not great, and the pasta is usually a bit more undercooked than al dente. Go for the pizza instead. \n\nFor starters, the spinach artichoke dip is a must, but in my opinion always comes with way more dip than bread. The meatball trio was also good, if you're on a date (it's pretty small). \n\nThe signature thin crust pizza is the way to go. I think they are perfectly cooked and crispy. While the sauce is a bit too sweet, it's still tasty. \n\nThe service is alright. Sometimes super slow, sometimes on point.

My husband lemonade that was super concentrated, we had to water it with other two glasses of plain water to be drinkable, and he also ordered Cajun Chicken Pasta which had too much oil and look like soup instead of pasta and was bland.

I chalked it up to the server maybe just having a bad day. Over the weekend we tried to eat here again. Well this time the service was ok. Just ok. Nothing special. The server didn't really seem too happy to be serving us. I'm pretty picky about service because my fianc\xe9 and I seem to get a long really well and have a friendship with the employees of the restaurants we frequent the most. The server wasn't too friendly and made us feel like we inconvenienced him by asking for a tiny loaf of bread to go ten minutes before they close. So what. It's bread. Deal with it. Anyways onto the food. I got pizza and I would say their pizza is pretty unique. The sauce stood out which is rare for a pizza place. Even after eating the leftovers the next day I couldn't decide if I like the sauce being so sweet or if it handicaps the pizza. Overall though the pizza was really delicious and I tore it up. The house bread with butter is a good starter.  The restaurant is nice. Some of the other employees around were friendly just not our server so much. I will go back again though in hopes that we finally find a server who is friendly because the food is good enough to make me want to go back.

Nevertheless, our server took good care of us when we were seated. \n\nI got the combo on gluten free crust, which was really delicious.

My mom got the pear & pecan salad, which she expressed was good with a slightly "sour" taste to it (the good kind of "sour"). \n\nThe only downside of Spinato\'s was the wait time for the food - we didn\'t really mind waiting to be seated but we were very hungry by the time the food came around. It took about 40 minutes for two pizzas and a salad, and it was a challenge to entertain my sister\'s two hungry and tired toddlers during that time. Although they were given kids\' menus with crayons, they showed little interest... because they were hungry. My mom commented that it may have been better to order ahead for a pickup and eat at home, especially in consideration of the children. If you\'re hungry, I recommend getting an appetizer to munch on while you wait. \n\nBottom line: great pizza, yummy salad, lots of GF options. Good service.

I\'ve had spinatos before at the office courtesy of my coworkers. \n\nThe place was clean and we had a big party in the back room and a lot of traffic wasn\'t walking behind us so I didn\'t have to worry about anyone making me scoot my chair in as I\'m on the edge of my seat waiting for PIZZA! \n\nThe pizza is awesome it never disappoints. \nWe had some pepperoni pizza, some meaty pizza w peppers and even a gluten free pizza and honestly I would eat that gluten free pizza all day. It was thin and crispy and held up the toppings well!\n\nPer person we spent about $12-$15 total but my family are hearty eaters. Heck a child in our family can clear half a medium pizza and wings. Yes yes we\'re working on child obesity in the US don\'t worry.\n\nI dabbled in everyone\'s food as I always do. I had artichoke stuffed mushrooms with pancetta on top. I really liked the saltiness of the pancetta cutting in with the mushrooms, cheese and artichoke. It was a good idea.\n\nWe also tried pasta. The spaghetti w marinara was ok the house sausage added was too done almost burnt - I suppose some may appreciate that & the noodles felt cold against the warm marinara. One thing I don\'t like about pasta is it being rolled in olive oil before served. That tells me it\'s not fresh and pre cooked and sat a while and it tasted like it. I will pass on any pasta dish in the future bc what others ordered didn\'t look impressive either.\n\nLastly the calzone. We got a Chicago steak calzone which is served with au jus n I added sweet peppers. It was so so. The crust was actually the best part whereas the filling was just meh. I will pass on the steak calzones but maybe I\'d try a sandwich next time. I\'m sure a diff combination would be good maybe pesto or something would have gave it that wow! \n\nThe service was great, our waiter attentive and I never complain when we come w more than 5 people bc I feel more sorry for the staff than us. He brought out a free cannoli for the birthday boy also which he enjoyed saying, "it was good and it was sweet too." \n\nDo I recommend spinatos? Of course their pizza is out of this world. My kids are very picky about their pizza (they didn\'t get that from me...maybe) but they loved spinatos pizza and devoured it like cavemen. \n\nThe only reason it didn\'t get my 5 star review was because of how some of our food turned out.  Parts were done extremely well and others were meh. I don\'t like feeling meh. I even took the pasta home to let the noodles soak up the sauce and you know how spaghetti is awesome the day after? I was still meh.', 'business_id': 'ZRJwVLyzEJq1VAihDhYiow', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2015-07-05', 'type': 'review'}

There's a few pizzas that are on special, and there are drink specials and a few appetizer specials.\n\nHubby wanted the cheese bread (despite my trying to talk him into the meatballs) and it was better than expected for $3 bucks. The bread was a PERFECT blend of soft, but toasted, chewy crunchy deliciousness topped with a quality mozzarella, perfectly melted and sprinkled with Italian herbs. The marinara was sweet, which we weren't complaining about! You need sweet to cut the acidity in the tomatoes. \n\nOn to pizza. Hubs got the Canadian, which is pineapple and Canadian bacon. It was very good, although for some reason his crust wasn't as crispy as mine-not bad at all, just an observation. I think the flavors in the crust and sauce are pretty darn good. POSSIBLY too much sauce on the Canadian pineapple one... Only because the pineapple is sweet, then the sauce is sweet, I think it was literally just a hair oversweet. Just a hair! Still very very good!\n\nI was feeling adventurous! So I tried the special, the sausage and fennel with balsamic glaze. DYNAMITE. sometimes you just get a menu item that is PERFECTLY balanced with several real strong flavors put together, and it works. The glaze really just finished it off with the bow-chicka-bow-wow factor. And my pizza was crisp, the slices did not bend when picked up. Come to think of it, there's no red sauce on that one... Which is probably why it was much more crisp. Perhaps we'll ask for light sauce next time we order the Canadian.\n\nGO. EAT.

Now year\'s later, I work right down the street from the Ahwatukee location and STILL remain a loyal, faithful customer who is convinced that you just can\'t order anything like it anywhere else. My first experience was the famous spinach pizza. I can honestly tell you, I had never eaten spinach before and had I not tried that slice, I may never have! Today I like to try different pizzas as well as their other dishes too. Tonight I ordered the Nicole\'s favorite but I get it with ricotta instead of feta cheese. Oh mah gah! So amazing! Calzones are huge and so soft and fresh. Salads are perfect. I can\'t think of anything this place can\'t make right! If you are looking for something south of Bianco and with a twist, check it out.

Go cheggit out of course !!!!\n\nThey have Peroni on tap which is a plus. A great Italian beer that I love. After 4 peroni\'s I\'m writing this review so u all know the truth always comes out when u got a good buzz kakakakakaka. \n\nPlace is very clean. Service is excellent. Now for the nitty gritty. Ordered the meatball trio and garlic bread with mozzarella cheese on top. Both were pretty dammmmmmmm guuuuuuuuuud, I must say. I\'m a sucka for meatballs n sausage n this place delivers on the meatballs lol. \n\nOrdered the "got meat" thin crust pizza. Pizza came out great !!! However, too much meat on my thin crust pizza that it kinda weighed it down, but u know wat, who the buck cares lol. Pizza tasted great !!! The marinara sauce is a bit in the sweet side which I\'m not used to but overall it was a good pizza. \n\nActually ordered a shietload of food that I cannot finish. But u know wat, I had to try a bit of as much as I could to write this review for u guys n gals. \n\nAll in all, pizza not as good as Grimaldi\'s (IMO) but they definitely hold their own. I would definitely return for the food, customer service, atmosphere anddddddddddddddddd I ran out of ideas LOL !!!!!! So come on by if you\'re in the area.', 'business_id': 'ZRJwVLyzEJq1VAihDhYiow', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2015-11-05', 'type': 'review'}

The sauce is so yummy. Food is fresh and very tasty. Their pizzas are terrific but their sandwiches and pastas are also very, very good.

Their pizza is no comparison to any other pizza I've tasted. I also tried their appetizer it was bread with melted cheese idk what it was called but it was amazing!!!! And my awesome waiter convinced me to try their cannoli and man it was soooo good and I'm not a fan of chocolate (shocker, I know) but it was so good and I paired it with their vanilla gelato and I left their extremely satisfied. Not only was the food amazing but our server Brandon was phenomenal I can't wait to go back!", 'business_id': 'ZRJwVLyzEJq1VAihDhYiow', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2015-12-03', 'type': 'review'}
