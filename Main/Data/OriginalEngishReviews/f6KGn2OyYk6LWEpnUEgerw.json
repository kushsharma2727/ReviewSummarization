It\'s a little  confusing to see Hawaiian names and foods next to Caribbean names and foods, but as Chris Rock would say - it\'s all right cause it\'s all white!  The quality of food is so-so, nothing to write home to ma.  Location is prime...I think TI is one of the better hotels destinations on the strip - huge parking garage, convenient location (near the highway on ramp), close to the gigantic mall, nice theme, good club (Tangerine)...but I digress.\n\nSo Kahunaville will try it\'s damnedest to entertain the crap out of you while you eat.  In a less than intrusive way, which I appreciated.  We ordered a couple of the sample appetizer plates which came with a fake volcano and deco pieces.  Every 45 minutes or so, they would dim the lights for the water show I\'ll call Baby Bellagio.  There\'s girls walking around in coconut bras, asking people if they want to get "lei\'d" for $20...which is the cheapest lay on the Strip.  And of course, the professional bartender show, which gets everyone in a Spring-Break woo-hoo frame of mind.  Remember visiting Cancun for spring break, partying hard at the bars with Mexican dudes whistling and pouring drinks into half-naked girls\' mouths?  Well, take away the Mexican dudes and add a little more clothes to the girls...that\'s what it was like :)', 'business_id': 'f6KGn2OyYk6LWEpnUEgerw', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2007-03-27', 'type': 'review'}

The added bonus is if you\'re at the bar, at the end of the magnificent show, the bartender picks several ppl on his side (there are 3 sides) who he thinks were the loudest/funnest/whatever and they get one of the several shooters he just poured *for free*.

I can honestly say that the guys performing the dueling pianos were horrible.  So horrible that not even consuming additional quantities of alcohol could make them any better.  Go to New York, New York on the other end of the Strip for a decent piano bar.  We next stopped in on Thursday before heading out to some clubs.  We decided to try out the Kahunaville Oxygen bar which is located up front.  Never tried an oxygen bar before but it was only $20.00 for 20 minutes so we gave it a shot.  I guess it's supposed to give you energy and/or make you feel good inhaling the O2 (oxygen).  There were also different scents mixed in while hooked up.  A head and back massage by the female bartender using some strange contraption for the head and a three roller thing for the back was also included.

Need I say more? \nSeriously, I ordered the plainest margarita they had and it was still too sweet to drink\nIt was in our hotel, so the number of men trying to follow the 21 year old twin girls back to our room were numerous and hard to shake\n\nI wouldn\'t go back there again because it\'s just not my scene, but the girls enjoyed it and we got many a drink for free (even if I couldn\'t actually stomach them) so it seems like a place to go for some harmless dancin\' and drinkin\' fun - especially if you\'re under 25 and enjoy super cheese.', 'business_id': 'f6KGn2OyYk6LWEpnUEgerw', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2008-10-07', 'type': 'review'}

On a different day we decided to check it out since we had never done the oxygen thing before, but just felt really uncomfortable the entire time. The girl that worked the bar was really weird, fake, and over friendly. For 20 bucks you get use of the oxygen tanks (they have 4 different flavors to chose from, but they all just smell like a weird sweet plastic smell) you get a massage from the girl, and you get a monster energy drink. For some people I can see how they would think this was fun and a pretty sweet deal, but we just felt awkward and skipped out before she could come massage us! Didn't go for the energy drink either, but only because we don't like the taste.

Here's the reason why:\n\nI love calamari. In fact, I consider myself a snob when it comes to this dish. Living in Las Vegas these past couple years, I was getting fearful I would never taste good calamari again. Then I went to Kahunaville! Awesome dish. I think what makes it soo good is the tangy sauce that comes with it. Yummie! Also, the drinks are not that bad either. I ordered a margharita specifically the way I like it (skinny girl style) and it was made perfectly. My friends also enjoyed the speciality drinks from the menu while we were there. \n\nHowever...\nThe speciality drinks were way overpriced. Also, while there for dinner with my friends (same mentioned above), we had a confusing and baffling experience which brings the rating of this place down in my mind. One of my friends is pregnate and therefore watching what she is eating. That night, she ordered the nachos, which she had been craving. When placing the order, she requested the peppers and olives be on the side. Also she asked that the gouda cheese not be included. When the dish came, it was exactly as described in the menu but not as she had ordered. Good thing she and her husband had also ordered a plate of chicken wings. The waitress was wonderful to take the plate of nachos back to the kitchen to get the order corrected. BUT she then returned w/. strange news-  the kitchen refused to change the order. \n\nI have never been to a restaurant that would not be willing to give a customer what they wanted. The cheeses apparently were pre-mixed. No problem for my friend. But the kitchen still refused to serve the peppers and olives on the side. My friend canceled the nachos order and instead decided to get french fries. A half hour later and the rest of us (a total of 6 people in our party) were finished with our plates and the fries had still not arrived. When all was said and done, my friends paid more for the 1 speciality drink (they got a free plastic cup- whoopie!) than for their meal-- one plate of chicken wings.\n\nTherefore, I give this restaurant 3 stars:\nGreat calamari and margharita\nHorrible kitchen service and overpriced drinks. Oh yeah- the plastic cup was tacky as well. \n\nMy advice- only go here for the appetizers and a couple of drinks but nothing else.", 'business_id': 'f6KGn2OyYk6LWEpnUEgerw', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2009-03-03', 'type': 'review'}

It was the last night of four that my buddies and I were staying in April 2009. The girl working there hooked us up to a few of those oxygen tubes and gave us a shot of flavored vodka (Smirnoff shot bottle of your choice) and a can of Monster to dump it in. It was kinda funny in the sense that here we are trying to get over our hangovers and they just give us more liquor, but it is Vegas, lol. \n\nAfter inhaling and exhaling for a few minutes, she gave each of us back massages with some sort of vibrating massage device. My buddies and I sipped on our drinks and talked while she made her rounds on us. The oxygen flavors came in four which you breathe simultaneously. You could turn down the notch of one flavor so you could smell another one a bit better. Honestly, I couldn't really tell the difference between any of them. After the massages she would use a tingly wire device to massage our heads.\n\nLater during the massage, a cute little girl in a little Hula costume of some sort came around selling lays and beads. We bought some and socialized a bit and then it was over. The overall experience was just ok because it was my second oxygen bar during the trip and I had a better one to compare it to.\n\nIf you want to visit a kick ass oxygen bar, go to the one at Fashion Show Mall, they explain more of the devices that they use and do a few extra things (no, not what you're thinking, lol) including a small wired machine that stimulates your muscles and scented oils you can inhale.

On our first night in town, instead of hitting up a nightclub, we opted to go to Kahunaville for drinks. It's always a party at K-Ville. Between the flair bartenders, the live band, karaoke, tropical inspired cocktails and music/music videos, I always have fun.\n\nThey have an extensive drink menu with speciality cocktails. Frozen margaritas (complete with gummy worm garnish), huge smoking cocktails served in a glass bigger than my head, or even just beer or a well drink, they got something for everyone. My friends even asked the bartender for a cup of gummy worms and they hooked it up. My favorite cocktail is the Luau Lemonade. It taste exactly like cherry lemonade from Hot Dog on a Stick. I kid you not. It's made with citrus vodka and some other mixers. Don't be fooled by the great tasting cocktails, they do creep up on you. A few rounds later we were all pretty drunk and having a blast. The live band sang a weird but fun mix of songs (from Usher and Snoop Dog to George Clinton) and they definitely kept the party going. \n\nThere's also a restaurant located in the back. The menu is like a Island T.G.I.Fridays. While the food in the restaurant was a bit overpriced and had small portions, the bar itself is worth a visit. \n\nIf you're in Vegas and don't feel like dressing up to go to a crowded nightclub, head over to Kahunaville, sit back, order a few cocktails and enjoy the show.

OK what ever... we stood at the podium, and we stood some more; finally 15minutes went by and we got our name on a list along with 1 other couple; the third was told to wait. Every few minutes someone would come up and look at the list and run away. We left after 30 minutes. Later that day we complained to the manager who met us at the front desk, she seemed very nice but was one of the people who was providing poor service that morning. She claimed that it was abnormal since she had 3 employees call in sick that day and invited us to return, a meal on her to receive great service that they\'re known for... boy was I an idiot to accept. We went in the next morning, and though we were sat quickly we saw our waitress 3 times... she took our order, she dropped off our food, then she dropped off our bill. A coffee carafe means, I DO NOT have to come back to fill your mug or talk to you again, and after having sat there for 10min after my food was delivered to inform the waitress my steak and eggs breakfast was wrong is pathetic. The eggs which were ordered Over Medium, had very little yoke on one egg, the other was NONE, the Steak which was ordered Well Done was dark on the outside but bloody rare on the inside... basically grill was way too hot and it burned the outside while the inside of my steak was cold and VERY red. I was told they could re-fire it, but what\'s the point of throwing a burnt raw steak on a grill? How does that solve it? I told the waitress not to worry about it, wasn\'t her fault even though she should have known by looking at it something was wrong, and should have informed the cook not to give her that crap. We didn\'t pay for our meal, but the manager never stopped by to make sure we were taken care of based on our first horrible attempt to visit, and the staff was running around completely lost, I saw 8 tables inside, and two wait staff plus 1 hostess who\'s entire plan to seat people was "This way" then walk as quickly to a table as she could, drop the menus off then abruptly leave, most the customers couldn\'t keep up with her. The food here is fairly pricey, the service is downright rude if not generally nonexistent and the cooks probably couldn\'t handle a hungry-man TV dinner in a microwave.\n\nConstantly you\'ll see women in Hawaiin clothing trying to give away coupons for free drinks and money off your meal, they do this because once you go there you\'ll not want to return.', 'business_id': 'f6KGn2OyYk6LWEpnUEgerw', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2010-08-26', 'type': 'review'}

BAD!\n\nWe were lured in by the infamous coupons handed out at the bottom of the escalators leading in to TI from the tram stop. The original plan was to head over to RA sushi for happy hour, but the convenience of not having to walk over the bridge in the cold lead us in, against our better judgment.\n\nHostess = very rude. This should have been warning enough to turn around and leave. We were ignored for a few minutes before being lead to our table, were we then waited another 10 minutes for our equally rude waitress to acknowledge our presence, breaking the news:\n\nAlthough though the coupon girl assured us that we - party of 5 - could each use one of the free drink  or  2-for-1 drink offers she handed us, we found that not to be the case once inside. One free drink coupon OR the 2-for-1 entree coupon would have to be shared amongst us. Bait and switch much? especially because she made it a point to hand each of us our own pile of worthless paper. We should have left then...\n\nBecause we had a guest-list invite across town, and didn\'t want to waste anymore time walking in heels to find another dinner spot, we stuck around in the interest of saving time. BIG MISTAKE. After dropping the no-coupon bomb on our table, the very rude waitress disappeared for another 10 minutes - at this point I should mention that we were 1 of about 3 parties in the whole place, and there was another waitress working in addition to bar tenders, and bussers - Growing impatient, we ordered our own drinks from the bar and brought them back to the table, using a 2-for-1 and a free drink coupon amongst 3 of us. We got back to the table and the waitress, seeing our drinks, rolled her eyes sarcastically snapping at us "I see you\'re all set on drinks". we should have left then, but of course, didn\'t. Rude waitress proceeded to take our order for two entrees and an appetizer to be split. She disappears for another 10 minutes.   \n\nUpon returning, the waitress hands us a check for just the appetizer, and tells us that she\'s clocking out and the bar will be handling our order from here on out. I would later find out that we had reached the transition from full menu to "late night $5 menu"  in the 45+ minutes we had spent waiting around inside the restaurant.  Puzzled, I went up to the bartender we had ordered our drinks from and explained that we were confused as to what happened with our entrees (whether or not they were still available, or if the order had been put in etc) and then told him "it\'s no big deal, we\'ll order a few more $5 appetizers, if that\'s all that\'s available". The bartender had NO clue as to what was going on and said he\'d find his manager to "take care of it" \n\n"finally" I thought, "someone who can figure this all out" \n\nBy the time the manager made it to our table, we had been waiting in the restaurant for nearly an hour. Our appetizer (the nachos, which weren\'t half bad, but definitely not enough to split 5 ways) had arrived via another waitress who - not surprisingly - had no clue as to what had happened to our entree order and couldn\'t help us with ordering more appetizers. Keeping with, what I can only assume now is company policy for staff/customer relations, the manager was extremely rude. We explained the situation, told him we were in a hurry, and that we didn\'t care if we got the entrees or not but did need to feed everyone in our group asap - as we had a set time to meet a promoter. We got a short and annoyed response from the manager, who said he\'d check it out and be right back, which he was 5 minutes later to let us know the entrees were on the way. "great" I though...\n\nFast forward nearly 30 minutes later, and STILL no entrees. Most annoyingly, the original waitress who was helping us had walked past our table 4 or 5 times while helping rope off the area we\'re still sitting in STARVING. Our single appetizer was gone, our mediocre drinks were gone, and we decided to follow suit. On the way out the door, the manager blocked our path, saying, in a Creepy Mc Creeperton tone "where are you going, your entrees will be out in 2 minutes". Another party member - fed up - reminded him that we\'d been waiting 45 minutes since our "waitress" took  said order, pushing past, as I barked over my shoulder "I\'m totally yelping this B.S."\n\nso here I am... \n\n1)  I know this wasn\'t indented to be a gourmet dining experience.\n2)  Yes, I know it\'s at T.I.\n3)  I\'m aware of regular coupon policies.  \n\nbut seriously!\n\nPressed for time, we ended up having a taxi driver drop us off at Sonic across the street from The Palms.

The chicken was just alright. I am pretty sure it was pre-cooked chicken strips (a la Perdue) and the broth was chock full of tomato chunks. I didn't notice any other veggie. The broth was flavorful, but the soup itself lacked substance. \n\nFor cocktails, I ordered the All Mix'd Up drink - it was a mix of flavored vodka with cranberry juice and soda water I believe. Yum. My girlfriend had the Otter Pop. It tasted just like an Otter Pop - super sugary and sweet.\n\nMy girlfriend had the hamburger sliders. These were DELISH.

We had just finished a wonderful brunch some where else and came here for the drinks. Our friend had just purchased a Travelzoo Voucher where for $25 you get 6 drinks plus a free bartender show. Since we had arrived early, we thought we were not going to be able to see it because it only occurs a few times in the evening. Anyhow, $25 for 6 drinks is phenominal. We were initially greeted by a very nice hostess named Meena (I don't know how to spell her name, but she is the girlfriend of the bartender named Steve who we would meet later on in the evening) Our bartender Evan was quite nice to us. We were just drinking away having great conversation with each other while playing video blackjack on the tables.\n\nI really think too that especially if you are a hot female, you will be treated very well at this bar. Well, we finished our 6 drinks and started to meander around the casino. Well, my friend decides to use the restroom adjacent to the restaurant and she noticed that there was the bartender bottle show. She went back inside and this marketing manager of the bar named Lenny greets her. Our friend tells us to go back to the bar and we have more cocktails. We met Steve the bartender who is the girlfriend of the hostess that we met earlier. The girlfriends who were with me challenged Steve to show us his abs. Well, eventually he did and he did not disappoint with the washboard abs. This is a very laid back bar that had a very friendly vibe to it. I mean we actually interacted with many of the staff here because they were just so nice. We would definitely return back here again.", 'business_id': 'f6KGn2OyYk6LWEpnUEgerw', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2012-03-12', 'type': 'review'}

But, the dining room has a little fountain show that plays every hour, which is pretty neat - think tiny-scale, primitive Bellagio fountains.\n\nMy friend and I ordered the Surf's Up salad which was made up of iceberg lettuce, shredded cheddar, tomatoes, red onions, cucumbers and croutons (she also got chicken on hers). And these salads... they were HUGE! We could barely finish them! I think the best part was the croutons because they were very flavorful.\n\nOur other friend got the Skinny Dip which is a roast beef sandwich topped with mozzarella and provolone cheese, horseradish sauce and served with au jus to dip it in. It also came with french fries which were thin cut, very crispy and DELICIOUS (I know because I stole a few).\n\nAnd last but not least, our other friend got the Big Kahuna Cheeseburger which was topped with American cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and pickles. He seemed to like it a lot, which is always a good thing. (He opted to get a salad instead of fries which I think is a travesty)\n\nI'm glad to say that the great food and extremely reasonable prices made up for the hostesses' lame attitude.

First of all I think I was instantly turned off that this Hawaiian themed restaurant had about 0% of Aloha in their menu....I mean I wasn't expecting an authentic hawaiian meal but I was thinking there would be some sort of commercialized Panda Express/Bahama Breeze attempt at it? Or even a few Musubi's would have shut me up when it comes to questioning why this place went with a Hawaiian theme....but seriously the only Aloha in this place was the jungle print menu...that being said they could add a few more fish tanks and called this place the Rain Forest Cafe. However there is two reasons why I ended up here as many times (3 times to be exact) as I did and thats because I was staying in treasure Island and I had a coupon. \n\nI've been to plenty of restaurants where service is non existent and it doesn't bother me because usually there is some yummy food that more than makes up for it. I understand why some places may not have the best of service for reasons such as being understaffed, cultural differences (In some cultures if a waitress is constantly coming to your table it means they want you to leave rather than enjoy your food & chat with your party), or just simply not well trained. However when it comes to a Chain like restaurant in a Casino one would think that basics courtesy would be the standard? Not for 2 out of my 3 experience\n\nMy first experience our waitress seemed to be....off in her own world? the place wasn't busy at all but she seemed preoccupied with something ....just not sure what it was. The plastic cups for our beverages was kind of a turn off as well. My Chicken burger was super dry and all the kahuna bbq sauce in the world could not save it...and believe me I TRIED SO HARD! lol\n\nThe 2nd time I came here for a drink and the bartender literally took 10 minutes to get to me because he was dancing behind the counter? and the place was dead with only like 3 people sitting at the bar. When the bartender finally took my drink order he totally got it wrong because I wanted one of those cool long margarita glasses and instead got a 10 oz disposable cup......fail....\n\nMy last experience was breakfast out by the pool....this experience was a lot better! The food was good, our server was actually happy to see us, and made an effort to make us feel welcomed.\n\nall in all my last experience is the only reason this place got two stars instead of one....however if you don't have a coupon there are better places on the strip to spend your money.", 'business_id': 'f6KGn2OyYk6LWEpnUEgerw', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2012-03-28', 'type': 'review'}

Considering the restaurant was practically empty we figured they were just understaffed that morning.  When we were finally seated our waitress was fairly attentive.  She was clearly overwhelmed with the number of tables she was taking care of.\n\nOrdered orange juice and I'm pretty sure it was from a frozen can.  I've had better from McDonald's.  My husband ordered a bloody mary which he loved, but it was ~$9.  The actual food was fine.  The breakfast potatoes were the best part.  Toast wasn't bad either.  Eggs were standard as was the sausage patties.  My husband ordered white toast which was actually Texas Toast which he liked.  He also asked if he could have Chorizo sausage for the same price and they said yes.  He was pretty excited about that too.\n\nAll in all there's nothing wrong with Kahunaville.  On the same note there's nothing spectacular about it either.  Service was a little slow but I'm assuming everything is in Vegas before noon.

Thank you Kahunaville Management Team.\n____\n\nYack, wretch, what the hell are these people thinking??  I couldn\'t find the "no star" option, so I\'ll stick with one.\n\nWhere do I begin.....\n\nLate lunch, not very busy, we were seated in the bar area at a table in the back.\n\nOrdered the wedge salad, nachos and the sandwich sampler.\n\nWaited for quite a while for the wedge salad to appear, when it did, there was a metal screw in it, stuck to the blue cheese dressing.  I have no idea where in the heck this metal screw could have come from, but had I not seen it before ingesting, it could have been very upsetting.  That, along with the fact that I couldn\'t see any green under the mound of dressing, I asked for the replacement salad to have dressing on the side.  I guess the fact that the salad was drowned in dressing made it much easier to identify the metal screw.  \n\nDidn\'t finish the salad.  Was not good, red iceberg lettuce, clearly had been out for a while... Forgave the salad and waited for the rest our food FOREVER.\n\nWhen the sandwich sampler finally came out, at least 30 minutes after the salad (it\'s been about an hour overall) the so-called food on the plate was practically unrecognizable.  The sandwich buns were so hard you could throw them at a wall and see a dust cloud.  I had to point with my fork at items, and look to my wife to decipher what was on the plate.   We could barely identify the solidified pork ball with a white substance on top, but the other items, where a slather of gravy was involved, we can\'t tell you what it was. Maybe some dried up meat bits? a fried piece of something? all that and the fries were dried out and dark brown.  The nachos had the lowest quality cheese sauce on them possible and that coupled with the chef boyardee "chili meat" made us both say, that\'s it! We\'re outta here!\n\nI get it people, this primarily a bar, where people would primarily order bar food.  I love bars.  I love bar food.  This is not bar food, this is BARF FOOD.\n\nNow folks, I\'m a big hearty kind of guy.  I\'m not that picky about my food, but this was the first time, in my entire 41 years on this planet, that I actually left without eating a bite. My wife wanted to just walk out, but for karma\'s sake, I spent the next 10 minutes trying to find our server to pay for this horrific meal, so we could leave.  When she finally came to our table, do you think she asked why we were leaving two entire plates of food? drum rollllllllllll  nope! She just said, hey have a good day.  \n\nGross.', 'business_id': 'f6KGn2OyYk6LWEpnUEgerw', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2012-05-27', 'type': 'review'}

It tasted like a store bought chicken patty covered with store bought sauce, and topped with a little mozzarella cheese melted at the last minute.     \n\nThroughout our time there, our buy one get one free drink voucher sat in plain view on the table, however our waitress NEVER ASKED US what we would like.  I actually had to ask her of we could order a drink!  \n\nThis place has an EXTENSIVE tropical drink menu with not a single price on it.  With some research I found that the average drink on that menu is about $18!  So your "free" drink will cost you at least $9 if you order off the menu.  My wife ordered a Pina Colada and I had a Vodka Gimlet.  The gimlet was good but my wife said that the PC, the drink they discounted, was way too sweet and way too weak and she didn\'t finish it.   \n\nAfter serving our food, our waitress never came back to check on us, NEVER refilled our water and would not even make eye contact with us!  I actually had to call her attention to us just to get some water!\n\nThis restaurant looks and feels great.  The food presentation is very unique with dry ice "smoking" coconuts or volcano\'s on some dishes.  The food itself is ok but certainly not worth the price they charge.  It is rather expensive and the service was TERRIBLE!  This could be a really cool place if it operated on the premise of serving a quality experience rather than draining your wallet.\n\nEdit:\nMy wife wanted me to point out that when she ordered the Pina Colada, she ordered it made with Malibu Rum, what she got was the sugary , pre-made cocktails they have in the machines.  \n\nOnce again the waitress got our order WRONG!', 'business_id': 'f6KGn2OyYk6LWEpnUEgerw', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2012-06-06', 'type': 'review'}

I had the pina colada chicken and I thought it was very good. The coconut and pineapple sauce was just right, not overpowering. The chicken was breaded, but not dry or tough. The hibachi veggies were julienned and very delicious. My daughter had the chicken parm and she said it was okay...the pasta that came with it was very bland.

We had tried to get in to a couple of other restaurants beforehand, but after being told that there was an hour wait at them we kept on walking.

A couple of hands of the almost broken and booze covered video poker at the bar and 20 minutes later I enquired about our table and we were told that they had called our name and we hadn't answered. They knew we were at the bar (only a few paces away) so they couldn't have tried too hard to find us. A minute later the group sitting next to us at the bar had the exact same thing happen.\n\nAfter our table was cleared up a couple of minutes later we quickly ordered a couple of margaritas, which came out with snake lollies in them and were quite nice! A few more of these and we'd forget about the issues getting a table. Unfortunately service was very swamped and getting one more drink, let alone a few more, was almost impossible. \n\nFoodwise, my wife had a Summer salad, that seemed almost impossible to get without meat, but was huge and quite tasty. I had a pretty massive burger (of course I did!) though I really can't remember which one it was now (our visit here was quite a while ago now).\n\nAll in all Kahunaville made an okay choice for a rushed dinner with little other options around but I doubt we'll return.", 'business_id': 'f6KGn2OyYk6LWEpnUEgerw', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2012-12-04', 'type': 'review'}

Cousin and cousin\'s husband had arrived the night before us, walked past Kahunaville, heard the general party atmosphere commotion coming from within, and determined this might be a good spot to spend some time and money. Boy were they wrong.\n\nI don\'t know what was happening the night before, but when we came it was dead. Granted it was early, only about 8:00 or so, but it was a Friday night and we wanted to have fun. The atmosphere is cheesy, reminded me of a Rainforest Caf\xe9 but more sleazy, at first I thought it WAS a Rainforest Caf\xe9, ha ha ha... \n\nWe sat down at the bar and the bartenders outnumbered us. Several of them seemed busy, serving the few customers other than us around the bar. Then our bartender came over, who didn\'t appear to have any customers as yet, so you would think he\'d be happy for the business, but instead gave us an attitude like we were disrupting his relaxation time. My girlfriend asked what he would recommend from the drink menu, which is her MO as she generally doesn\'t bother with making decisions in unfamiliar territory and relies on what the employees like. Instead of naming off a few drinks or his favorite, or heck, the most expensive thing on the menu because if he\'d had the brains to say it she probably would have just bought it, he made some snarky comment about reading the menu. Okay dude, you are on the clock right? Like, this is your job, right? So she ordered a shooter and a margarita, which was overpriced and she said it wasn\'t that great. Her cousin ordered a flamboyant purple drink that came in a big fishbowl souvenir cup and was smoking with dry ice. It looked really cool and was a big hit but of course was overpriced. Don\'t know what the husband ordered. For my part I ordered a Monster in the can, which cost $7.00. Outrageous. \n\nOn top of that, he mocked my GF\'s cousin when he asked how we\'d like the bill, she clearly stated and gestured that she and her husband would be together. I\'m hearing impaired and I could hear her say it, two people down the bar. He copied her gesture and said "I don\'t know what this means," all snippy. All four of us looked at each other like, What\'s this guy\'s problem? Did we mistakenly end up at Dicks?  We are literally his only customers! I guess he was either having a bad night or just doesn\'t like making money. He didn\'t get any of ours.\n\nIt was so awkward after that, we left. I guess the angry bartender had the night off the previous night, because he was clearly not bringing the party on Friday. So we went somewhere else. None of us will be back.', 'business_id': 'f6KGn2OyYk6LWEpnUEgerw', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2013-01-17', 'type': 'review'}

The tackier the better in some parts. And you know what? Vegas is one of those places where the tackier the better can work. Can. Not does, definitively. Just can. \n\nKahunaville has a pretty decent bar- don\'t get me wrong. Yes, drinks are pricey, but more often times than not there are cute girls passing out BOGO drink coupons so that can help. They do some really fun tropical drinks, and I\'m kind of a rum fiend so I really had a blast. My personal favorite was the rock candy mango mojito. I love me some mango! And yes, the bartenders do tricks and do all the cool throwing tricks and fun stuff like that. As far as the bar goes, I dig it. There\'s gambling machines in the bar and drinks are fruity and fun. A good vacation bar. About every hour there is a small "tsunami" that goes on which consists of lowering lights, sounds, doing some flashing lights, and a small water fountain show. Kinda cool, but gets annoying the second time it happens. \n\nAs for the restaurant, my girlfriend and I were slightly less than impressed. We had the groupon deal for two house salads and two entrees. The entrees were only covered up to $23.99, and about 2/3 of the entree menu worked for that. I hate when they do groupons but end up doing upcharges because they barely cover anything. So that was good.\n\nI started with a ceasar, pretty standard. My friend got a house salad that was swimming in honey mustard. We also shared a bowl of the crab bisque which was absolutely the best thing I\'ve had there food wise. It was just... omg. I loved the crab bisque so much I contemplated getting another bowl. Like a chump I held out til my entree came then was too full to get another bowl.\n\nMy girlfriend got the shrimp with rice, which was nothing to write home about but had a good sauce. As for me, I got the steak teriyaki. Ugh.  The meat was so chewy that it took me forever to finally get it down. I think my girlfriend had about three shrimps by the time I got through my first piece of meat. The broccoli ended up being the tastiest thing on that plate- even the rice was a little gross. It wasn\'t steamed long enough. \n\nI like the drinks and the crab bisque was amazing, but that\'s about it.

We decided on Kahunaville, because it looked fun, and had immediate seating.  We were asked if we wanted a high or low table.  We asked for a low, which clearly was the wrong answer, as we were responded to with an eye roll and a huff before being seated.  I am a fan of frozen drinks, and the variety sounded yummy, so I ordered one of their signature drinks.  The cocktail arrived, and at first sip, I thought they must have forgotten to mix it, as all I had was a mouthful of coconut flavored syrup.  I stirred frantically and tried again...nope, more syrup.  The waitress came around to take our food order.  I told the waitress of issue with the drink, and she said "ya, I know."  I asked if there was something much less sweet, & she recommended the mojito, which I agreed to.  She then asked for our food order.  when I ordered a "cajun" seasoned pasta dish, I was informed that "most people your age don\'t like that because it\'s too spicy". Yes, clearly 40 is the new 80...love it!  But after assurances that I enjoyed spicy food, our orders went in.  When the waitress came back with my drink, one taste told me that, less sweet, was not something that they did, so I immediately gave up, ordered a diet Coke, & sent back the drink.  \n\nWhen our food arrived I was pleasantly surprised that it was really quite tasty (yes, my ancient palette survived the dreaded spice).  Both my husband and I enjoyed our meals.  As far as the show, asking for a low table in our case meant sitting at the service entrance which actually had a small wall between us and the stage, so the only floor show we got was an argument between a bartender and his wife/girlfriend.  \n\nWith all of the wonderful dinner choices in Vegas, and even right there at TI, this will definitely be the place we skip next time we\'re in town.', 'business_id': 'f6KGn2OyYk6LWEpnUEgerw', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2013-07-11', 'type': 'review'}

My friend arranged a group dinner for 30 people and only 26 people came, but they INSISTED we pay for the 4 entrees because she had agreed to it in an email.  A very long email with lots of small print--the salesperson should have ensured that she saw it.  Even so, the manager was an obnoxious twit. It appeared as though he thought if you attached "ma\'am" to the end of your sentence you could say anything and still be considered polite.  Wrong.  When we informed him that he didn\'t have to worry about the servers; that we would tip them on the full 30 entrees he said "I\'m not worried about the servers, I\'m worried about the company".  Charming. He must be great to work for.  A positive note**the bartender up front by the door made excellent mojitos. However, when we ordered them at the table they came with sprite or club soda or something in them.  The server was a little put out about me asking for a replacement.  Then she said she could only replace mine as the others had already taken too many sips.  Anyway, finally another manager comes by and says that we don\'t have to pay for the other 4 entrees...so it would seem as though the first manager just wanted to prove a point.  THEN; the food was just so-so.  All of the hassle would have been worth it (maybe) if we had gotten a spectacular dish but all the meals were very forgettable.  We were celebrating some friends\' 50th birthday and the manager\'s loathsome behavior really put a damper on the evening.  There are just too many choices of dining spots to ever pick this one.\n\nOh, and I told the manager that I had been in food service for years and was it really worth the price of 4 entrees to have 26 dissatisfied customers; especially with sites like Yelp* out there?

All were not very good, and this place is no exception.\n\nThe service at Kahunaville was not great. We waited a long time to order and a long time for our food. Breakfast is so simple. It's ridiculous that it would take such an inordinate amount of time to get scrambled eggs. \n\nMy parents had already ordered and were eating by the time I arrived at the restaurant, so I had some of their food before I ordered. The scrambled eggs, hash browns, and bacon I tried were no better than what you get at Denny's. It is worth noting that the portions are very large at Kahunaville. My parents shared a meal, and it was plenty of food.\n\nI decided to try the fruit platter. It was definitely an experience. My fruit platter had a whole banana, 1/4 of a pineapple, 5 strawberries, lots of honeydew melon and cantaloupe, grapes, orange slices, more pineapple, and a yogurt dipping sauce. All of the fruit was ripe and tasty. However, there was an unexpected and unpleasant surprise in the dish. They drizzled a liberal amount of some liqueur over the fruit. Why??? The fruit was fine on its own. Who wants to taste alcohol when it's not in an amount appreciable enough to get you buzzed? I feel like they should have at least mentioned that on the menu. \n\nI'm not sure how this place is for other meals, but I'm not inclined to give it another chance.", 'business_id': 'f6KGn2OyYk6LWEpnUEgerw', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2013-12-03', 'type': 'review'}

It was a Saturday night though, and we were interested in going to a bar, relaxing wtih some drinks and having a good time for several hours.\n\nThe waitress told us that to sit and watch the fight it was a $25pp minimum food spend.  I explained that we just ate, and there was no way that we would eat $25 of food each, but could we order drinks and appetizers?  We would definitely spend over $50 total.  She spoke to the manager, who put her foot down and said - no, that we needed to spend $25pp on food, if not, we would just be charged the $25.  (this after we had already started ordering)\n\nThis policy made no sense.  As a restaurant/bar they make more money on the booze than food ($12 drink with $4 worth of alcohol)....Instead of saying $25pp food minimum spend, why not say $25pp minimum spend on anything - or a flat cover charge of $15?  They would come out better overall doing either of those... Other bars that we\'ve seen UFC events at charge a cover charge - and have a big room set aside for people watching the fight. \n\nAs a side note, people who said they were not watching the fight were still seated in areas where they could see it.  I wonder if they were charged the same?\n\nAnyways, so we ordered 2 dinner platters to go (since we would be charged anyways), and then ordered drinks.  The mixed drinks were truly terrible.  Lowest quality alcohol mixed with random sweet syrupy mess.  One of my drinks so was strong that I couldn\'t even drink it.  I had to go get more soda to water it down.  \n\nService was extremely slow.  At one point I choked on a tortilla chip and needed some water (we never received glasses of water) - so I had to walk all the way to the front of the restaurant to ask for some!  (the restaurant is quite deep so this took some time!)\n\nWaitress was completely absent.  It was a very busy night for them, I\'m sure, but management needs to have more people working the tables to make sure people are happy.  We probably would have ordered more drinks if a waitress would\'ve been there to ask if we wanted any!  They advertise having great bartenders who do tricks and whatnot, but I never saw one - and the drinks I ordered were not made by competant bartenders. \n\nOverall they just seemed completely disorganized in regards to handling a UFC event.  \n\n2 stars simply for the fact that we got a table near a tv screen, the food ended up being edible, and because it wasn\'t over $100 per person.  "Meh I\'ve had better" (2 stars) describes my feelings perfectly.', 'business_id': 'f6KGn2OyYk6LWEpnUEgerw', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2014-02-14', 'type': 'review'}

This would have been a good value if the quality of the drinks, food, and service had been average.  Adding an automatic 18% gratuity was insulting and really made this meal a total failure. Our server explained that we had the option of ordering any appetizers or cocktails and paying the difference between the price and the $9.99 Groupon limit, per item. \n\nDrinks - For drinks I ordered a dirty martini and my date ordered a Blue Iguana. The martini was undrinkable and it takes a lot to screw up vodka and olive juice. Literally, it was room temperature vodka and olive juice poured in a plastic martini glass. This martini had never been introduced to ice and tasted terrible. The Blue Iguana was sickenly sweet and without the hint of alcohol. \n\nThis was the first time in my life that I returned drinks. We asked if we could substitute bottled beers for the drinks because we definitely did not want another cocktail from that bar. The bottled beers were cool, but not cold enough for condensation to form on the bottle. No glasses were provided. Essentially, we substituted warm bottled beers for what should have been cocktails.\n\nFood - We upgraded our order to the sampler and a large shrimp cocktail. In fairness, the shrimp cocktail was okay. The sampler included two greasy, mushy spring rolls of some sort; two very greasy coconut shrimp; two or three bites of skewered chicken, three or four chicken wings, some BBQ ribs, a lot of tasteless, multi-colored corn chips; and, a large empty coconut shell. The ribs were average and everything else on this tray was much below average. Nothing on this plate was prepared fresh and my guess is that the temperature of the food was generated in a microwave. \n\nThe decor is plastic and cheesy.

I, like almost everyone else, came here with a Living Social deal. Two drinks, two entrees and two salads: $37. Well, I read the reviews, but thought, "It can\'t be that bad. And it\'s just $37." Welp, it was worth a shot, but I would not return. Even with a coupon. \n\nWe walked in on a Sunday night at 7:30 and it was pretty empty. The menu contains some appealing items. I ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken on top of penne and my boyfriend ordered the Teriyaki Steak. We both ordered a regular frozen margarita (we could only choose between a margarita or a colada). The drinks arrived. They were tall and contained an extra shot glass of tequila. Score! This made me happy. Until I took a sip. I think they would have achieved the same thing if they brought a gallon of sour mix to our table and poured it down my throat. Ew. I don\'t know how anyone could drink those. It was the equivalent of eating a million sour patch kids. Even with the shot of tequila. \n\nOkay, so the drinks are bad. Bummer. How about the food? The salads were generic and nothing special. Now to the food: Once the parmesan crusted chicken was placed in front of me, it looked like a sloppy mess. I\'m not one to get caught up on looks. If it tastes good, I couldn\'t care, but this didn\'t taste very good either. It is basically chicken parm on penne and of the caliber you would find at a Norm\'s or some other kind of diner. I honestly make a better parmesan crusted chicken. Seriously. After a few bites, I had no desire to finish my food. My boyfriend enjoyed his dish, but he also said it was nothing spectacular. Now, I wasn\'t expecting fireworks with a chicken parmesan, but if I had paid regular price for this, I would\'ve. been. PISSED. \n\nOur waitress was very nice and attentive at first, but towards the end of our meal she just disappeared and we were forced to ask another woman for help.

It is very rare for me to write a review but after our experience at Kahunaville I feel others should be warned. My boyfriend & I were excited to give it a try on our vacation after finding a Living Social deal. The menu looked good & sounded like fun. To start our experience we were seated at a dirty table. The hostess apologized for the oversight & washed it off but the rag looked dirty as well. We then waited about 5 minutes before the waiter acknowledged us & said he would be back in 2 minutes. 10 minutes later the hostess saw us still sitting there & came over to see if we had been helped & when we said no proceeded to take our order. I could go on about the service of our waiter but let's move on to the food. I know it is Vegas & food is pricey but the quality was terrible! My boyfriend's chicken tasted frozen & the marinara tasted like a can. My coconut shrimp tasted like the stuff you get in the freezer section (not bad but expected more for the price), vegetables were overcooked & blaw, the rice was rice.  If we hadn't gotten the entire meal for 50% off we would've been upset paying full price for such terrible meals.  \n\nThe only positive from our experience was my mixed drink (the Vacation I believe was the name) which really was very good!  My recommendation, stop in for a mixed drink & appetizer if you really want to check it out but there are so many better choices in the area if you want a tasty meal.", 'business_id': 'f6KGn2OyYk6LWEpnUEgerw', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2014-08-23', 'type': 'review'}

I had been here over 10 years ago and while I liked the food, the loud bar customers and louder music were a complete annoyance.  I never thought I'd return.\n\nI had a reservation for 5 PM which would give me plenty of time for the 7 PM show.  As the hostess was walking with me, she asked if I wanted bar seating for happy hour or did I want dinner seating in the downstairs dining room.  Bingo!  Downstairs to avoid any loudness!  I never knew it existed.\n\nDown about 7 steps is a large room off the pool at TI and this is there main dining room.  I was seated halfway in the dining room and I had a good view toward both one pool area and the stairs.  Right in front of me was a TV with Monday Night football so that took my attention.  \n\nRowan was my server and he was there soon with menu and took my order for iced tea.  After looking things over and asking about the soup of the day, I opted for chicken tortilla soup to start and Bang Bang shrimp for the main course.\n\nThe chicken tortilla soup is listed on the menu as spicy but it wasn't--at least not for me.  The soup was very hot and it was good.  The chicken was a bit meager.  There were some tortilla chips standing in the bowl instead of the normal tortilla strips most places use.  This was good.  At this time came the only glitch in service.  Before I finished my soup, a runner came from the kitchen with my main course.  Damn, I wish restaurants would watch this.  If I hadn't been somewhat close to finishing my soup, I would have sent her back.  But then, it would probably sit under a heat lamp for a few minutes.\n\nThe Bang Bang shrimp was very good and a reason to return.  The dish consists of 8 shrimp with bacon, zucchini, yellow squash, broccoli, red pepper, and carrots.  The shrimp have a nice spicy zest to them making their bang bang name appropriate.  The rice appeared to be regular rice rather than jasmine and the shrimp wasn't served over a bed of rice as the menu states, but it was a good looking dish with an orchid in the rice.  Nice touch.\n\nFor dessert, I got the pineapple upside down cake with vanilla ice cream.  It was OK and something different.\n\nService was very good.  Rowan brought a new iced tea before I finished the first one and he asked if I wanted a cup to take my leftover iced tea with me.  His service was very good and he was a very personable and polite man.\n\nOn the way out, the hostess wished me a good evening and used my name which was a very nice touch.  This is a place to which I'd return if I were coming to TI, not something I do very often.", 'business_id': 'f6KGn2OyYk6LWEpnUEgerw', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2014-09-16', 'type': 'review'}

The wedge salad was the only thing at the table that was edible. Never got drink refills, music was so loud you couldn\'t hear and they take a picture of you, try to sell it to you and when you say no, they lower the price from $20 to $7. And when the answer is still no they still try and get you to buy rather than leaving us alone. The WORST meal and experience I\'ve ever had.

I had a ceasar salad that was quite tasty, but his house salad had too much bitter leaves and hardly any dressing. We both opted for the ribs & chicken because it seemed the safest choice with least dissapointment. The chicken and ribs were cooked very well and were moist and flavorful! There was a good bbq-jerk flavor to them. Our cocktails were decent as well, and while I appreciate the hookup with extra liquor it kind of killed the flavor. Overall experience was good though. We ended with pineapple upside down cake that came with ice cream and it was delicious.

I was underwhelmed by the food and so was everyone else at the table. The tiki theme was alright and the drinks were decent; however there were something lacking at Kahunaville. Speaking of lacking... I was shocked how key ingredients were missing in the menu for their drinks. Case in point shaved coconut in one of their signature drinks. Now i know that most tiki drinks have some sort of coconut but there are plenty for those who can't have coconut. I'm lucky enough that I took a look at my drink before having a sip or I would've partied in Sin City in the ambulance. \n\nI was also surprised how big of a deal they made to split the checks when the restaurant wasn't even packed. Actually I should've taken heed of the attendance in the restaurant before walking in. We were starving and couldn't walk anymore before trying to eat our straws in our drinks.\n\nThis place also shocked me when I ordered a side dish of mac n' cheese and literally received a lump of kraft box, orange dyed, clumped mac n' cheese. The potatoes tasted like they were from the box and most of the main dishes were just bland. A chicken plate where the grilled chicken has no seasoning is crazy.

They asked for a call back number, and I was careful to give only my CEL number - since I live with the "surprisee".   About 45 minutes later, our HOME phone rang.  It was Kahunaville, confirming the reservation.  Apparently, they used the number from caller ID, and not the one I had given them.  (Kind of sneaky) Fortunately, I had grabbed the phone, so the surprised wasn\'t ruined.  (Strike one)\nWe arrived 5-10 minutes early, then had to wait almost 20 min for them to get our table ready.  The waitress arrived, and took drink orders.  Only one person (the guest of honor) ordered an alcoholic beverage - a frozen margarita.  The sodas arrived quickly.  Over the next 20 minutes, the waitress came back 3 or 4 times to say that the margarita would be "right up".  (Strike two)\nThe food arrived in SMALL groups of  3-4 items spread out over nearly TEN MINUTES!!  Several of us had cold food, as we waited for everyone to be served.  Two of the orders were wrong, and had to be sent back. (NOT the kind of service one would expect from a Featured Restaurant in a Major Strip Hotel!  That was STRIKE THREE!)\nThe food was mediocre, at best.  That was partially due to the stuff sitting and getting cold, while we waited for the service to be completed.  (Cold coconut-pineapple gravy atop a barely warm piece of chicken just ISN\'T very tasty!). I ordered the Teryaki Flank Steak, cooked medium.  It was so tough that it was impossible to TEAR some of it apart, let alone try to cut it with the dull dinner knife.   By the time waitress returned to check on us, many of the people had finished eating.   I told the waitress about the condition of my steak.  She asked if I wanted to re-order.   Not wanting to make the whole party wait, and watch me eat by myself, I declined.  That was the last I heard, until I got a quick "I told \'them\' about the steak" after the check arrived.  They hadn\'t taken it off of the bill, nor did they offer any other type of compensation.  (A small dessert, even a scoop of ice cream for the Birthday Guest would have been a nice gesture.  NOTHING). \nThe next day I called and spoke to the Manager.  She listened to my complaints, and her first comment was that I \'should have said something to the manager at our table   when they COULD have done something about it\'.  I told her that no one, except the waitress, had come to our table.  Finally, she said that she would \'look into it\' and get back to me in a few minutes to "make this right"  She took my phone number, but I don\'t know why.  She never called back.

About 3 minutes after we were seated our waitress arrived and asked us if we wanted anything to drink without so much as a hello. She then asked if we were ready to order. We told her we would need a few more minutes. Literally two minutes later she came back to take our order. Once our food arrived, we didn't see her again until we were ready for our check.

We sat at the bar and planned on being there for a few hours.  The happy hour and drink menu were totally different then what we had looked at online.  Gone were all the fun fruity drinks I wanted to try.  We asked the bartender about it and showed him the menu.  He said it was an old menu and said "fucking idiots" I guess at whoever didn\'t update the site.  I asked if he could make the Green Iguana and he begrudging said yes.  I told him it was ok if he couldn\'t and I would happily pay regular pricing.  He said he could make it but you could tell he wasn\'t happy about it.  The whole time he was dropping F bombs and it was really uncomfortable.  I cuss like a sailor but to have someone do it in such an angry way was different.  Our visit just kept going downhill from there.  We were looking at the regular menu for some apps and he took the menu out of my friends hand to give it to a guy asking what beer they had.  Instead of just telling him what beer they had or getting another menu he took it away from her.  It was crazy.  When he brought our drinks he asked if we wanted to run a tab.  I looked at my friend cause I was ready to leave.  She said "I don\'t care"  "It\'s up to you" to me.  The bartender goes "Well I care!"  Like dude give us a sec.
