It came highly recommended by Yelpers and a personal friend who used to live nearby, so we were excited to check it out. Set in the Royal Palms, you walk through a lovely garden to get to the restaurant. It was raining the day we went, so we coudln't sit outside, but I'm sure it's beautiful.\n\nWe started with a couple glasses of wine, and the charcuterie plate. My bf loves cured meats, and we often order a similar appetizer at one of our favorite restaurants close to home. So we were terribly disappointed to be served a plate with only a couple slices of maybe 4 different meats, a small slice of pate, sliced pickles, a bit of mustard. That's it? For $13? The bread was served with some delicious pesto, but quite a bit of it, considering there were only 2 of us.\n\nFor entrees, bf ordered the seared scallops, and I had the short rib. His tasted fine to me, but I only had 1 bite. Halfway through the meal, he thought it smelled like BO, and couldn't finish it. Mine was ok, really nothing to write home about. Maybe we didn't order the right things, but we just were not impressed.\n\nService was great all the way through, thus the 3 stars.

My scale usually goes like this - 3 stars is average (duh), a place I wouldn\'t necessarily put effort into going to but I wouldn\'t be totally disappointed if somehow I wound up there.  2 stars would be somewhere I likely wouldn\'t return and wouldn\'t recommend to others.  For what T Cooks is trying to be, it is not worth a return trip for me.  Not that the food, decor, service, or anything was that terrible, but for the price there are far better fine dining establishments.  There is absolutely no reason to choose T Cooks or allow others to choose it. \n \nOk - so this review is based solely on my experience at the wine bar/lounge area and not the actual restaurant.  I was meeting a group of friends here for a cozy cocktail before we all took off to our various locations of origin for the holidays.  On a Tuesday night at 7, the lounge area was PACKED.  I couldn\'t believe it.  I arrived with my husband and there was only one other person from our party at the bar.  So I scouted the place out and swooped in like a hawk when I saw a party vacate a nice plush couch in the back corner.  \n \nThe decor is very cozy - wood fireplaces going, low lighting, oak tables, plush couches, beautiful patio - very Spanish villa.  But I guess that this place used to be a Spanish-villa influenced private estate, so no surprise there. \n \nSo after being seated, we waited for a server.  And waited.  We noticed only one server in the entire lounge, and people were literally lining up to talk to her, either to get her attention or to simply put in orders.  It turned out she was the only server for the whole lounge!  That\'s not her fault, but that is definitely some poor management right there. \n \nWe ordered some food off the lounge menu and some drinks and proceeded to enjoy ourselves with our friends over the course of the next 3 hours.  I started with the Pinot Grigio and my husband had the 007 martini (or the James Bond martini?  something like that).  Both were good.  For food, we selected the calamari in aioli, the charcuterie plate, and the tenderloin burger.  The calamari was interesting to say the least - the aioli was very watery and almost mayo-y, kind of like cole slaw.  Um, ok?  The tenderloin burger was very plain.  The boursin cheese was creative but it didn\'t do much to help.  The applewood smoked bacon could best be described as stale - it was extremely brittle, almost hurt to bite into.  It wasn\'t even that it was "crispy" because even when bacon is properly prepared crispy it\'s still a little chewy. \n \nThe charcuterie plate never came.\n \nOver the 3 hours, the crowd died down and we were able to enjoy a little more relaxing atmosphere.  But the service never improved.  Rarely did the server return to our table to check on us.  One of our friends ordered a tenderloin burger much later in the night, and it took almost 45 minutes to get to him.  After our first drinks, I ordered the Sauvingon Blanc and my husband the Russian Valley Pinot Noir.  The SB tasted like pickle juice and my husband exclaimed that it was potentially the worst PN he had ever had.    \n \nAt the end of the night we got the check.  $117.  For a mediocre burger, strangely prepared calamari, a cocktail, a beer, and 4 glasses of wine between my husband and I (two of which were terrible).\n \nNot worth it.\n \nWorse, out of curiosity I took a look at the regular restaurant menu.  3 entrees with mushrooms (I hate mushrooms), 1 with duck (to which I\'m allergic), and 2 were seafood (based on the calamari, I wouldn\'t go for the seafood).  \n \nSo there is absolutely nothing here I would eat.

Some of the people in my party were not used to such fine dining, but since they were with a professional I told them not to worry.  Plus the menu really didn't scream out anything to crazy.  We were seated in the center of the dining room under neath this giant metal sculpture.  It took about 10 minutes for our waiter to finally approach us , but after that he was attentive and pleasant for most the meal.  I was really excited to enlighten some of the people I was with about dining like this.  Although I did not believe the food to be up to what some people on here have claimed.  I found the food to be very bland, uninspired, and boring.  I felt bad because I felt I was cheating the people I was with out of a great first fine dining experience.  This place was seriously nothing special.  The service really saved a bad meal.  Now the desserts.  I had heard of the pastry chef before and was excited to see what he had to offer.  We ordered every dessert on his menu besides the cheese tasting.  I don't know about y'all but I am sick of seeing creme brulee on menus!!!  When I saw that he had CB on the menu I was already disappointed.  Creme Brulee is such a cop out!  I will say that the dessert plate ups were nice.

However, I am pleased to break my rule for T. Cook's at the Royal Palms Resort.  \n\nLook no further than T. Cook's for the best place in Phoenix for a romantic dinner with your sweetie.  This place is tops in terms of atmosphere.  The grounds of the Royal Palms Resort are impeccable and the whole place has the vibe of a genteel estate you wish was handed down from generation to generation in your own family.  This place oozes Old World/Spanish Colonial charm in a good way.\n\nArrive a few minutes early and stroll the grounds before your dinner.  Check out the courtyard and the reflecting pool.  It's amazing to think that before this place underwent a multi-million dollar renovation, there was a pink heart-shaped pool on the grounds.  The kitsch is gone and this grand dame has been returned to her 1920s grace.  \n\nGiven the spectacular setting, T. Cook's doesn't have to be as good as it is.  The BF and I have enjoyed several fine meals at this restaurant.  The decor of the restaurant is lovely, of course.  Check out the palm tree that grows up through the roof.  The room features colonial Spanish architecture, a vaulted ceiling and ubiquitous Old World elegance.  The service is also graceful and relaxed.   \n\nAs for the food, the real surprise is the seafood is at T. Cook's.  In fact, the very best seafood I have eaten in Phoenix has been at T. Cook's.  I am always a sucker for lobster bisque and the version at T. Cook's is top notch.  It's lush and silky and every bit as indulgent as lobster bisque should be.  The scallops are also outstanding and perfectly prepared.  I'm not one to order fish as my entree very often, but the BF and I have done that at T. Cook's with wonderful results.  Try the seafood here, it's truly spectacular.\n\nT. Cook's is very proud of its fire-roasted specialties and the fireplace is gorgeous and really adds to the atmosphere.  One time our waiter suggested we try the Mediterranean paella with the optional  lobster tail and claw.  This was the one main dish we would not order again.  The paella tasted like it sat around partially cooked and then they just warmed it over the fire when we ordered it.  I'd never order this dish again, but I would not let this stand in my way of coming back to T. Cook's, either.\n\nOne time we tried the Cream Cheese Brulee because it's T. Cook's signature dessert.  It's a caramel cheesecake and vanilla creme brulee served with fresh berries and guava sauce.  Unfortunately, it was sickly, sickly sweet.  I'm not a huge fan of creme brulee in general and this one didn't alter my opinion.  However, other desserts were much better.\n\nStop by the Lounge at T. Cook's for an after-dinner aperitif.  The atmosphere is very cozy and this place is hopping many nights.\n\nT. Cook's also has the Delos Room for private dining.  This would be a fabulous place for an intimate dinner with up to 12 friends.

I really enjoy the spanish colonial architecture, gardens, water fountains, patio, and charming walk-ways and courtyard. The ambiance is extremely romantic and puts me in a calming, reflective mood. I can seriously see myself getting married @ the Royal Palms. \n\nI\'ve read some of the reviews and I\'ve always had great service here. I remembered one of my dates had asked for a romantic corner to seat at and not only did they give us a romantic corner, but the hostess came with a basket of fresh rose petals and placed them all over our table. My date must have seriously thought he was going to get laid that night by just that gesture alone, but was mistaken, lol. Anyways, I love the lobster bisque-not too salty and just creamy enough. I\'ve enjoyed the Asian pear salad, too which is flavorful and has great texture. But if you\'re looking for one appetizer to try, definitely get the sauteed shrimp & calamari in an organic yellow tomato sauce Fra Diablo. My mouth just started watering. It\'s not breaded calamari so it\'s healthier and also tastes better (5 stars).\n\nAs for the main course:\n\n-Pan roasted duck breast with spiced confit pave, sage gnocchi & roasted butternut squash is 3 stars. I\'m not much of a duck person, but the roasted butternut squash was to die for and the duck was tender.\n\n-Wood roasted "Pulet Rouge" checkan with a rosemary polenta cake, asparagus and Swiss chard is 4 stars. Any meat prepared wood roasted gives it a twist in flavor, which I appreciate. I usually ask for asparagus steamed so I\'m not sure how the Swiss chard is (gotta watch my figure).\n\n-I\'ve tried their fish (they change their menus from time to time), nibbled on my date\'s plates and everything has been really good.\n\nI want to try one of their pasta dishes next time when I\'m not dieting. The bar area is also super sexy, sleek and mysterious. They usually have a live piano player at night. I seriously could come here weekly for just the calamari and architecture-it\'s like you\'re in another world besides the AZ desert.

No problem. How about a poem reader? Got it. Or a private violinist? Again- they will make it happen. They will even put together a private dinner out in the garden for you. "Ahh. Romance", she says wistfully while thinking about her evening. \n\nBut I digress . . .all this talk of romance has overshadowed why I always choose T Cooks for dinner every time I head to the Scottsdale area. It\'s the food, the bar, the service and of course the ambiance. \n\nEnter this historic Mediterranean villa and you know you are in for a special evening. To the right, the restaurant, to the left, the bar. And not just any bar. Live music is always playing and the bartenders (Jason and Jeremy) are terrific. You can eat at the bar (they have a separate bar menu) but my advice is to wait and eat in the main restaurant. \n\nUsually I ask to sit outdoors- either in the front courtyard around the trickling fountain, or in the back, Tuscan styled gardens. On this night- it was a little cool so we compromised and took a seat by the windows looking out. \n\nWarm, fresh bread is placed on the table with a garlicky pesto sauce. Try not to eat too much as you\'ll want room for their wide variety of appetizers and entrees. \n\nWe went with the charcuterie plate, plenty of meats and cheeses to start. As for our entree\'s the sliced ribeye was the pick of the night. But there are plenty of choices from chops, to fish to lamb. \n\nService was spot on (friendly, accommodating, and attentive) and we even got to meet the "Director of Romance", Robert, who made me wish I had known about this service before. Robert asked if we were staying in the hotel (we weren\'t) for if we were- he said he could work his magic on our room while we ate. It made me want to change hotels, if only for the night! \n\nOur evening ended back where it began at the bar listening to old Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra tunes being crooned out by an amazing duo, while sipping a tawny port and reflecting on the dinner we had just experienced. \n\nThis is not a cheap date.  Dinner for two was around $200 but worth every penny.  Go ahead, splurge.  It\'s worth it.\n\nAhh. Romance. If you were wondering where it went in your life- check out T. Cooks at the Royal Palms Hotel. It\'s there, waiting for you.', 'business_id': 'fVgrpVyp-nPLTac9YIjTug', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2010-02-11', 'type': 'review'}

The first time I met him was over ten years ago when I was just making it in this town.

T\'s food went right to my g-spot and I had an orgasmic reaction right there at the table.  \nI saved T for special occassions.  The next time I went was again for some celebratory occassion with some friends and once again, T\'s food went right to my g-spot and I had another orgasmic reaction.\nThe third time, I\'ve been spoiled so I was secretly rubbing my legs together under their pristine table linen in anticipation and didn\'t care who saw me as I licked every delectable morsel off of my plate and fingers, groaning with pleasure.\nWith gloating praise of T., I got a group of friends together for a private dining experience at the Delano Room (min. $500 spending) for a holiday dinner this past Christmas.  When making the reservation, the lady was a bit snubby which I can accept when I am anticipating another orgasmic experience.  \nWe gather for a evening of fine dining . . . except this time, T. had performance anxiety and failed me.  First the waitress looked like she was overworked and coming into the Delano Room was an inconvinence to her because she has just way too many tables outside that were more important to her.  When my dish came, it had been under the heat lamp for so long that it was completely shriveled that I could not tell what dish I had ordered.  I gave her one look and without a word, she took the dish back and asked me if I would like to order another dish.  Where my g-spot was left high and dry was when we got the bill, the antipasto dish that the waitress had recommended we ordered as a 3-person portion was a whopping $45 per plate.  She had said that "some" additional amount would be added for a larger portion- she neglected to clarify that it would be a whopping 3x\'s the amount.  And we had 2 plates of those . . . $90 for 2 antipasto plates??  \nSo what was supposed to be my most savory experience with T. was completely anticlimatic and totally blemished my memory of him.\nI know T\'s popular so he\'ll have many suitors- just not this one.', 'business_id': 'fVgrpVyp-nPLTac9YIjTug', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2010-04-01', 'type': 'review'}

Hubs got the lobster bisque and I got the nights special which was a cauliflower puree and cheese soup. AMAZING! I love that they bring the bowl out empty (well there is fun little accompaniments in there) and then pour the soup right there, very fancy. \n\nOut came the entrees. Hubs had the prime rib and I had the Dover sole. The fish was cooked perfectly. We ate until we were in a food coma. \n\nBut that's not all, as it turns out a friend of ours waiters there, he wasn't working that night but called and told them it was our anniversary, hence the flowers on our table, as we did not tell them when we made reservations. They brought out a dessert platter on the house! It had about four different desserts on it and all were decadent! \n\nWe really had a great time here and cant wait to go back!", 'business_id': 'fVgrpVyp-nPLTac9YIjTug', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2010-11-24', 'type': 'review'}

Cook\'s atmosphere and the ambience is hard to beat in the Valley of the Sun.  \n\nHowever, the food really didn\'t meet up to the hype, especially since they have little labels on several items saying it\'s a "foodie favorite".  \nI tried ordering the bone marrow & sweetbreads and it was not good.  Just bleh.  Salty and chewy sweetbreads as if they\'ve been caramelized and the marrow...  i don\'t know what was wrong with it.  Maybe it wasn\'t as fresh as it should have been?  The toast was good, ended up using the pesto they gave us with the complimentary bread on it instead.  My date had the crab cakes.  I had a couple bites and it was good, nothing outstanding about it.  \n\nI really wanted to like the food.  My date had the lobster bisque and I had the mushroom soup.  I really wanted to like the food.  Maybe my taste buds were off that night?  Lobster bisque didn\'t have the rich lobster flavor, and I caught myself thinking Campbell\'s Cream of Mushroom soup was better than what I had.  It seemed overly seasoned and it didn\'t have the rich mushroom fragrance that usually occupies any mushroom dish.  The only cool part was how they construct the soup in front of you, bringing a garnished soup dish and then adding the hot soup from a decanter.\n\nWe opted for the sampler platter from the fire pit, which had Mediterranean paella, poulet rouge chicken, pork tenderloin, and roasted lamb.  Maybe it was because they had to make a bit of each to add to the huge platter and serve it to us, but the entire thing was room temperature.  Nothing was hot.  It\'s pretty ironic since we were sitting right next to the palm tree that\'s right next to the fire pit.  Paella seemed like it had been sitting around because the rice was packed together, not to mention the grittiness I experienced several times while chewing it.  They didn\'t take care in removing the gritty sediment after cooking the shellfish.  Lamb was mediocre at best and poulet rouge tasted like Tyson\'s chicken.  The pork tenderloin was the only really good piece of protein on the plate and that was only if I ate it separate from the cold over-seasoned risotto cake it was served with.  \n\nI want to try T. Cook\'s again because I really want to experience good food here.  I keep repeating it, but I really want to enjoy the food here.  The staff and the atmosphere is perfect.

The mood is set with dim lighting, siena and sunburnt vaulted ceilings, cozy fireplaces, and an elegant ambiance.\n\nStart your evening off in the lounge, with its posh leather couches, mahogany bar, antique lamps, and baby grand piano to set the mood.  The menu of specialty cocktails will make any discerning carouser dance with delight.  From the "Sweetheart" with chambord vodka, champagne, and chambord - to the "Rose Petal Infusion" with grey goose, strawberries, st. germaine elderflower, and a rose petal, your lovely lady will be swooning with ardour, or from the strong martinis.  The mixologists here know their libations.  Drinks are poured with the finest spirits and crafted with love, and you pay accordingly for an average of $14.  However, do not let this dampen your spirits as Happy Hour is from 5p-7p, and reverse Happy Hour from 10p-midnight Sunday through Thursday.  Appetizers are half price, featured drinks and wines by the glass for $6.\n\nSo after your palate has been readied for the culinary splendour that is about to meet your lips, try one of the lounge\'s appetizers or wait until you are seated in the restaurant to be impressed.  The lounge has an eclectic menu which features "Fruit De Mar" (tempura fried calamari, shrimp, and scallops), the very popular Belgian snack of "Mussels and Frites" (mussels dish served with a side of french fries), "Adana Kebabs" served with pita and yogurt, and even an American favorite, the short rib sandwhich.  Average price is $12.\n\nWant to impress your date? Order the Chilled shellfish and bubbles entree right at the bar, as the piano man croons in the background.  This delectable entree comes with maine lobster, king crab legs, jumbo shrimp, and oysters on the half shell, and is served with two glasses of house champagne, for a mere $55.  Now if that isn\'t the perfect aphrodisiac...\n\nIf dining solely in the restaurant, you will not be disappointed by the first class service, attention to detail, and the fine food that is so lovingly prepared by its chef.\n\nThe meals are split up into courses, and I strongly suggest you do all three to fully explore the tempting Mediterranean treats that this restaurant has to offer.\n\nStart off with the "Burgundian Escargot" (with mushroom raviolis, roasted beets, watercress salad, and vegetable beurre rouge) or the phenomenal "Crab Cakes\'" (with house-made chorizo, clams, and roasted clam puree).  Not in the mood for seafood, but still enjoy good belly timber?  Then try the duet of roasted bonemarrow and sauteed sweetbreads served with their housemade brioche and a horseradish infused orange marmelade.\n\nNow you are ready to clear your palate for your main course, something light to pique those tastebuds...the "lobster fennel bisque," or the unbelievably ambrosial "Pear Salad" with its gorgeous blending of spiced pecans and blue cheese on organic greens.\n\nIf you are a devotee to food, then you have saved room for the main course.  Choose from Chef Lee\'s Carbonara, (my personal favorite) with garlic cream, pancetta, prosciutto, and egg yolk.  For Spanish fare, there is T. Cook\'s signature Paella, straight from the fireplace, or a sinful slow roasted lamb stuffed with feta.  Many more seafoods and steaks grace this menu, for an average cost of $32.  You will definitely expect to pay accordingly for the quality, flavor, and love that is put into these amazing dishes.\n\nA dining experience fit for the gods, sure to impress your date, and your palate.', 'business_id': 'fVgrpVyp-nPLTac9YIjTug', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2011-02-06', 'type': 'review'}

Hey, I didn\'t really mind because as a matter of fact, we were early.  \n\nHowever, we sat in the lounge/bar and spent close to 40 dollars on four glasses of what was a very poor imitation of sangria.  Having been to Spain and having had the legit, elixir of the gods, that even non-drinkers have been known to fall in love with, I didn\'t expect as much.  But then again, I didn\'t expect Hi-C Fruit Punch.  \n\n20 mins AFTER our reservation time, we were seated... \n\nBut from then on, everything was pretty much smooth sailing.  \n\nWe ordered the sweetbreads & bone marrow, escargot, antipasto plate, and the mussels for appetizer courses.\n\nAntipasto plate was awesome, lots of different things to nibble on and share with others.  \n\nMussels were good and the portions were big, considering this was a "fancy" restaurant where portions tend to be miniature servings.  I can\'t remember if it came with bread or if we used the bread from the antipasto plate or house bread that came, but we were all sloppin\' up the juice from the mussels!\n\nEscargot... Usually served either in a unique dish that holds the individual shells and you pop them out with a miniature fork; or cooked together with other ingredients but still in its shell.  At T. Cook\'s, they do all the work for you, serving the snails out of its shell cooked with the other ingredients... It was good, but I didn\'t like that it took the "special" out of a typical escargot dish.  It\'s like going to eat crabs and all the meat was already picked out for you...  Or sunflower seeds already out of its shell...\n\nThe sweetbreads and marrow dish really sucked the last time I came here but ordered it anyways because there really aren\'t many chances to order this type of "offal" dish in Arizona.  This time, it really was good.  Very well prepared and delish!  However, we were wondering what sweetbreads were called in Spanish.  We got our young Hispanic waiter who spoke Spanish by the way and asked him.  I\'m not fluent, but hearing "pan" and "dulce" were not what I was expecting... I was like "Uhmmm... Excuse me, this isn\'t bread..."  He was "It\'s not like a bread pieces glazed with a sweet sauce?"  I had to pull out my phone and look it up.  Holy moly!  A waiter who doesn\'t even know what he\'s serving?  Is that acceptable T. Cooks???  \nBy the way, sweetbreads are Molleja in Spanish.\n\nWe also had 4 soups or salads, 4 entre\xe9s, and 4 desserts; nothing really outstanding or super memorable from what I remember.\n\nAlong with a 50 dollar-ish bottle of wine, our bill was around 410 without tip.', 'business_id': 'fVgrpVyp-nPLTac9YIjTug', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2011-05-19', 'type': 'review'}

From start to finish every flavor was spot on.  The pesto served with the bread to the Gelato with the Pineapple Upside down cake.  Wine list was arranged by characteristics (oak vs. No oak)  and had bottles starting in the $30ish range.  \n\nThe server took time to answer questions about the unique property and share stories.  Even with a full dining room, we could hear each other.  My glass was always full and I never had to ask for anything.  My husband even mentioned his like of heirloom tomatoes on his crab and the server came back with a small dish for him to enjoy even more.  Another staff member came by and took our picture to send us via email.  Brilliant, yet so easy.  \n\nDid I mention they have Happy Hour from Sunday to Thursday?  They will be seeing us again soon.', 'business_id': 'fVgrpVyp-nPLTac9YIjTug', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2011-06-25', 'type': 'review'}

Highlights included the antipasto platter with lots of things made in-house; the mixed greens salad (complete with a goat cheese tart!); and a pair of decadent desserts (who knew what guava could do for a creme brulee). The paella (a T.

You drive in, the palm-lined circular driveway instantly transports you elsewhere. The valet takes your car, and you pass through passageways of intricate lighting patterns. Warmly welcomed into the dining room, which is surrounded in brick, long drapes, and exposed beams to give a classy but comfortable feel. The chairs have nice comfortable cushions for a long stay. \n\nWaitstaff were all friendly and as fast or laid back as you want them to be. \n\nOne thing that I really note is the bread course.

So things didn't start out on the best of notes.\n\nOnce we were seated, the service was excellent. The table was decorated for our anniversary, and our server was very informative. He also hooked us up with LOTS of extra wine, so that was a plus. But really, those were the highlights of our dinner.\n\nI started with the crab cake, which I did not care for. It was very, very crispy/crunchy, and didn't really have any flavor. DH had the short rib ravioli to start, and it was also bland. The sauce was not to our liking either -- kinda tasted like the dark brown gravy you can make from an envelope. For entrees, I had the paella and DH had the duck. The paella was enormous. Seriously...could have been shared by 4 people. It was fine, I guess. Not horrible, but really not so great either. DH said he enjoyed his duck, but he is more easy-going than I am. I tasted it, and thought it was tough and flavorless. We shared some chocolate dessert, which was good.\n\nI would probably give it 2.5 stars if I could.

Cook\'s against restaurants in general, it probably deserves 5 stars, but if you judge it against what it purports to be, 4 is more accurate.\n\nT. Cook\'s is a resort-style fine dining establishment.  The attentive valet parking, impressive entranceway, decor, and certainly the prices prove that.  It falls into the class of gourmet fine dining in most respects, but I have long had a problem with the food being unimaginative and the flavor profiles being too simple -- take the arugula salad, for example, which had a strong dried cranberry flavor but nothing else.\n\nThat said, T. Cooks has improved over the past few years and certainly has many good points.  The food is very well prepared (the John Dory was excellent), the wait staff is certainly knowledgeable, and the restaurant is attractive and not too noisy.  You won\'t have a bad experience here until the check arrives.  Of course, you expected the check because you saw their menu (maybe even online before you arrived).  But after finishing the meal, the net effect is "this could have been really great if only ..."\n\nTip:  before you go here, you might consider buying the Preferred Restaurants of Phoenix card.  Sunday through Thursday (or early on weekends), this gives you two entrees for the price of one, saving you $30-$40, and the card costs less than twice that.

Its an experience that from the second you pull into the driveway at the Royal Palms Hotel begins to surround you and cut you off from the outside world. The hotel itself is modeled like a Spanish villa, and the restaurant maintains this theme with large round hardwood tables that could probably support the weight of an elephant, a huge fireplace, exposed beam ceiling, wrought iron fixtures and embellishments, and Spanish tile on the floors. Everything seems very calculated down to the smallest detail including silverware and water pitchers that look to be hand hammered.\n\nThe brunch thing is a little odd in how its constructed in that there is a buffet brunch which is more than enough to have as a meal, but there are also menu items which you can order in addition to the buffet. The odd thing is that everything is priced such that if you go for just the buffet, it costs more than if you were to get the buffet in combination with a meal, and in the end by ordering a meal you wind up paying a dollar or two more. Very strange. As such, it always seems worth it to me to get a menu item even if you're not that hungry and just have whatever you dont eat boxed up to take home and eat later.\n\nThe food is really very good. I cant really complain about anything, but I will just say that there are certain shortcuts that are taken that are noticeable. For example, on the buffet they have kinda a gourmet version of home fries with onions and peppers and whatnot in it. I ordered an egg white omelet that was advertised as having potatoes, onions and peppers in it, but didnt really think that what would come was literally egg whites with the buffet dish mixed in. I mean, the dish was delicious, don't get me wrong, but it probably would have been better if the potatoes onions and peppers had been prepared a little differently...a different cut or a different cooking method--something to mix it up a little.\n\nThe price isnt cheap, roughly 22-28 bucks per person for the buffet/menu item combo (21 for buffet only), but this is not the kind of thing you do every day. Its a special occasion kind of deal and I think that generally speaking its well worth it. The waitstaff is very attentive and they tend to be very unintrusive as well. I appreciate that especially when you're trying to have a special lunch out with the family. \n\nOverall, I would say this is a fantastic place to go if you're looking for a romantic dinner or a classy brunch every so often. Its a good solid choice any time, every time...especially if you like home fries!", 'business_id': 'fVgrpVyp-nPLTac9YIjTug', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2011-10-24', 'type': 'review'}

So many things wrong from start to finish. \n\nMy brother asked for his ribeye black and blue (very rare) and it came out medium.  For a $50 steak you gotta get it right. On top of that, four out of our five entrees sat outside getting cold (we were eating outside in January) while waiting several minutes for the fifth to arrive. When it finally did come, it was excruciating to watch the backserver study the ticket at length before placing each dish at the table.  When the food is that much at risk of getting cold, you should have more than one person serving. \n\nAnother thing I cannot forgive is the lobster. From the description and the $44 price, you assume it is a whole lobster. In fact it is a claw and half a tail, the same thing they have as a side dish for $20. The preparation and side dishes were very minimalist, so I\'m not sure what that extra twenty four bucks is for. Like I said I expect a certain markup for good food, but you don\'t have to gouge people quite so egregiously. \n\nI started with the lobster bisque, a "house specialty." Not really remarkable, basically what you expect. For entree I had the scallops with chorizo and basquaise sauce.

I'm not sure who came up with their pricing for the brunch/entrees, but it was a bit strange - same price to order an entree with the buffet as ordering just the buffet.  Huh.  Anyhow, the banana stuffed french toast was pretty good - a little dry, but good.  One of my other friends ordered the apple and brie french toast - it looked drenched in sauce, but she said it was good.  My other friend ordered the salmon - he liked it, but didn't care for the skin left on the salmon.  The buffet was good if you plan to eat a ton of crab legs and shrimp.  The salads are good, but the selection is very small.  The omelet guy makes a really good omelet.  Other than that, the buffet is somewhat unimpressive.  I should have passed on the buffet.  I mostly enjoy buffets for their delicious desserts, and this dessert spread was completely uninspired.  The creme brulee was not cooked all the way and the cannoli was just okay.   The other desserts were just okay, too - nothing to remember.  So... my suggestion is to just order an entree and skip the buffet, unless you are famished and want to stuff yourself - then, go for it!  It was pricey, so be prepared for the bill! I probably won't go back for awhile to eat.  However, I did stop in the reception for the hotel after brunch and asked to see a casita.

The bread is served with a house made pesto sauce.  Pretty good, especially since the bread comes out hot.\n\nFor entrees, we ordered the Carbonara and Paella.  The Paella for $32 was a very good size.  The shellfish in the dish was delicious, tasted super fresh, almost like right out of the ocean.  The pasta dish was a bit stingy in portion (eat lots of bread if that's the only thing you're ordering...mmm...more carbs.), but the sauce was rich and yummy.

As long as you go in knowing you may be spending a little more than usual for the nice dinner, you\'ll be okay. I was staying at The Royal Palms and this was the on-site restaurant. Honestly, it\'s hard, anywhere, to find a hotel with as good a restaurant as this. Dress nicely. Not that they\'ll turn you away, but the meal is so good, you almost feel obligated. The interior is beautifully decorated, but the outdoor seating is worth taking advantage of if the weather cooperates. The comfortable cushioned chairs are almost like thrones. The service. Props to my waiter, one of the best I\'ve had in a long time. As someone with nut and peanut allergies, I can\'t remember the last time I felt this comfortable at a meal. Just watching him at work with other guests too, he wanted to make sure you felt taken care of. Now the food. Panzanella salad with butter toasted brioche, mixed greens, fresh mozzarella, heirloom tomatoes, and basil vinaigrette. Fresh, simple, and rejuvenating. Lovely. Duck a L\'Orange with duck breast, leg, and thigh, candied orange, asparagus, thyme fondant potatoes, and traditional sauce. This is one of the best ducks I\'ve ever had. It is also the most generous portion of duck I\'ve had: breast, leg, and thigh! As I was savoring each bite, the waiter came and simply said, "Life is good?" "Life is excellent," I replied. The side of butter-poached lobster sealed the deal. Eclairs to satisfy the sweet tooth and a cappuccino to buy time to soak it all in. It\'s the kind of meal that is so satisfying that all you want to do is go home and go to bed. There\'s no point in doing anything the rest of the night since there\'s no way to top it.

We figured anything that includes crab and shrimp on their menu had to be a pretty legit buffet, especially when you just dropped $500 to stay the night at Royal Palms Resort. \n\nThere are several options for the buffet. It starts at 10am. The website said that for $33 a person you get the buffet which included the seafood, omelet station, assorted pastas, salads, and desserts. I honestly thought there would be a meat carving station, but Alas! There was not. \n\nIf you get Buffet Option 2, you can have the buffet for $23 PLUS the price of a regular entree item. The waiter explained this to me 3 times. Possibly even 4 times...Almost to the point, where I wanted to say, "OKAY! OKAY! I GET IT!!!" He sensed my frustration and said that there had been misunderstandings before and he just wanted to make it clear. I understand too... my hubby were wearing workout type clothes since we had stayed the night on a whim and should\'ve brought nicer attire for this brunch I guess... Regardless, my hubby did Option 1, the regular buffet, while I did Option 2 that was the buffet PLUS an entree.\n\nThe item that made Option 2 worth it to me was the Red Velvet French Toast. I absolutely adored this dish. Of course, it was sweet as sweet can be. The chocolate and maple syrup that came with this French Toast just made it "all the more decadent." Had I known that I\'d love this dish so much, I would\'ve gotten Breakfast Option #3... Entree only.\n\nThe buffet itself was okay. \nThings I thoroughly enjoyed:\nMini flatbread pizza margheritta type slices drizzled with a Balsamic? vinegarette.\nBuffalo chicken, blue cheese, and celery salad. Very clever take on football appetizer on the day of the Superbowl, the morning we ate there!\nOmelet Station - overall pretty good. But even though the menu bragged Prosciutto as one of the omelet items - it was not available, so I went for ham...\nPanna Cotta dessert - rich and perfect texture\nTiramisu - good stuff\nPistachio dessert - it wasn\'t a cake but it wasn\'t a mousse either. It was hard to explain but perfection in every way!\n\nWe did not like the crab and shrimp station. The crab and shrimp had no flavor whatsoever, not even a seafood one. I might as well have been eating lumpy ice. Maybe that was the flavor? Freezer burn perhaps? I didn\'t even eat the shrimp ceviche either, because it seemed like the same crab and shrimp served plain. Usually I love crab and shrimp. There\'s a crab and seafood buffet in Portland, Oregon called Salty\'s that practically killed me because I swear I\'ve eaten nearly 4-5lbs in crab alone, so trust me! I am not that picky about crab and shrimp. We were just so sad that it was so plain, especially at a 4 1/2-5 star resort.', 'business_id': 'fVgrpVyp-nPLTac9YIjTug', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2013-02-10', 'type': 'review'}

Not much else to offer. \n\nAs a disclaimer, I had fairly high expectations considering the caliber of restaurant. \n\nThe salads were mediocre at best. For the meal, I had the filet which had to be one of the worst filets I've ever had. My coworkers had the bison ribeye, and said it was good, probably would recommend that if you do go to the restaurant. One bright spot - the marscapone mashed potatoes, some of the best mashed potatoes I have ever had.\n\nThe dessert was seriously lacking. I had a layer cake with peanut butter in it, I seriously thought that it came out of a Hostess box (no offense to Twinkies), it was the most bland and uninspiring dessert I have had in a long time. One coworker had a banana dessert that looked great, but no guarantees....\n\nLastly, they just redid their wine list, eliminating many of the upper end wines. Not that I'm a frequenter of the Reserve List, but if you're going for a special occasion or on a business dinner, you'll be out of luck. \n\nIf you are staying at the Royal Palms, it is convenient.

I haven\'t had dinner there in probably 10 years or more so was looking forward to trying their current menu.\n\nThe wine list is awfully good and as you would expect, the prices reflect it, though I was able to get a very good reasonably priced bottle of Cab which would go well with the lamb I and a few others planned to order...which turned into 2 bottles.\n\nHere\'s where the experience started going off the rails.  T Cook\'s has a pretty short entree menu.  They ran out of the lamb, leaving only 8 other entrees to choose from.  There were no specials.  \n\nI asked the waitress for a recommendation and she suggested the pappardelle.  What arrived looked nothing like the menu\'s description.  Where were the morels?  What are these peas doing in here?  And I\'m just an ignorant Phoenician, but this thick doughy slab bears no resemblance to any pappardelle I\'ve ever had...or even pasta.  The person sitting to my left, a cultured gentleman with impeccable manners, ordered it too saying it looked to be a dish that would say a lot about the chef.  He politely dubbed it "interesting".\n\nThe Birthday Boy deemed the cod watery.  Being a fish, watery could be a virtue, but I don\'t think he meant it that way.  The other meals were deemed good, but at these prices I would have expected at least one person at the table to be rolling their eyes in their head and moaning.\n\nDessert was the point where I figured I may as well take out every dollar in my wallet and set them afire.  At least I get some entertainment and warmth from the fire; not disappointment then embarrassment.  The waitress eavesdropped on us to find out just how old our guest of honor was turning that day, a number I deliberately had not shared with the restaurant out of respect for the Birthday Boy who really didn\'t want to hear it.  When it came time to sing Happy Birthday, there was a complimentary dessert placed in front of him with his age piped in large chocolate numbers on the plate for all to see.  Ugh.  Cringe.  What other words can I insert here to convey the utter embarrassment?\n\nI am a dessert eater. Scratch that - I will eat my dessert and most of everyone else\'s at the table.  No kidding.  Not tonight.  These desserts were the kind that are little bits of something I can\'t recognize all over the plate, but none of them satisfy my sweet tooth.  Can\'t remember the last time I didn\'t like my dessert.  Kind of made me want to cry.\n\nWe and the Birthday Boy forced ourselves to have a good time in spite of everything.  Then we forced ourselves to pay the $700 bill, along with the tip they forced onto it.', 'business_id': 'fVgrpVyp-nPLTac9YIjTug', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2013-04-06', 'type': 'review'}

Food wonderful, service OK.... we were just starting to contemplate a sweet finish when the bomb arrived: "Here is your check ladies!"... we have literally just put our silverware down and the check was there already without anybody checking if there is anything else we might consider... I was so surprised that all I can say was..."well, I would still like at least a coffee". Purposefully I gave the waiter my CC right away (to the bill that he so promptly brought)... wondering how are they going to handle the "additional cup of coffee". The  waiter came and started to pour coffee to my mother-in-law, she stopped him, clarifying that she did not order any. My cup was filled... and again very shortly after  - to my surprise  - a new bill arrived (I have to admit I was totally expecting to have the cup of coffee complimentary -  after I have expressed my surprise of an early bill arrival) - well I was surprised even more when there were 2 coffees charge to my bill. I have decided to just go with it - payed my bill and left. \nAlso the new decor though very sleek and elegant, but can be found in any other new modern hotel (Westin style) - not reflecting the historical & cozy feel - that Royal Palms as a AZ landmark so uniquely represented. Multiple shades of brown and beige, no other color (remember the signature orange walls and the map on the wall in the bar with libraries filled with old books  -  making it one of my favorite spots in PHX - gone).  The only nice touch are iron wall dividers filled with candles and the "smoking room" still holds the "old charm". The bar enlarged (good move), but very mundane again - nothing to remind you that you are in one of AZ oldest mansions.... just another dark wood elegant bar you can find in any new elegant hotel.', 'business_id': 'fVgrpVyp-nPLTac9YIjTug', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2013-09-20', 'type': 'review'}

Since then I've struggled with how to approach this review. There have been 3 or 4 drafts written and all scrapped. I think the best way to get after this one is to break it into sections. \n\n\n\nThe Resort:\n\nFor those who don't know, T. Cooks is located inside the Royal Palms right at the base of Camelback Mountain. It's hard to beat this location. There are beautiful views. The resort itself is very nice as well. It has an older Spanish Colonial feel. And the grounds have lush landscaping so it actually feels like you escape the city for a little while. \n\nI have never stayed at the resort or used any of their spa services, thus cannot advise. \n\n\n\nThe Service:\n\nIt's excellent. The people were friendly from the valet, to the hosts and our server. Top notch. \n\n\n\nThe Food:\n\nVery good. I had the Corn Bisque which was the best I have ever had. The Beef Tenderloin which was cooked perfectly and the Maple Custard for dessert. The custard was interesting, not something I would want regularly because of the texture. I had to break through the top of it with the spoon with each bite.  It felt like I was breaking through the membrane of something, and weirded me out.  The flavor was good though once I got past the psychological aspect.\n \n\n\nThe Feel of the Environment:\n\nT.Cooks is not for the meek walleted, and it feels that way... to ME anyway. I got a bit of a hoity-toity vibe from the place. There were people in jackets and dressed up. Some had a haughtiness about them. That's not my kind of scene. \n\nIn the previous drafts of this review I couldn't figure out how to communicate this without sounding like an over-all wearing, tobacco chewing, mountain man. Hopefully I've succeeded in avoiding this in some capacity. Although, I'm truly just a couple showers and beard trims away from being that guy.\n\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nT. Cooks is a really nice restaurant. However, I'm on the cheaper side of the aisle, and wouldn't want to spend as much as I did this night ($170 for two people), on the regular. For me, if anything, this would be a special occasion place.", 'business_id': 'fVgrpVyp-nPLTac9YIjTug', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2013-10-03', 'type': 'review'}

Cooks for the first time. And it was a beautiful setting no doubt about it. The problem was with the food. All three dishes were lacking in taste, bland, and far below the anticipated standard. For the record they were the sea bass,  the mushroom ravioli, and the scallops. I had the sea bass and while there was no problem with the quality of the fish itself, it was entirely lacking flavor, a tasteless fish with greens underneath that added zero to the dish. My wife had the raviolo which tasted, as she put it, like mushroom paste in beef broth. Our companion described the scallops as "okay". Perhaps our expectations were too high. One dish is, while not acceptable, understandable perhaps as part of the dining experience on occasion. However, all three dishes being below par for a restaurant such as this is a huge disappointment. I don\'t  know the cause but I do know the solution.', 'business_id': 'fVgrpVyp-nPLTac9YIjTug', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2014-07-21', 'type': 'review'}

I took my girlfriend there because I had a fabulous experience at this place 12 years back. I remembered the charm of the place, the piano bar, the fire that warmed the place up in the winter, great food and fabulous service. I told my girlfriend what a fabulous experience she was going to have until she became tired of hearing me.\n\nI used a Groupon-type voucher for the Mixup bar for 2 cocktails and 2 appetizers and then it said I could also use it to get $25 credit for T.Cook's dinner. The service was terrible. The bar was right next to where we sat but it took a long time to get a drink. The waitress did not appear friendly at all. I wanted to tell her that even if I was using a voucher I would give her the tip for the actual $$ spent but my girlfriend said in a classy place like Royal Palms you should get top service even if you were a spendthrift. I noticed around that the other tables had empty plates and glasses left in them and not cleaned up. The bar did not seem classy at all. Having read Yelp reviews I ordered the duck and the lobster rolls but apparently they were out of the duck. The lobster rolls were amazingly good. Disappointed with the lackluster service we proceeded to dinner and it went downhill from there. Again, extremely poor service. We would have a drink empty and wait and have no waiter show up. We split a house salad and it was amazingly crispy and good. We then proceeded to order the food and I had the lamb and she had the New York strip steak. Words cannot describe just how wonderful the lamb and the steak were. INCREDIBLE! But the service was so horrible that I asked the waiter to call the manager. The manager took 15 minutes to arrive! He was very nice and assured us that our service would improve but it did not. At the end of the meal the manager tried to make up for lackluster service by getting us 2 desserts but my girlfriend had enough and she wanted to leave. I tried to use the voucher for $25 credit and the waiter said it did not apply! I pointed out to him that the voucher said $25 credit toward T. Cook's meal and again the manager had to intervene to get the $25 off.\n\nAlso, the crowd here was retirees and snowbirds who had not left before summer and the atmosphere was anything other than vibrant. Like I said the food was amazingly good but the service was very poor. I will never visit this place again. There are a lot of great alternatives in the Phoenix area for fine restaurants.", 'business_id': 'fVgrpVyp-nPLTac9YIjTug', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2014-08-03', 'type': 'review'}

We had been wanting to try this place for a long time and were excited to go. This restaurant is valet only (which, if you know me, you know I have a problem with), so we dropped the car with the friendly valet and headed in. The grounds of this hotel/restaurant are beautiful and very well maintained. We were seated at this table with odd high back chairs that make you feel somewhat secluded from the rest of the restaurant. This would be nice except it seemed that it also secluded us from timely service. We were seated and given the regular menu and left for a long time. We had to ask for the restaurant week menu when the waiter (finally) came back. Not sure why they didn't bring out the menu originally... did they think if they didn't provide the restaurant week menu more people would order off the regular menu (when most of the people were probably there for RW). Anyway, our meal took a looooooong time, with many long pauses between ordering and courses. Otherwise, the waiter was pleasant enough. I started the meal with the corn bisque, which was very rich, creamy and tasty. It was easily the best part of the meal. My friend had the greens with the strawberries, and this was tasty as well. The mains were far less impressive. I had the saffron pappardelle and my friend had the chicken. The pappardelle was alright, but tasted sort of plain considering the ingredients. The lamb was not showcased, the mint it had on it was so minimal you couldn't taste it, and overall it tasted like something you could easily make at home. It also came out luke warm and the ricotta they put on it was ice cold. The chicken looked amazing, but also came out luke warm and had an odd flavor... sort of like a cleanser scent... it was odd. The chicken was sliced and lost any juiciness it may have had when cooked. Though neither dish was terrible, neither tasted like it came from a high end, expensive restaurant. I'm not sure why they chose to showcase these items on their RW menu, but I hope this isn't the best they have to offer, because it wasn't very impressive. The dessert presentation was beautiful... this place really excels in presentation.... but again, it didn't have that 'yummy' factor that is so important in a dessert. I had the chocolate torte, which was fun and had some great garnishes (the pretzel ice cream was surprisingly savory and tasty... the popcorn brittle stuff was awesome), but the torte itself wasn't that great. It was a milk chocolate and would have tasted much better if it were a dark chocolate... it didn't have that rich chocolatey flavor that you envision when you order a torte. My friend had the cheesecake, which was good, but again, nothing special. Overall, I probably wouldn't come back here considering the mediocre nature of the food and the price. \n\n\nPS when I was leaving, the valet went to get my car and brought someone else's car out.... that's a pretty big mistake... what's the point of valet if they're going to give your car to other people.... eeek. They did apologize and were nice, but I would be pretty upset if someone drove off in my car.", 'business_id': 'fVgrpVyp-nPLTac9YIjTug', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2014-09-25', 'type': 'review'}

We arrived to the Royal Palms resort and were immediately greeted by the valet - I had assumed it would be a challenge to deal with parking but we pulled right up and were immediately escorted to the hostess stand.  We were the first in our party to arrive so they showed me to the table while my wife waited for everyone else.\n\nWhen I got to the table they'd set up some umbrellas to provide shade; however the sun had moved so the table wasn't completely in the shade - they took the initiative to move the umbrellas.  They even brought another umbrella over to increase the shade.  With this I could tell that they were prepared to provide the best possible experience.\n\nThe rest of our crew finally showed up, the server took our drink order and we were released to hit the buffet.  Here's where things got interesting - you know how when you go to a buffet there are your obligatory items and much of the food is cold or underwhelming?  Well, NONE of that was present.  Sure, there were items one would expect (prime rib, leg of lamb, a mountain of bacon, etc.) but the majority of the offerings were truly unique.  The prime rib was fabulous!  I could write an entire tome on how perfect it was, but alas, I'll move on.  The omelet station was packed full of options and your omelet was cooked to order.  They had some potato-gratin that were a little too good - my wife kept swiping bites off my plate.\n\nAfter I'd taken advantage of their mountain of proteins, I figured I'd be a bit responsible and hit their cold-salad table.  That's where I'd discovered my mistake - there were about 20 different options, and each of them were fantastic.  The chorizo shrimp & mussels were so good I went back, twice, for them.\n\nAnyway, I could keep writing about how awesome the food was, but my main point is that there wasn't a single item in this massive buffet that wasn't top-notch.  I'm pretty sure that my family is going to consider T.Cooks our go-to spot for brunch now on!\n\nThank you to everyone that worked on Mother's Day - you made our experience memorable.

Cook\'s, so I was really, really, really disappointed with the brunch. I know brunch is usually a drop in class for any restaurant, but this was a precipitous drop. I opted for the buffet, nothing off the menu. Shrimp and crab claws that were just ok, stale olive bread, salmon that had been out for a little too long, and unappealing desserts--brownie and two little cakes were all sugar and I couldn\'t even finish them. Truly, the only food I actually enjoyed was the "parfait" (really just banana custard) and the jam, I think it was raspberry. I ate it plain because I did not want to chance another inferior bread item. Also, because of the busyness, service dropped off at brunch as well, so we were left sitting awhile for the check. $26 for this...not pleased.\n\nAverage of the reviews: 4 stars.', 'business_id': 'fVgrpVyp-nPLTac9YIjTug', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2015-07-19', 'type': 'review'}

We were surprised and pleased that the restaurant provided us with a private room.  Our wait staff was pleasant and accommodated our various requests relative to room temperature and music volume.  Several of us chose the harvest buffet.  The shrimp and crab were very good.  The green salad was a bit wilted.  I am sure it would have been refreshed if we waited, but there was enough other food that we did not miss the green salad. The guest of honor selected the crab omelette with homemade hash browns, which she said was delicious.
