First experience, went with my parents. The wait for a table was maybe 10 minutes as I went during prime time for lunch (around 12pm). After I was seated at my table, I ordered the usual things you\'d usually get when you go dim sum. Siu Mai, Steamed chicken feet , and sticky rice wrapped w/ lotus leaves. Very fresh, flavored well, and steaming hot ! When even I say hot, its HOT. \n\nThe chicken feet were flavored well. Not over seasoned, though tendons still a little chewy (could have used a few more minutes in the steamer) but still pretty well done. \n\nThe pork siu mai was topped with some masago (capelin roe). Steaming hot. Flavor was good. The pork was "chewy", not in a bad sense but it has a slight resistance that shows it was made properly. There is a fairly decent size shrimp piece in there as well, that was not over cooked. \n\nThe sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves was nice. Wrapped normally with a few lotus leaves. Did not fall apart as i was taking the leaves off. Flavored well, good amount of ingredients inside the sticky rice. \n\nAfter a few other items were ordered, ranging from a few different buns, shrimp rice noodle, pan fried chives dumpling, and egg tarts. \n\nThere were two types of buns i had ordered. One was called (directly translated) leaking sand bun which was made with i believe a salted egg yolk mixture which when you pull apart the bun, the rich, egg yolk mixture oozes out. perfectly made. that\'s the result you\'d look for when you get this bun. hot from the oven, before the bun itself soaks up this yolk mixture. very delicious. \n\nthe other bun (directly translated) is called the snow mountain bun. Has a white crust on top with i believe a lotus filling. Very good. Nice and hot off the cart. \n\nThe shrimp rice noodle was well-made also. Good thickness to the noodle and a good sized shrimp lined in the middle of the noodle, topped with a soy sauce that was prepared to be slightly sweet. \n\nThe pan fried chives dumping is one of my favorite items to get. Parts of the outer skin layer crispy due to the pan fried technique while the size is still nice and soft. The filling had ample amounts of Chinese chives, shrimp, and pork. Seasoned really well, not overpowering the natural tastes of the chives or meats. \n\nLast but not least, is the egg tarts.. Fresh out of the oven, nice flaky golden crust with a glimmering, shiny egg filling in the middle. The crust was warm and flaky but still unable to taste the butter? they use to create the flaky crust mixed with a bite of the the slightly sweet egg center. One of the many favorite dim sum items or snack items among the chinese communities. \n\nUnfortunately this was my first meal, so I didnt get to order much before I was stuffed. I will not hesitate to come back again for another round of dim sum. \n\nA little suggestion, try going with 4-6 people in your party if you want to try a good amount of the dishes they offer during lunch. Lunch is served between 10 AM and 3 PM. Don\'t hesitate to go early or late ! They will specially prepare the item of your choice even if you don\'t see it available on the cart. \n\nThe prices are very reasonable, especially considering this restaurants sits inside the Rio Casino & Resort. The prices are as followed:\n\nSmall: $2.28\nMedium: $3.18\nLarge: $3.98\nSpecial: $4.98\n\n*edit*\n\nI went again recently. One thing to note was the service was quite lacking. Forgotten orders or took a while to serve us.', 'business_id': 'hVSuSlR4uYNnap2LU-6Tcg', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2012-02-05', 'type': 'review'}

This restaurant located right across from the buffet, so we made the wrong wrong decision to fill our stomach.\n\nService: We waited for some time until someone came up from the restaurant to assign us a table. The dinning area wasn't full at that time, so obviously they were  understaffed. It was also very hard to get waiters' attention *any time*. I asked for something not on the menu to get a vegetable dish and also asked how much it would that be. The waiter told me it would be $10ish. Then he suggested Treasure Island Pea Sprout. I assumed it would have a similar price and didn't ask further. However, we found that this dish costed $10 more expensive. They also forgot our dimsum order, which was also printed on the bill. Given that this restaurant didn't even have a line waiting at the door, this mistake is not acceptable. \n\nFood: Their food was on the salty side, such as seafood eggplant in a claypot, Cantonese style beef. They taste good with rice, though. The green bean dish we got was half raw. Chow fun and Yang-chow fried rice was good. However, they are not even par to average in the line of Chinese food IMO. It could be that I am spoiled by SF  Chinese food. There's no free dessert, but there are fortune cookies when checkout. \n\nPrice: This place is overpriced given the food quality and service. \n\nIf you are craving for Asian food, I would recommend dropping by the Asian food court around Chinatown mall on Spring Mountain Rd.

Within 5 mins of being seated at our table, we had tea & food on the table and we were munching away. Flavor and presentation were good and what you would expect.  We were especially impressed with the BBQ roast duck (skin was really crispy !)  In total our bill for 4 people including tea & tip was around $55.\nWe also went two nights for dinner.  We ordered off the regular and Chinese menus. (You might need to ask for the Chinese menu).  The size of the dishes was good and very tasty.  The selection was also quite impressive and we managed to order dishes which suited all tastes.  Along with our dishes, we received complimentary soup of the day, rice and dessert.  In total our bills were in the $55 range, including tips. \nThe service on all occasions was really good without being too pushy.\nBased on our experiences with this level of food and service, we will definitely be back on our next trip to LV. \nGive them a try - you won\'t be disappointed !', 'business_id': 'hVSuSlR4uYNnap2LU-6Tcg', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2012-03-01', 'type': 'review'}

I SAW THIS WITH MY OWN EYES AND WHEN I CONFRONTED HIM ABOUT IT, HE DENIED IT. I asked to speak to a manager because I was so appalled, but all they did was say "sorry."

The rest where okay and some were not that great. The notable bad dish was the rice noodles with shrimp, which was definitely off. For the noodle dish, usually the shrimp is especially sweet and the noodles are wrapped up but separate. These noodles seemed overcooked because half of the noodles seemed to have fused together.\n\nWe get darn good dim sum at home, so this was a little bit of a let down. I'm also tempted to take away another star for service because even though we were seated promptly and got our food quickly it took FOREVER to get our bill and after getting it for someone to take it. However, I am in a generous mood so I'll say that they get a 2.5 and round up to 3.\n\nKj Dim Sum will definitely satisfy a dim sum craving, but it's not that great.

By the end of our lunch, the meager pickings would not satisfy the avid dim sum goer. \n\nThe food: all the classics are solid. Har gow, shu mai, chicken feet, veggies in bean curd wrappers, pan fried noodles, and veggies sauteed with garlic are all tasty. The desserts are the star here. We were warned to save room for all the sweet treats. In the end, half of them were out and we were disappointed. No sesame balls, no soft bean curd, only eight sad faces.

My partner was almost finished eating his mongolian beef meal by that time.  My vegetable order- which was placed less than 3 minutes after my partner placed his Mongolian beef order- was also delivered 15 minutes after he was served (again she blamed the chef.).

Waitress said she would save one.  Then half an hour later I was given the check with no mango pudding.  Had to track down the waitress who said she was already over her shift time and was supposed to leave at 3PM and she said she was told pudding was sold out. I asked her why she didn't save me one as she had promised and she just made excuse after excuse that everything was the chef''s fault and not hers. She didn't want to pull one until I was finished with my meal.  I wasn't offered any discount for the lousy service.  I was told the manager leaves at 3PM for me to make complaints and it was 3:15 at that time. It is now dinnertime and I have again been told the manager isn't there and to call back tomorrow.  Although my baby bok choy in garlic sauce was delicious, both the spring rolls I had substituted for the lobster rolls and my partner's mongolian beef were awful.  The beef was very chewy.

Thanks to the suggestion of a dear friend, we've decided to give it a go.  The first thing you immediately notice is the vibrancy of the place.  High ceilings, uncrowded tables, red walls, soft lighting and very clean/crisp table cloths.  So often you see dim sum places pay little attention to details.

But you will have plenty to choose from the dim sum carts whizzing by - from congee/rice porridge with century egg, silken tofu, fried shrimp wantons, egg custards, taro cakes, pork buns and dumplings.  Our favorites were the steamed pork buns, hargaw or shrimp dumplings and the sweet spare ribs.  They tasted like they were all freshly made and although they still do not quite compare to the stuff we grew up with, esp from Binondo (Chinatown)... they are the best dim sum I've had so far in Vegas.\n\nIf I had one small quibble, it's that the soy sauce in their Kikkoman jars did not taste like Kikkoman.

Here\'s why: (1) Their system for seating customers. When we got there at 11 am, it wasn\'t too busy. There were three parties ahead of us to be seated. They gave us a number. One of the members in the party after us must speak the language because he was right next to the hostess and kept asking her about when they would be seated. The next thing I know, our number was skipped and they got seated. We thought maybe it\'s because they have a bigger group and it was a bigger that table came available. Then she started seating other people that came after us. My husband told her that she skipped our number and then she seated us. (2) Little variety. We were seated in the middle of the restaurant with a large aisle. The whole time we were there, the same two carts came through. I asked one of the ladies if they had chicken feet. Instead of saying that she can have the person come over, she said "later". Later never came. (3) Service is poor. It was hard to flag down a waiter for refills or for questions. Once they seat you, the waiter does not come back to check on you. When we were done with being disappointed in the food and service and ready to leave, we could not get the attention of a waiter to check us out. My husband gave up and took our check to the register himself to pay it. This is one of the rare time that we did not leave a tip.\n\nOn the way out, the line was out the door.

We were at the Rio to see the MJ Live show and asked the box office person to recommend a good place to eat. He said he had just discovered this restaurant was at the hotel and said they had amazing Dim Sum. It is rather hard to see although it is right across from the entrance to the World Buffet. It seems to get dwarfed by it's surroundings. If there is one issue with this place I would have to say it's in the communications area.\nWe asked how the Dim Sum came since the menu did not say if it was priced per piece, two pieces,etc. The current waiter ( we saw three total in a little under an hour) then told us Dim Sum is only served until 3 PM ( maybe they should change the name of the restaurant !) We decided we would just order something else. The menu is quite extensive. We landed on Mushu Chicken appetizer and Shrimp Pan Fried noodles. Waiter #3 came back and asked if we wanted the Pan Fried Noodles Cantonese style...crispy dry noodles on bottom and sauce on top? I said yes, that's the way I like it.\nThe Mushu came out very quickly. It was love at first bite. I can honestly say it was the best tasting Mushu I have ever had. Flavors were perfectly balanced, sauce was light and both the meat and veggies tasted fresh. A delight!\n Waiter #3 returned to ask if I was sure that's how we wanted the Pan Fried Noodles reminding me it was dry at the bottom and sauce on top...I said I was sure. Then he came back one more time to ask if we needed silverware...we said no, we are fine with chopsticks.\nThe Pan Fried Noodles came out rather readily thereafter. They were wonderful as well. The noodles were tasty,slightly browned on the bottom and crispy throughout until the top sauce softened them. The sauce was again perfectly balanced in flavors and very light. We told the waiter that everything was really good and he nodded politely. They are not big conversationalists here but are quiet and polite. Either way, the food was superb.\n I heard quite a bit of yelling in the kitchen and they seemed to be well staffed with servers and runners and it did look like maybe they were putting forth managerial effort to keep the kitchen from getting backed up. There were a lot of Asian diners and I believe the wait staff is trying to make sure that non-Asians know what they are getting. Some people are upset if it not like American take out Chinese food...and it's not...much more authentic...and it is really good...and I will definitely return.", 'business_id': 'hVSuSlR4uYNnap2LU-6Tcg', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2013-07-19', 'type': 'review'}

Easily the best I\'ve had at dim sum! Skin was crispy, meat was tender and flavorful. Awesome!  You can find better if you look REALLY hard in Chinatown, but for dim sum, there has been no close second!\n\nThe Fried Shrimp Balls. These were easily the BEST I\'ve had! I really don\'t know how they get ALL that flavor inside, but they are awesome!  Seriously, I have NEVER ordered items to take to-go...usually dim sum is oily and gross reheated....THIS was my first time, and surprisingly, they were actually good the second time around too LOL!\n\nSalt and Pepper Squid. Another winner! This was soo good...so much flavor here, and much better than the shimp version!  If you like this kind of dish, do yourself a favor and order it :P\n\nShu Mai. This was very tasty and better than the others I\'ve had before. Lots of flavor in the shrimp!  \n\nCha Siu Bao. These were tasty, but very small compared to all the others I\'ve had before. Still one of my favorites! \n\nEgg Custard Buns...So good!  Again, very small portions, but they pack tons of flavor inside! This version was a little more "runny" inside than most. \n\nAnd remember to finish off with the Sweet Tofu! It is a tasty rendition here :)\n\nGot a new favorite in town!\n\nPics :', 'business_id': 'hVSuSlR4uYNnap2LU-6Tcg', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2013-11-12', 'type': 'review'}

I REPEAT...DO NOT!  \n\nMy family and I frequent this place regularly for dim sum.  But yesterday was the last and dual final time I will be coming here.  \n\n1st - they now charge $1 per person for tea, which normally I wouldn\'t mind, I understand tea gets expensive and can add up.  But the jasmine tea tasted like hot water with a hint of color to it, no Jasmine taste what so ever. \n\nService is slow and servers all looked unhappy. I\'m Chinese, and trust me I\'m used to Asian restaurants with bad or no service, it just comes with dining at an Asian restaurant. Especially Chinese.  But this has got to be the worst I\'ve had in a long time. \n\nSat down, was asked what kind of tea would you like. Not aware $1 per person. I ordered the stream rice rolls with cilantro n green onion with the server.  15 minutes went by, not a single food cart. Entire restaurant 4 carts, steam cart, congee cart, miscellaneous food,  and Chinese broccoli cart.  The ladies were pushing them like the wheels were broken or something!  Finally the stream cart came by. We ordered 8 dishes my Mom, boyfriend, n myself) figured we load up since it took so long.  The same cart with the same food came by 3 times after that, no new items.  I asked for steamed tripe, and shrimp rice rolls and she looked around at the other carts and said "I don\'t have it."  \n\nI finally get my order of cilantro and green onion rice roll, only to see a plan ol\' plate of steam rolls, no herb. I told the lady I wanted cilantro n green onion. She walked up to the waitress that I placed my order with and told her next time not to write the word white in the order, white means plan. The waitress then comes over to the table and says, "the lady just started working a few days ago so she made the mistake. We have to make your another one."  In the meantime, no other carts came by but the 4 carts that had nothing that sparked my interest. Asked for egg custard tarts, nothing. Not a single one to be found. As time pasted, I got more and more frustrated as I watched the lady bring out cilantro green onion rice rolls to all the other tables that were seated AFTER us!  The table next to us had 5 orders of egg tarts delivered to their table.  So I decided to place one order and ask for the check...we were fed up at this point. \n\nThe waitress took the check to tally up and added the order of egg custard to the bill.  She came back and said 15 minutes wait for the egg tarts.  So damn frustrated I said NO!  I can\'t wait anymore, I have to leave now (by now it\'s 90 minutes).  She walked away, went up to the cashier, came back n said ok 6 minutes ok because she already added the tarts on your bill.  I finally said fine and agreed.  15 minutes later...no tart in sight and the waitress kept dodging our table because she knew I was trying to get her attention.  Finally got her attention and she went to get them. I felt played for a fool.  \n\n$50 later and we were all still some what hungry. Because of this almost 2 hour lunch, I was almost late to work.  \n\nNEVER EVER EVER AGAIN!!!!!!!', 'business_id': 'hVSuSlR4uYNnap2LU-6Tcg', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2013-11-18', 'type': 'review'}

Being Asian and knowing what dim sum is supposed to taste like... sigh.  There were a lot of Asians in here (Asians, not Asian-Americans... yes, I mean fobs :P)... but that's probably because they were craving food from the motherland.\n\nThe shu mai... bland, small, and the texture was just kind of weird.   Rather than small chunks of shrimp/pork... it was like they just threw pork and shrimp in and processed it together...\n\nThe chicken feet was not bad.  But it wasn't as soft as I like.  Maybe that's a preferential thing.  It felt like it wasn't that fresh.  Maybe that was the problem with the texture.\n\nSpare ribs with black beans.  Again, flavorless.  It was the typical meat:fat ratio you get at most cheap dim sum restaurants (read: cheap, high fat, low in meat).  But again, the meat itself was very bland.\n\nMy buddies had the rice noodle wrapped in shrimp, i opted to just try the rice noodle wrapped in bbq pork.  The rice noodles weren't bad, but the meat... lets just say I think the meat:fat ratio was again off (read: STOP FEEDING ME SO MUCH FAT!!!)  This was also very flavorless.\n\nWe got the bbq pork buns.  My buddies did not seem to enjoy that either... and they eat anything.\n\nTo sum it up:  I think this restaurant was catered towards non-Asians.  Food lacked bold Asian flavors typically savored and it was a huge disappointment.  I think the dim sum that they offer in the Rio World Buffet would've more satisfied my craving.

And the service was practically non-existent. The food came out quick, which is good, but keep in mind no one else was ordering. But then it got dropped off, no asking if everything\'s cool, and the guy then heads back to a table where the servers seem to be eating their dinner. \n\nIt\'s cool, I know everyone has to eat, but I don\'t think I\'m being overly snobby to say that if our waiter is taking his dinner break, give us another waiter. After a 5 minute attempt to politely get his attention, I finally got up to retrieve a bottle of soy sauce myself. Not the end of the world, but not the type of service one would expect for a $60 dinner for two. \n\nGetting the check was a near similar hassle, but thankfully I was able to divert his attention away from the big TV long enough to drop that off. \n\nOh, and you know how when you get fortune cookies, not here, they\'re to "authentic" for such Tom Foolery, but at other low quality places? You know that thin strip of paper inside the cooke that was your fortune on it? That\'s about the amount of lobster in their "lobster" egg rolls. \n\nThe place blows. If you\'re in Vegas looking for a decent Chinese place, as a local I\'d recommend Red 8 in the Wynn. It\'s not really any more expensive, it\'s much nicer, the servers are top notch, bordering on hovering, and the food is genuinely authentic, and fantastic. Tell them I sent you, and get a free blank stare of non-recognition. But seriously, that\'s the place for Chinese here in town.', 'business_id': 'hVSuSlR4uYNnap2LU-6Tcg', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2014-02-05', 'type': 'review'}

I'll be the first to admit that the meatballs have been mixed with too much cornstarch. The cheung fun has way too much rice noodle compared to the meat filling. All the meat items kind of taste the same. Oh and the XLB come in little foil cups which = not good in my books - and the fact that they serve XLB in the first place but that's another story. The pinepple bun/runny egg yolk buns often leak too and they look exactly (suspiciously) the same as the ones that you get @ East Ocean. Hmmmm....\n\nI'll be the first to admit though, their sweet tofu is a guilty pleasure and I usually get an order of this because I'm a sucker for fresh sweet tofu.\n\nShove all that aside and consider where that we are in the dim sum desert here in Las Vegas.

I personally love leek and taro, so I really enjoy their leek items here. I have the following list that I order every time I go.\n\n1.Teochew Dumplings (\u6f6e\u5dde\u7c89\u7cbf)-- I enjoy their Teochew dumplings every time I go. This is a dumplings with clear noodle wrap and filled with leek, water chestnut and pork.  \n2.Pan fried Leek Dumplings(\u97ed\u83dc\u9905)--love their pan fried leek dumplings as well. It's perfectly made with enough leek and meat to make it juicy not dry.\n3. Shrimp in rice noodle wrap (\u8766\u8178\u7c89)-- this dish tastes the same at most dim sum places you go but their shrimp is a decent size. This item is on a must list whenever I go to dim sum as well.\n4. Fried Taro pastries -- the crunchiness of the outside and the moist/ soft taro inside, yummy!!!! This dish is not a dessert, the taro inside is seasoned with salt and other stuff. \n5.Shumei -- their shumei is decent. I would say it's better than most places in Vegas but somehow I still love shumei from Jasmine inside of Bellagio the best. \n6.Shrimp dumplings/ Haogow-- it's also a must ordered dish when I go to dim sum. It's not too bad here also. \n7. Sticky rice wrapped in leaf -- I love sticky rice and this dish here is decent as well. Definitely give it a try.\n8.Pineapple Buns -- I order this item from time to time. They have green tea flavor now which is different and interesting.\n9. Tofu Dessert soup -- I love tofu and they are very generous with the portion. Silky tofu in ginger and sugar soup. Yummy.\n10. Last not least. The famous Egg Tarts -- I love love love their egg tarts here. Majority of time when I ordered, it's hot and fresh like they just came out of oven. I have not tried egg tarts from golden gate bakery but this is one of the best that I tried before. Although I do wish they have Portuguese egg tarts here! \n\nServices-- they are usually busy so they are not as attentive as I would like them to be but they are usually very friendly even though you don't speak Cantonese. Unlike some other places in town, if you don't speak Cantonese In a Cantonese restaurants, you get some kind of attitude :/. \n\nEnvironment -- the place is big and clean. Also its got many TVs in here. \n\nAll in all, I love this place. When I visited Koi Palace in SF (the famous dim sum place), I was not happy with an hour wait, the attitude was bad and the food was just okay.

It\'s not complimentary, I think it\'s like 3 or 5 dollars, but it\'s unlimited refills, and nothing goes better with dim sum than hot tea.\n\nSo there are carts rolling around the place that are loaded with goodies that you can just pick and choose which dishes you want. Definitely if you are going here, I would recommend ordering the har gow (shrimp dumplings), shumai, pork bao, and coeng fan (rice noodle rolls). And, save some room for dessert, their egg custard tarts are fantastic, as well as their green tea and taro buns. But, always be open to trying new things, that\'s the key to dim sum.\n\nNot everything I thought was stellar. First, the XLB or "soup dumplings" are not very appetizing. There is hardly any broth inside, and it\'s basically all wrapper. And, the char siu baau is pretty average, with it tasting more of sauce, rather than pork.

The restaurant is located inside of a off-strip hotel (RIO) so it\'s reasonable to expect that a lot of patrons who dine here are guests of the hotel and a mix of locals. I am the latter and neither myself or my dining guest were of Chinese nationality.\n\nWe were sat in the middle of the restaurant during a moderately busy Sunday early afternoon and were quickly approached by the food carts (we had no qualms with the delivery of food, with the exception that some dishes were served cold when they should have been hot). \n\nA waiter then approached us once and asked for a drink order. Other than that, there were no efforts made to check on the table. We tried several times to flag down a waiter to get some basics (chili sauce, soy sauce, napkins, etc.) and were met with quick turns of the head as if they "didn\'t see us." After several minutes of being what we felt were purposely ignored, we noticed these same waiters were very attentive and visited several times the tables seated with all Chinese or mostly Chinese guests. Finally I was able to get the attention of a gentleman I assumed to be the restaurant manager who asked if we needed something. After requesting my simple condiments I received an eye roll from the gentleman and then an "ok." After observing him going back and fourth to other tables after waiting 10 minutes for the delivery of two simple items, we noticed he went back to the main reception desk and stood there, not making an attempt to deliver the items to us. We then had to literally almost grab a hold of another waiter before they acknowledge our presence and again requested our simple condiments, that were then promptly delivered. The (assumed) manager then walked to a table of women sitting next to ours and proceeded to have a full on conversation, even going so far as to sit down at their table and socialize. I did notice on two occasions that he did glance our way and give a rude, irritated look our way as they proceeded to talk. At this point both my partner and myself were fed up with the incredibly rude, purposeful lack of service at our table and asked for the check, which they were quick to get us and wisk away as soon as we put out cash in. When the server looked in the pocket and noticed that I had given 3 $20 bills on a $58.35 check, she asked if we were ready to pay and I nodded yes, she then stood there for a few seconds with a look that almost said, are you kidding with this? no tip? which was purposeful on our account. \n\nThis may sound like a rant, and it is, but I want to make it perfectly clear that we were treated with indifference and rudely the entire experience, for what seemed no other reason than that we were not Chinese. \n\nFor a restaurant located inside of a hotel to provide this sort of service to it\'s guests and guests of the hotel is unheard of. This experience reflects poorly not only on the restaurant but the hotel itself. \n\nSo my suggestion, if you are not Chinese, then don\'t dine here because they obviously and clearly do not want your business. Next time, I\'ll go to a establishment on Spring Mountain.', 'business_id': 'hVSuSlR4uYNnap2LU-6Tcg', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2015-02-02', 'type': 'review'}

As we all know, gambling drains the hell out of everyone and definite stimulates our appetite.  I am a frequent stayer at the Rio and fortunately for myself, dining at KJ has to be one of the most nostalgic experiences I've had.\n\nLet's get one thing straight:  This is not an average Chinese restaurant.  The place is pretty decent in terms of size and has the patience to deal with people that don't really have that patience.  I seriously admire the service staff for putting up with people don't have patience.  They are quick, friendly, and extremely hospitable and that goes without saying that this is the most important aspect of a restaurant.\n\nFood is awesome.  How awesome you say?  Well besides the traditional types of dimsum, you also have to count this restaurant for dinner.  I've had some pretty interesting experiences as well as some nostalgic ones.  You have classic stir fried dishes like Kung pao, as well as individual dishes like crispy chow mein with gravy.  Though that is more of the American side of Chinese cooking, there are some delight-able treats that they have here for an authentic Chinese palate.  I hate to say if anything is truly better than anything else, but they have the best steamed chinese fish that I've ever had and let me remind you that I am a VERY picky eater.  Be warned though, the price is expensive (40 USD for a pound).\n\nAlthough I won't eat Chinese food everyday but I can appreciate it as it has always been something I've grown into.  If you're around, you just have to stop by and try it for yourself.

We just went this past weekend and ordered our favorites. Sticky rice, turnip cake, pineapple bun with custard and with coconut, bbq pork buns, the two staples of dim sum (sew mai and hai gow) and tripe, etc. The dim sum is always delish and even though we spent a good $35 dollars it was well worth it.

We turn around and lo and behold there was KJ Dim Sum & Seafood restaurant with several tables available.  We were seated quickly and the servers gave us plenty of attention.

The restaurant is decorated in bright and cheery reds - red carpet with what appears to be butterflies fluttering about the floor.  The carpet contrasts with the shiny black chairs and the white walls which are covered with large black frames filled with brightly colored pictures and 4 flatscreen televisions.  It's not quite enough to convince you that you're in a sports bar, but they get the job done.\n\nThere were four occupied tables near us. At three of the tables the occupants were  speaking Chinese and eating Chinese style (eating rice out of the bowl, and other items off their plates).  I always have more faith in the quality of the food at an ethnic restaurant when at least some of the other customers belong to the ethnic group.  DJ Dim Sum definitely makes the grade in this respect.\n\nFirst they brought the potstickers, hot and tasty - perfectly done, then the egg flower soup.

It was just under 2 hours.

We weren\'t interested.  The 2nd and 3rd carts had the same type of items.  27 minutes after sitting down we finally had some dumplings.  They were served steaming hot and smelled delicious.  Unfortunately, without chili sauce or chopsticks, we were still waiting several minutes.  They were quite yummy even several minutes later when we were able to eat them at last.\n\nTwo carts had some stuff we wanted and finally made their way by us, but there was, apparently, no way to make that known without breaking health code laws or assaulting an elderly woman.  But, in choosing not to snatch items off the cart with my grubby little paws as it whizzed past, or tackling the lady and taking what I wanted by force, we decided, by default, to go relatively hungry.  The time honored practices of pointing, smiling, gesturing, and nodding, that have proven so effective in the past, were useless here today.\n\nAs things started to fill up, more carts came, and there was enough in the way of food that they just went up and down the aisles, as opposed to skipping the non-Chinese speakers who didn\'t (couldn\'t) call them over from the other side of the room.\n\nAt this point we were about an hour and a half into our meal, and the frustration of not being served in a timely manner, and wishing someone was around to even ask to refill our water was subsiding, as we were finally eating, and it was quite good.  This next point is an equal praise of the food as it is a knock on their service: the food was fantastic, even though what we ate had been on the cart and gone for a ride around the entire room several times for at least a half hour before we could get our mitts on it.\n\nAn hour and forty minutes in and we were done.  Quite honestly we could have been down an hour earlier, had they served us in a timely manner.  It took 10 minutes to bring us a check.  I put in my card.  It quickly disappeared.  5 minutes went by.  We got a dirty look from the hostess, as they were now jam packed.  A few minutes later she asked us if we could please leave because we had finished our meal and so many others were waiting.  I indicated it had been 10 minutes since someone took my card.  She gave what felt like an insincere apology, noting only, "It\'s so busy....." to which I responded, "It wasn\'t busy an hour and a half ago when we started waiting nearly a half hour for our very first cart!".\n\nAnother 5 minutes.......my husband went to track down my credit card.  He stood there several minutes while everyone scrambled at the back counter to open up every menu and bill pay folder around them.  4 minutes later he returned very frustrated with my card.\n\nThe frustration that had subsided once we were fed came back with this end of the meal hoopla.  The supervisor couldn\'t or wouldn\'t do anything, including just sincerely be sorry, which is what I wanted more than anything.  While I would have like a concession of some sort, quite honestly just sincerely being sorry for the lousy experience would have gone a lot further.  Unfortunately all we got was attitude from the supervisor, and I sensed, though I could be wrong, that she thought I was just trying to get a free meal or trying to bully her with saying I would go on Yelp with this experience.  \n\nUnfortunately, it was a pretty horrible dining experience, one which doesn\'t match the food, at all.  Victor was wonderful, as always.  As such, we signed the credit card slip, and I made sure to snag a pic with my phone indicating that we were leaving no tip so that if one mysteriously appears there in the future I can more successfully dispute it with MasterCard.  As Victor has always been wonderful, and took care of us today as best he could even though we weren\'t in his section, I went over to him and gave him $5 cash and thanked him.\n\nFood? 5 stars, easily.\n\nService?  1 star, and that\'s quite generous.\n\nIt\'s rare and sad that we say goodbye to one of our favorite places.  Unfortunately with the lack of service today we just can\'t go again.', 'business_id': 'hVSuSlR4uYNnap2LU-6Tcg', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2015-12-21', 'type': 'review'}
