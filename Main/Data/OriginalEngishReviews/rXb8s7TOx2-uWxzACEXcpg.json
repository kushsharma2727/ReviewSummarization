We started with cocktails and needless to say that the white sangria was wonderful!!!   We ordered our separate entrees; one of us ordered a salad and the famous mac and cheese(very good), one of us ordered the special, one of us ordered the lamb shank(so tender it fell off the bone and was well seasoned), and I ordered the jerk chicken with a plantain mash and corn on the cob.  What I expected for the plantain mash was that the plantain would be mashed like potatoes.  It was not the case...which slightly disappointed me.  It was actually mashed potatoes with bits of plantain and bacon.  It was tasty.  We each took a bite of each dish to discover that everything was very good.   We finished what we could and decided to share dessert.  We had the marscapone cheesecake with a ring of white chocolate around it .  It did not disappoint.  I gave this place a three because the service, was rather slow.  Since we were at the bar, we had the bartenders also as wait staff.

I had lunch there with someone who works for the Eat \'N Park Hospitality Group, who told me that they hired a Mixologist to create new drinks for them.

My coworkers had a variety of things that were all great. We all started off with a mixed salad with a Dijon herb vinaigrette that was light and fresh.

The deck is probably the best thing about this place it's only too bad I discovered it at the end of summer.  The food overall is a little above average.  I'd consider it like an Atrias with a little more flair in the menu and definitely nice that it's not a national chain.  This placed is owned by the fine folks at Eat n Park.  I sampled a few drinks in the downstairs bar having had a sip of a very good dry martini and enjoying a full serving of an average kettle one rocks dirty.  The wine selection was relatively week and even though the prices were good for the wine I would have paid more for a better selection.  The sangria was a little too sweet and I'd say from an alcohol standpointonly a minor step up from kool aid.  We tried the pizza which was really good.  It had great buffalo mozzarella, some fresh basil, and a very thin crispy crust.  The upstairs deck had a decent amount of seating with a few cabanas which provided for some privacy.  Unfortunately, they only had a limited bar with a couple of wine and spirits options and NO MARTINIS??  The staff was very pleasant and I didn't wait for a drink all night and the food was delivered promptly, which is saying a lot because there was 10 of us.  The onion rings were pretty good, they were the straw type onion rings, not the big thick kind that I like and were served with a spicy ketchup.  The lobster mac was delicious with plenty big pieces of lobster not tiny indistinguishable chunks.  This was a very heavy dish and came in a big first course portion.  The wings had great seasoning, some type of caribbean style I'd guess.  However, they were very small with little meat on them.  We also tried a scallop appetizer that was cooked perfectly and big and plump, however the seasoning overpowered the delicate flaver of the sea scallops.  Overall this is a perfectly acceptable not quite fine, but reasonabbly priced finer dining establishment conveniently located with a great deck.  I'll be back.

I am not particularly picky and I think that I can fairly discern when a dish is not my cup of tea (i.e., uses ingredients that I do not like, e.g., eggplant) vs. just plain awful recipes.  I once ordered crab cakes here.  the dish came with two crab cakes. They were so awful, that I could not eat more than 1/4 of one cake--even though I was hungry and would have like to have eaten them.  They have a couple of nice things like their super thin potato fries, but it is just not a great place.  Again--I wish it were, there is great copper cladding on the outside that is oxidizing nicely, they serve decent sandwiches for lunch so it will probably survive as a business lunch place but I don\'t think it is up to snuff as a place to look forward to for a meal.  One thing I like about the place is that they have some pots/buckets on top where they grow some of their own produce.  I doubt it is enough for all of their needs, but I like the effort.

The second time around, I got a slightly smaller mound of leaves with the missing cheese and nuts, but the one actual slice of pear has now been reduced to two end pieces -- pear skins the size of quarters. \n\n3. Because the menu had slim vegetarian pickings, my companion asked for the vegetable and pasta sides from their short rib dish. At the end of the meal, we were unpleasantly surprised to find that she has been charged for the full price of the meat dish. The kitchen\'s response "we gave her more pasta to make up the difference."

I had wandered for hours all over Pittsburgh with the intention of casually stumbling upon a place for lunch. I had a little more trouble then I anticipated. It came to the point where I was desperate and about to jump off of one of the many bridges leaving downtown that I had crossed that day. Finally, to save me from the icy freezing february waters of the Allegheny River I stumbled across Six Penn. \n\nThe first thing I noticed: it's warm. At that point it was all I really cared about. I was seated immediately at a table for two and I sat facing the street so I could look out. My waiter was very friendly and came over immediately with water. I asked what he would suggest on the menu, but unfortunately suggested almost all meat plates (I'm not a big meat eater). That's when I saw under appetizers just what I wanted that day: A grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup (9).  I also ordered a side of their homemade potato chips that I had seen someone else with (3). \n\nFood: Deeeelish! The tomato soup was wonderful! Thick and creamy and hot and delicious. The grilled cheese sandwich: cheesy and buttery and an artery clogger, but just what I needed at the time. And the homemade potato chips were to die for. I also ordered desert, I got the brownie sundae (6.50). The desert was decent, but I was expecting a little more for the price, still very good though.\n\nI recommend Six Penn Kitchen and if I ever go back I will try it for dinner as my waiter mentioned there was a separate dinner menu.", 'business_id': 'rXb8s7TOx2-uWxzACEXcpg', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2010-02-13', 'type': 'review'}

They're hoping you're a visiting tourist. You're too tired to walk to the strip. Let's face it, this place has location location location, hence the hefty price tag ($16-$33 per entree) and swanky decor. That being said, they've also got some pretty good grinds for the average Joe in jeans and a leather jacket. \n\nThe upstairs roof bar had $5-$7 appetizers and drink specials, but the food was downsized and focused on the greasy (think tempura fried mini hot dogs) Do we really need to make pigs in a blanket sound fancy schmancy? Can't we just give into guilty pleasure and enjoy? \n\nInstead, sit with the suits and do like we did: \n\nShare a salad - No cost to split the beet and goat cheese salad with balsamic reduction. Watch out for the red peppercorns mixed in with the goat cheese - these could use a finer grind. \n\nHave a daily soup - $5 for a good sized bowl of sweet potato soup. Great spice, drizzled with creme fresh and chives. Almost tasted like it had some peanuts in it. Definitely the highpoint of the evening. \n\nGet more bread - their garlic foccacia is really garlicky!!! Who needs butter? Well maybe just a little bit :) \n\nOrder up some sides - We had the soft pretzels which had a little herb, rock salt and Parmesan to set off the whole seed mustard. Yummy. We also tried the homemade kim chee, but this came surprising mixed with brown rice. This is not Hawaii style kim chee fried rice, but kim chee mixed with rice. Bleh. The kim chee would have been better served alone, it has a nice sour flavor (not authentic) but also packs some heat which I like. Mac n. cheese was OK. Baked on top and saucy on the bottom. Not for mac n' cheese purists. Asparagus with Parmesan was just over cooked, but I blame the waiter who left our food on the line for over 10 minutes. \n\nUnder $20 a head and couldn't finish everything on the table. Overall, our experience was mixed. Some menu items are really inventive like the buffalo chicken mac n' cheese with Gorgonzola and the burger on cornbread bun with cilantro mayo and a grilled chili. But based on what we ordered and other yelpers, I bet they can be hit or miss. Our neighbors had the pizza appetizer (small) and didn't hardly touch their calamari. \n\nBetter advice - go for a drink, order something to nibble, enjoy some swank time in the city and grab a burger on the way home.", 'business_id': 'rXb8s7TOx2-uWxzACEXcpg', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2010-04-21', 'type': 'review'}

Some of these are combined. They don't come for anything else, and won't look at you if it's not one of the eight times mentioned. If you don't have many needs, this would be fine. If you do, it seems you may be SOL. (I feel sorry for the people sitting on the table next to ours.) It would really help if servers could have just a bit of peripheral version when serving other tables (especially when their tables are grouped pretty close to each other - there's a reason for that, you know). It would also help if they didn't just stare at the kitchen when waiting for food and looked out. Perhaps I'm criticizing too much.\n\nThe food sounded a little experimental.. at least, when we were there. The hubby had coffee-grilled steak and eggs ($14). The grounds were rubbed on slightly before grilling.. I thought it tasted alright, although the hubby wasn't too thrilled with it. It's definitely not something I'd look for again, though. I had the non-vegetarian omelette of the day ($12).. which tasted like it was cooked on the same surface as a lot of other dishes prepared that day, without washing it out even a bit. It was smaller, and, just from the looks - I've gotten a better-looking omelette from Denny's. It tasted pretty ok, although I don't usually think of short beans when it comes to breakfast omelettes. \n\nOverall... Would I come back here for breakfast/brunch? Maybe to try their pancakes.

At 1030 am, we were the second table to arrive and immediately the host informed us that he had, "a table saved just for you."  He took us up the stairs, away from the open, charming portion of the restaurant and seated us in the dingy upstairs (old fraying carpet, smelled of water leakage).  The only other couple in the restaurant was seated downstairs.  Strange.  A nice but very odd young man was our waiter.  It was challenging to query him on the various menu items.  And the menu!  The misuse of quotation marks and apostrophes was deeply perplexing.  In order to calm my nerves, I ordered a bloody mary, extra spicy.  We ordered the coffee frites to share, my companion ordered the keystone breakfast and I, the huevos rancheros.  The bloody mary was vodka and bloody mary mix with extra tabasco.  Uninspiring.  The coffee frites were also disappointing - clearly the fryer was not yet hot, so the potatoes were limp and grease soaked (although the ground coffee and six penn spices were nice).  The keystone breakfast was not particularly impressive, but fine except that my companion (who has never seen a potato he doesn\'t like) found the red-skinned potato home fries to be "not that good." My own portion of the potatoes was served cold, so I didn\'t have more than a bite and found them to be mushy and tasteless.  But the real piece de resistance of this meal was the "huevos rancheros."  The over-easy eggs were very very well done, the "ranchero sauce" was store bought salsa and the black beans were so undercooked that I couldn\'t spear one with my fork.  I informed the server of the problem and he was incapable of offering a solution - I suggested that he bring the dish back, with the eggs cooked appropriately and minus the little black stones.  As we were waiting for this issue to be resolved my companion finished his meal and our coffee mugs, water glasses and bloody mary glass sat irrefutably empty.  The manager returned with...the wrong plate (eggs smothered in cheese) quickly understood that all was not well...and after several more minutes appeared with a plate of huevos rancheros, minus the beans (the chef did send along his thanks for informing him of the dish\'s infirmities.  The server also offered that in order to address the problem, they were going to "soak" the beans - is that some My Cousin Vinny, physics defying method for expeditiously solving the problem of undercooked beans??).  They kindly removed the huevos rancheros from the bill.  Total - $27 plus tip.

I've had two different types of salad and I would say that you are better off sticking with other appetizers (or the soup)\n\nUsing local produce to support local farmers, I appreciate Six Penn Kitchen even MORE- what a great place!\n\nI would definitely recommend this place.\n\nThe Almost Arnie is also the best cocktail ever- I usually don't drink (i hate the taste of alcohol, and am a huge lightweight) but this drink is unresistable!!!\n\nI can't wait to go back!", 'business_id': 'rXb8s7TOx2-uWxzACEXcpg', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2011-04-25', 'type': 'review'}

I ordered mine with jalapeno corn tapioca and this was the only thing I found delish.

The overall feeling that we had walking away was that we weren\'t let down, but we also weren\'t going to be itching to go back.\n\nThe service was excellent. In fact, I think our server\'s attitude, personality, and helpfulness was the best part of the experience, by far.\n\nOur group of four ordered quite a few things off of their brunch menu in order to taste as much as we could. The apps we ordered were decent. The beignets were really good. The boston cream "filling" that they put on the bottom of the plate and rested the beignets on was somewhat plain, but when paired with the beignets, became a nice, complementing texture. \n\nThe deviled eggs had ham in them, and while the saltiness reminded me of deviled eggs with olives in the mix or garnish, I thought the ham was too overwhelming. The saltiness was a little too much after the first couple of bites. I think the ham component was an Easter Sunday-only thing, so it might not always be an issue.\n\nI ordered the angel food french toast, and while I LOVE sweet stuff for breakfast, I was left underwhelmed by my meal. It looked great on arrival, but in the end, the flavors just came together as one unfulfilling flavor that left me saying to myself that "it just wasn\'t worth the calories." I liked the airiness of the angel food cake that they used for french toast, but I would\'ve preferred more flavor as opposed to the textural experiment of the light cake, seedy fruits, whipped cream and the warm creamy cheesecake filling they used.\n\nWe also ordered the tempura bacon and home fries on the side. The home fries were excellent. They were cooked perfectly, not greasy, and the small bits of bacon included were a nice flavor addition. The tempura bacon was such an awesome idea, but, in the end, their fluffy tempura batter took over and the bacon flavor was too subtle.\n\nOverall, Six Penn left the same impression that it always had when I went in the past. It\'s a slightly overpriced restaurant with a unique menu consisting of truly interesting ideas that never quite hit the spot. Will I go back?

The restaurant was busy whenever we got there and we were asked if we minded sitting on the rooftop under a shaded area which we did not.  Upon getting to the rooftop we were escorted to a little cabana type shelter which provided ample shade to our group.  It was originally comfortable but with the temperatures climbing into the 90's on this day, it was hot by the end of our meal.  The set up of the cabana was also more conducive to having cocktails than eating a full brunch as it was sans table or anything high enough to comfortably eat off of while sitting down.\n\nOur group decided to start off our brunch by ordering the boston cream beignets.  They came out failrly quickly and were plated nicely with lots of chocolate and cream.  I was not too big a fan of the taste though.  It's not that they were bad but they were not nearly as good as the ones that I have had in New Orleans.  For my entree I decided upon the frittata with lemon aoili and pickle salad while also ordering a side of tempura bacon for our table to share.  The first bite of my frittata was awesome as it had some pickle, artichoke and aioli which gave a nice tartness to it.  I would have to say that the base frittata by itself was not that impressive but the lemon aioli really gave it a boost that I enjoyed.  The bacon came out looking as expecting with a layer of tempura covering it.  Since I am a bacon lover I thought that I would thoroughly enjoy it but this dish was a big whiff for me.  Don't get me wrong, bacon is always greasy, but this took it to a new level of greasiness and sadly the tempura batter did little to improve on the flavor.  I should also note that our waitress was pleasant and gave us excellent customer service.  One of my dining companions was pregnant and ordered the heuvos rancheros without knowing that there would be sunny side up eggs on it.

We got ripped off.\nAnyway,back to the hash skillet. The skillet was taken directly out of a volcano oven. I tried stirring it and blowing on it- but it was so hot I could not eat anything for  15 minutes. And this is mid July. Not exactly a good menu item for the season. There was very little egg or corned beef. It was almost entirely potatoes. \nLastly, our waiter was not very enthusiastic about working there.

The waitress saw my unhappy face and quickly ordered new fries. I saw the cook slap his hat on the counter at that new order, and they took nearly 15 minutes to arrive (the resto was empty by now) and this is why I almost never send something back: too much disruption.\nThe menu hasn't changed much - still serving pork shanks (on a hot summer night???) and since I want this place to succeed I'm hoping someone will take notice.\nOnly the servers seem to care (ours has been there 7 years.).\nWe've tried most of the menu and have experienced similar lack of flavor excitement.\nFull disclosure: we used my Happy Birthday coupon for my $15 burger.\nOne good thing - those hand-made chocolate peppermints are terrific.", 'business_id': 'rXb8s7TOx2-uWxzACEXcpg', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2012-07-24', 'type': 'review'}

You put almost all other restaurants to shame). I was looking for a different spot for drinks and decided I wanted to check out Six Penn, despite my boyfriend's aversion to the place.

Plus, we got to sit under a neat cabana and there was a great breeze, which kept us fairly comfortable. \n\nHere's where it all went downhill: our server comes by we ordered our drinks. I went with a mojito. I effing love mojitos, one of my favorite summer drinks. I enjoyed them quite a bit in Florida, which makes sense. I was excited to have one here. On a rooftop! I haven't enjoyed this scene in months! I'm all pumped to get my drink ... here comes the server ... I'm taking a sip ... Aah, wtf is this??

Rolls themselves were bland and unremarkable. \nSausage Grits - I\'m not a fan of grits, but my wife loves them, so I\'ll defer to her opinion on these... which was summed up as "These are inedible. They don\'t taste like anything." \nTempura fried bacon - Dry and unseasoned. Couldn\'t even taste the bacon. How do you make bacon not taste good? Truly a sad day. I was really looking forward to this one. \nBoston cream beignets - When served at our table, they were already cold.

I wasn\'t sure what to expect, but they treated us with respect and, thankfully, had several tables available.  The server asked at the beginning of our meal if we had theater tickets because they wanted to ensure that we dined with enough time to still get to the theater. \n\nWe started the meal with a bottle of Moscato that was very tasty.  My fiance tried the french onion soup and I had the beet salad.  Both were exceptional.  Entrees were the buffalo mac and cheese and one of the nightly specials.  Again, both were flavorful and had portions that were actually filling.  \n\nEven though the entire meal was appealing, the highlight for me was the "carnival" dessert.  You can\'t go wrong with a treat that features cotton candy, whoopie pies, cracker jacks and other special treats.  It made me smile just looking at it and the grin only continued to grow as I ate the various treats.  The only down side was the crazy sugar rush.\n\nThe second time we tried Six Penn was during Restaurant Week.   Same great service and same great food.  The shrimp bisque was tasty (although I found it to be a little salty).  The fillet that came with the "surf and turf" was so tender it literally melted in my mouth.  MMMMM.  They even made one of my least favorite vegetables, Brussels sprouts, tasty!  The crab cake was delicious, too.  Although some may not like it because it is actually made out of a lot of crab compared to the crab cakes at most other places that are mostly breading.  They once again nailed the dessert.  It was a peanut butter cheesecake that was mind blowing.  Creamy, tasty, sweet.  MMMM.  I almost ordered a piece to go so I could have some the next day.\n\nI enjoy Six Penn, but with the high price tag, it will have to remain someplace that I visit for only an occasional treat.', 'business_id': 'rXb8s7TOx2-uWxzACEXcpg', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2013-01-17', 'type': 'review'}

The crowd that was attracted to this location was an embarrassment for working professionals everywhere. I know that this is not Six Penn\'s fault, but this is a warning to those who wish to stay away from the douchebaggery. Beyond the clientele at the happy hour the prices were crazy! Not so happy of an hour at all. I could maybe understand charging more downstairs because of the ambiance, but we were up stairs on a deck for happy hour. Adjust accordingly! Lastly was the spacing. I know you need to work with what you got so here is a tip...get there early for a half decent seat on the rooftop. Otherwise you\'re screwed. \n\nSo, pricing was not realistic for the time or atmosphere. The environment of people was not enjoyable, but laughable. However there was one saving grace there.

It holds significance to my husband and I as we met at the rooftop bar.  Unfortunately, after today\'s visit it seems to be showing some signs of sloppiness. My husband left hungry!\n\nOne of my biggest complaints is service.  It seems that they only have one person working the hostess stand.  The lobby/waiting area (quite small) crowds quickly, as this one person has to walk everyone to their tables.  This backs up considerably when the hostess has to take someone to sit upstairs.  Our waitress wasn\'t particularly friendly, and rarely checked back with us. Their beverage glasses are on the small side and filled with ice, and refills were seldom.  She took considerable time bring us the check then ringing us out.  You would think they would want to turn the table.\n\nThe food is overall good, but also showing signs of cutting back.  My husband had the six cheese pasta and petite house salad.  The "petite" house salad contained a nice variety of greens. Unfortunately, it was drenched in dressing. There was exactly one cherry tomato (cut in half), approx. 1/2 slice of cucumber and 1 shred of carrot.  Why bother putting anything in the salad, then?  \n\nWhen the six cheese pasta arrived, we were surprised as it has shrunk in size. It used to be a serving in a bowl. Now it is in a small cast-iron serving piece.  We asked the waitress if they had downsized the portions. She said it was exactly the same amount, only served in the cast-iron so it would stay warmer longer.  It is not the same sized amount- my husband and I have both gotten this a number of times.  And the excuse for the cast-iron would maybe be believeable if it was actually cooked in the cast-iron.  It was not!  The cast-iron was not hot to the touch.\n\nI had the grilled cheese sandwich with ham and a cup of tomato soup. First, it used to come with a bowl of soup, now it is a cup for the same price.  I can\'t argue with the taste, as everything tasted fabulous.\n\nWhile it appears that the kitchen is well-run, I saw an entire tray of food sit under the heat lamp for a full ten minutes, apparently waiting for one last item. I would\'ve been pretty irked had that been mine.\n\nWe will probably return for lunch, but I would be hard pressed to shell out the cash for dinner considering the service.', 'business_id': 'rXb8s7TOx2-uWxzACEXcpg', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2013-10-24', 'type': 'review'}

Served with a sweet sauce if desired.  Overall, a great appetizer for sharing.  \n2) Local Cheese and Charcuterie Plate ($15) = An assortment of cheeses and meats.  The selections have been different on my visits, and a card naming the cheese/meats are included when served.  The housemade jam is a nice sweet addition to the salty and savory meats and cheeses.  However, the meats have just been meh.\n3) Scallops ($14) = "Two seared sea scallops over butternut squash puree, fried leeks, house-made cornbread, topped with a sherry reduction."  The scallops are cooked nicely by the folks at Six Penn.  This is my favorite appetizer from the restaurant in terms of flavor, but it\'s also one of the dishes I feel is way overpriced.  $14 for 2 scallops?  Seriously?\n\nEntrees:\n1) Cracklin\' Pork Shank ($22) = with "sauerkraut, bacon mashed potatoes, serrano apple puree."  Huge piece of meat! Skin is certainly crispy and flavorful.  Meat is almost fork tender...almost.  However, flavor of the meat itself was just meh.  Not the best pork shank I\'ve had.  This dish isn\'t bad, but certainly not great.  \n2) Braised Short Ribs ($23) = "Braised beef short ribs tossed with julienned vegetables and a whole grain horseradish cream sauce over spinach ravioli and finished with chopped watercress and shaved Parmesan."  One of the better entrees on the menu. Savory dish, with great flavors from each component. \n3) Lamb Bolognese ($23) =  Pappardelle, roasted tomatoes, feta cheese.  Of the entrees I\'ve tried, I think this is the best Six Penn has to offer.  A rich, savory dish, with generous amounts of lamb meat.  \n\nSides:\nMac N\' Cheese ($6) = utilized penne pasta.  The mac n\' cheese tastes good.  But nothing special.  Pretty much the same as the other mac and cheese served at other Pgh restaurants.\n\nDesserts: \n1) Chocolate Truffle Cake ($7) = Chocolate cake with chocolate chips, ganache & fudge, ganache icing served with vanilla bean milk.  A nice rich chocolate cake.  The milk is a nice complement to the chocolate richness.\n2) Apple Pie ($6.50) = Granny Smith & Fuji apples with housemade ice cream.  The vanilla ice cream was nice.  The flavor of the apples was just ok though.\n3) Cranberry bread pudding = seasonal bread pudding.  Similarly to the apple pie, this dish was meh for me.\n4) Lemon and mimosa sorbet = Sorbet is a great refreshing option to conclude a rich/heavy multi-course meal at Six Penn.  The mimosa sorbet flavor was weird though.  ]\n5) Banana foster cheesecake ($7) = seasonal.  Rich cheesecake with a good banana flavor profile.  \n6) SIX PENN "CIRCUS" ($8) = An assortment of "Cracker Jacks", whoopie pies, cinnamon doughnuts, and cotton candy. A very festive dessert, and a great one to share with the party.\n\nService (9.0/10) = It seems many of the relatively poor reviews already written of Six Penn is due to poor service.  I can only speak from my experiences, and they have been great.  Perhaps it is because of arrangements made ahead of time for our 20+ group dinners, and the folks at Six Penn had time to prepare?  Maybe.  Regardless, the waiters/waitresses were very professional, attentive with drinks, and food was brought out promptly.  \n\nAmbiance (8.0/10) = A three floor restaurant situated across the street from Heinz Hall of performing arts.  Bottom floor with the open kitchen and bar.  Second floor with another bar, and more tables.  And an outdoor rooftop.  Casual, maybe classy, dimly lit areas are features as well.  You can try to find street parking, or park in the garage across the street.  I\'m not sure how much the restaurant compensates customers for the garage parking.  \n\nOverall opinion = I think Six Penn kitchen is great for large groups, based on my experiences.  Service has always been great for me.  The food overall ranges from just ok to good.  Nothing spectacular. Also, like other restaurants in Pittsburgh, I feel the food is slightly overpriced for the quality.  The quantity is fine.  If you\'re looking to hold large group dinners or functions, I\'d recommend Six Penn Kitchen.', 'business_id': 'rXb8s7TOx2-uWxzACEXcpg', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2013-11-24', 'type': 'review'}

Then a night like tonight happens!\nWelcome to the trendy Six Penn Kitchen!\nI walked in without a reservation waiting for the inevitable "do you have a reservation" with the slight eye roll and pretentiousness that comes with that loaded question. Instead I was greeted warmly at the door with a "good evening". I let them know I didn\'t have a reservation but was hoping to grab a table. They very politely let me know that it would be approximately fifteen minutes to reset a table or we could choose to sit at a high top table without the wait. Let the fun begin!\nMy party of three sat at a high top in the bar area and were promptly approached by the bartender asking if we would like a drink. He took our order with ease and I threw him a curve ball. I asked for a drink I had experienced earlier in the week for the first time and man it was good. Unfortunately he hadn\'t heard of it before but instead of say nope, sorry, or HUH he politely let me know he didn\'t know the drink then hit me with a few popular ones he could nail. I asked for my fall back drink I LOVE the Moscow Mule which he said he could do without the copper cup and I was good with that! I\'ll tell you this much no copper cup didn\'t mess up his mules trip to Moscow one bit quite a tasty drink.  \nOn to our table which was situated nicely in a beautifully appointed dinning area near the open view kitchen. I don\'t know who decorated and designed this space but they are brilliant! The lighting was bright enough to be cheery but dimmed enough to make for a potential romantic setting for a date or a nice dinner with your family. The kitchen is a lively, teeming view which gives a taste of trendy awesome but also feels a bit like watching Hell\'s Kitchen live and your getting the food. The volume is superb not loud so you can speak with your table without raising your voice and not quiet so you feel like you\'re eating at a pretentious swank establishment where grabbing the wrong fork may lead to snickers and pointing. So the atmosphere of this cool and upbeat place immediately grabs me and sets me down a path to what would become possibly the best dinning experience I\'ve had living in Downtown Pittsburgh.\nOur server David was prompt, polite, professional and in a true sign of a great server eased us into our dinning experience. He gave us time to peruse the menus was unobtrusive and there when we had a question. \nOn to the good stuff... THE FOOD!!!\nSo I\'m not sure why or how this place ended up with a three star!!! \nWe ordered the Flash Fried Calamari & Shrimp as an appetizer. As our food came to the table our server kindly introduced us to the plate from the main ingredients along with the great sauces provided. MAN it was GOOD!!! The chef and his crew made sure that the calamari and shrimp were the stars of this appetizer which lead to a tender, moist, and lightly breaded mound of scrumptiousness. What a way to kick off a dinner!\nWhat made the meal even better was watching and listening to the Executive Sous-Chef de Cuisine Corey Hughes. He directed the kitchen like a WWII field general maintaining the smooth troop movements and precise battle field execution. He deftly controlled the pass ensuring that only the best was leaving his kitchen to tickle the guests palates. I thank you sir for your deft touch it made this moment in culinary time suspend, twist, and turn on my taste buds like mmmmm yumminess!\nThen the entree\'s reach the table with the elegance of Cinderella descending to the dance floor to meet prince charming. Once landed in front of our eyes the entree\'s stood there gorgeously plated screaming for forks, knives and the gnashing of our terrible teeth!\n\nWe ordered the "signature" Cracklin Pork Shank, Gourmet Burger, and Buffalo Mac N\' Cheese. \n\nHOLY CRUD, OMG, ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!! The burger my wife ordered looked amazing and my wife couldn\'t put it down. According to her this 8oz. burger was juicy with a crown of ham and egg which left her sorry it was gone. My daughter let me steal a bite of her Buffalo Mac N\' Cheese again the food was stuck on awesome. The bite I had was cheesy real cheesy and instead of just tasting cheese there was a plethora of other subtleties then the real surprise twist some heat oh yeah some good heat that made this cheesy, ooey, gooeyness just right! On to the dish I took a chance on and I am so, so, so glad I did. It was listed on the menu in their "Signature" section. Well let me tell you something SIGNATURE INDEED!!!! I thought I needed a knife to attack this huge portion of meat. To my surprise again the meat fell off the bone quite literally fell off the bone. It was moist, perfect, melt in your mouth goodness.', 'business_id': 'rXb8s7TOx2-uWxzACEXcpg', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2014-01-04', 'type': 'review'}

I was in Pittsburgh for business and Six Penn was within walking distance from my hotel.   The YELP reviews were varied, but I thought that I would still give it a try.   I am SO glad that I did.   I dined there on a Tuesday night at approximately 6:30.  The restaurant was fairly full, I was dining alone so the hostess asked if I'd like to sit at the Chef's table.   I was escorted to a row of seats nicely positioned along the open kitchen.  My server Jessica (who was awesome!), approached me immediately.  I started with one of the most amazing Sangria's that  I've had in a very long time, handmade with freshly muddled fruit served over crushed ice.  The drink was well worth the $10 price.   I also order the cold weather wedge salad as a starter.   Portion was small and it was a bit pricey at $10, but overall it was pretty good.   The salad was served, deconstructed with bibb lettuce, bacon lardoons, mustardy dressing, and housemade pickle relish.  For my entree, I ordered the skillet roasted chicken, which consisted of 1/2 chicken roasted and cut-up, on top of brussel sprout succotash topped with a large savory biscuit and bacon bechamel sauce, all served in a piping hot cast iron skillet.   The portion was huge and everything was well prepared.   My only complaint was the brussel sprout succotash.  I assumed that it would contain corn and brussel sprouts.  There were green peas (which I don't like) and roasted tomatoes (which were a nice addition),   There were SO many peas, it was hard to pick around them.   My server, Jessica, stopped by to check on my progress and I mentioned my dislike for peas and asked if I could get a side order of just brussel sprouts (love them!), she obliged and within just a few minutes, I had a delightful side of perfectly roasted sprouts.  I happily added them to my entree and proceeded to eat as much of it, as I could.   Even though I was already stuffed, I did order dessert and once again, I'm glad that I did.   I ordered the individual serving of apple pie and ice cream.   Once again the portion was huge, more than enought for 2-3 people to share.   I couldn't finish it all,  The crust was tender, flaky and delicious.  There was a nice mix of different types of fresh apples and the entire dessert was topped with cinnamon ice cream....yum!!!

The honey butter was good, but much improved by a little sprinkling of salt.  \n\nSoup.   The SOD was a poblano corn chowder, which was delicious.   Perfect temp and consistency, with just a hint of spice.   \n\nEntree.   My experience here was kind of mixed.  I ordered the special...redfish and crab over roasted tomatoes, purple beans, and broth.   The broth was amazing!  Rich and flavorful...I wanted to lick the bowl.   The crab and tomatoes were also awesome.   The redfish was not so great.  It was really tough and dry...I needed to use a knife to cut it.   The purple beans were described as "like green beans, but with a purple vein"...which is really not a great description.   Honestly, the beans are more like edamame.  Tender  beans inside a pretty tough pod.   I didn\'t love them.  \n\nService. So-so.   My cocktails was empty for quite some time and overall, she just seemed a step behind.   Not "bad" by any means, but not exceptional either.', 'business_id': 'rXb8s7TOx2-uWxzACEXcpg', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2014-09-07', 'type': 'review'}

Until a couple months ago when researching gluten-free restaurant options, this once again became a mainstay on our dining list. (And we\'ve already been back a few times -- mostly for the french onion soup!)\n\nThere are SEVERAL options for gluten-free identified on the regular menu, and their kitchen is incredible with making additional substitutions when asked. On one visit I had their pizza (made with cauliflower crust) and a mix of seasonal vegetables (I can\'t have tomato sauce either, so they made a wonderful white pizza for me). On another visit, I had their duck breast entree, served with a lovely lentil puree and roasted vegetables (they even gave me more to make up for having to leave off some kind of crostini). I can\'t believe I\'m admitting this, but I snagged a bite of the boyfriend\'s beet salad and LOVED it (and I am a fervent beet hater). And then the server recommended a "gluten-free" version of their apple pie (basically the pie\'s most delicious part -- the center) with some ice cream. This lady speaks right to my heart!\n\nI am infinitely impressed with the service (several managers also checked in on us to ensure our meal was excellent), their unwavering (and uncomplicated) support of people with diet restrictions, and the food. Six Penn is doing so many things right, and they make "eating like a normal person" too easy (I also suggest grabbing a table near the kitchen to hear the chef and his crew at work!). \n\nYES, CHEF...

It came served on warm doughy biscuits, and topped with a mountain of perfectly cooked scrambled eggs and sausage gravy. It was fantastic! My boyfriend got eggs benedict, which were also great and had delicious collard greens on them. Certainly glad I went there on an empty stomach!

Our party of three had dinner here last weekend based on a recommendation from the Omni hotel.  We tried the fried calamari appetizer and the winter salad.  The calamari was heavily breaded, greasy and too salty.  The salad may have been okay and just not what I expected.  The greens were unpleasant to eat.  I could not find the endive, the kale was tough and there was very little cheese.  For the price of $11 I expected a nicer salad.  Our guest ordered the Lamb Bolognese and said it was delicious.  The other two of us ordered the duck breast.  We were told it was normally served medium rare, which is typical so that was fine.  It was served raw, actually purple.  We sent it back.  It was brought back to us pretty much the same - undercooked - but perhaps tossed in a sauce so you could not see that it was still raw in the center.  It was getting late and I did not want to spoil the evening so I ate it anyway.  My husband sent his back and tried the Bolognese.  Complimentary desserts were brought, which was nice, but our guest had just ordered a beer so no one was really ready to dig into a dessert.  I ordered a decaf espresso which was brought to me cold.  After the problem with the duck, the wait staff was sort of hovering and interrupting our conversation to the point that we just wanted to get out of there.

I can\'t say that I\'ve had a bad meal here but I\'ve just never had a great meal here.  On my most recent visit I brought a friend here for brunch before we went to see Boeing, Boeing at the CLO Cabaret.  I made reservations online through Open Table and was a little worried when I received a voicemail from Six Penn on Thursday asking me to call them back about my reservations (I originally wanted to take my friend to Meat & Potatoes for brunch because neither of us have been there before but they were booked) soooo I called back and spoke to the hostess who said that she was simply calling me to have me call THEM back to confirm my reservation for Sunday brunch.  REALLY?!?  I mean, ok, I guess maybe sometimes people bail on their reservations but that was just odd.  \n\nSo, then comes Sunday and we show up promptly at noon only to have to wait for someone to show up to the front desk to check us in.  Not a big deal, but then the hostess seemed perplexed when I told her that I had made a reservation for 2...anyhow, so way upstairs we go and are seated in a nice side room near the windows.  So far it\'s not so bad but then comes our server...I don\'t remember her name, but she must have been having an awful day because she was NOT friendly...not at all.  In fact she seemed really annoyed that we dared to order coffee *GASP* after NOON!!!  She seem really put out that she had to make coffee, then I asked her ahead of time to please bring out more "Sugar in the Raw" because there were only 2 packets in the container at our table and you would have thought that I was speaking a foreign language because it took me asking her 3 times worded 3 different ways before she got the gist of what I wanted and she again seemed put out.  My friend told me that I stated my request clearly and politely all 3 times, so who knows. We ordered the beignets to start and they were warm and sweet and were probably my favorite part of the meal, even though I prefer savory to sweet things.  I ordered the shrimp and grits and my friend ordered the chicken fried steak.  Both were tasty, but I tried a bit of her chicken fried steak and we both agreed that it tasted dry - thank goodness it had gravy on it to help moisten it a bit.  The shrimp and grits were a little bland but salty - I\'m not sure how that happens, but that\'s how it hit my palate.  It took forever to get a refill on my coffee even though our server refilled the coffee of the table next to us (which arrived after we did and see, they wanted coffee after noon as well) and when she finally did refill my coffee we were ready for our check which again took an inordinately long time to get.  Maybe she was having a bad morning, I really don\'t know but the service on this day makes me less inclined to make a trip back here again especially when there are a lot of other choices downtown and in the nearby Strip District for brunch.', 'business_id': 'rXb8s7TOx2-uWxzACEXcpg', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2015-03-15', 'type': 'review'}

We sat at the bar, which was near empty when we arrived but was completely occupied by the time we left for our show, and had friendly service, in general. The male bartender-I wish I had caught his name- was much friendlier than the female bartender, and coincidentally, each round of drinks we had was made by a different bartender and our second round, made by the male bartender, was much tastier (and stronger!), than the first round. Anywho....I chose to indulge in the Tennessee Treat (Jack Daniels, pear liqueur, Blackberry shrub and rhubarb bitters) and my bf chose the Six Penn Sangria with pinot noir. Both drinks were excellent! So excellent I had to stop at two or I would have indulged in a third :) The charcuterie and cheese plate came with smoked mozzerella, brie, and havrati (I think), along with pork liver mousse, mortadella, and pancetta. There were also olives and crostini on the plate. I will return and sample actual meals but I'm glad I have another place to add to my repertoire of downtown drink/snack destinations before seeing any of the shows in the cultural district!", 'business_id': 'rXb8s7TOx2-uWxzACEXcpg', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2015-03-30', 'type': 'review'}

Making a reservation was wise - this place is busy! The staff is exceedingly friendly and welcoming as well.  Food arrived quickly - greatly appreciated since we had a full day of activities. \n\nWhat we ate:\nI ordered a Bloody Mary - nothing quite compares to a well made bloody mary and I have sampled a whole range. Unfortunately, here, the mix they make up is so heavily spiced that it is undrinkable. I like some heat with my bloody mary but I also like to actually taste more than Tabasco - the complexity of the flavors was completely lost. On a scale of 1-10 for heat this easily landed at an 8. I would not be surprised if the person making the mix had twice seasoned it but wonder why they did not bother to taste it to make sure it was mixed correctly. \n\nTypically the drink should be made medium hot - this burned my throat and destroyed my pallet for the meal. I asked for the bar to remake the drink but was told that it was a premade mix and was offered some plain tomato juice to temper it. Didn't really improve the drink. Super disappointed and I left essentially a full $10 drink on the table. Note to self: never order a Bloody Mary here again. \n\nFor the meal my husband and daughter wisely ordered the waffles. They were crisp and tasted great. The buttermilk gelato was a nice, fresh contrast with a really light flavor. They really nailed that dish. Next time I will be ordering that. \n\nHe also ordered a side of bacon - that was an error. It came out late, really greasy and looked as thought it had been on the flattop too long - really overcooked, broken into several pieces. I would have expected a better quality, thick sliced bacon than the thin, over done version we were served. He actually didn't finish it and for him - that says it all. I have never seen him pass up bacon. \n\nI ordered the shrimp and grits. Yikes, what a mistake. They clearly don't understand how to cook grits... they need to be creamy and smooth. Cooked slowly. Here the grits were very thick and clumpy. The consistency of mashed potatoes. Further, not sure if the person seasoning the shrimp also made the bloody mary mix, but again, too much heat. In defense of the kitchen it was noted as creole seasoning and part of the issue really may have been the terrible drink I was served. the grits, however, were unforgivable. \n\nIn the end it was a mixed bag. The service was outstanding. The manager popped by to check on us. The server, Tim, was efficient and friendly. Everyone made you feel welcomed and even with how busy the place was you never felt rushed or that the staff was in the weeds. \n\nThe drink really ruined the entire meal for me and the grits were terrible. That said, I would likely head back and get the waffles - or maybe the French toast...", 'business_id': 'rXb8s7TOx2-uWxzACEXcpg', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2015-04-20', 'type': 'review'}

Yes, a few of them were probably a little too intoxicated to be served and I never criticize a manager for responsible serving. BUT, some of them were not drunk and the little I saw left me with the impression that the situation could have been handled better on their end. F&B managers should have the skills and finesse to handle those situations so as not to lose business, maintain the safely of their staff and guests and make the experience a winning one for all parties. I wasn't there for the whole exchange, but it sounded like they weren't willing to serve any of the party as long as they were on the (desireable) rooftop, but would serve them on another, less requested, floor. The reservation was for dinner but since the girls decided to order a bunch of appetizers and plates to share, it seemed like the catalyst was to save the table for a higher spending party. Why else would they offer to serve the group on another floor, but not on the roof? \n\nI also got the impression that specific members of the party were called out and embarrassed in front of other guests and the rest of the girls. Like I said, I am all for responsible serving, but there is a manner in which a manager should handle such situations and it appears as though this was handled poorly. There a lot of places that people can choose to spend their money and special occasions downtown and in my opinion and experience, managers should not only prioritize their safe practice, but the experience of the guest. \n\nThat being said, I still plan to return at some point and will write a review based on that experience as well. I hope my second impression is better.", 'business_id': 'rXb8s7TOx2-uWxzACEXcpg', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2015-05-16', 'type': 'review'}

The pictures online showed the tables were shaded. Upon arrival, service was nowhere to be found. We have to continually walk to the bar and wait in a line to get service for the dozen or so folks in our party.\n\nUnfortunately, the shading was sparse and not all tables equipped for an umbrella were actually equipped. Because our party was split between tables, we all consolidated as much as possible to allow for other patrons to sit but did something unspeakable... We collapsed the umbrella and moved it to an adjacent table so that we could properly shade our party.\n\nWe continued to fetch our beverages and our food for a time and then a seemingly random grease-ball struts over to our table and starts spouting off about moving the umbrella over 2 hours earlier. He didn't even know if it was us or not, he just started spouting off.\n\nWe didn't even know who he was until we asked staff what just happened and they advised he was the GM. I thought about how nice of him it was to introduce himself and conduct himself in a professional manner in front of our party.\n\nAnyways, the dozen folks left in our party at that point all lost their thirst and we moved on.

I would recommend this place to anyone headed down to the cultural district, you won't be disappointed!", 'business_id': 'rXb8s7TOx2-uWxzACEXcpg', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2015-10-23', 'type': 'review'}

Received service right away and was seated at the seating overlooking the kitchen. These turn out to be my favorite seats at restaurants. Where you get to watch all the action as it happens. The food was on point as always. Service was fast... In and out because we had tickets to the hockey game. Less than 40 minutes and we were on our way. As always recommend this spot.', 'business_id': 'rXb8s7TOx2-uWxzACEXcpg', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2015-11-22', 'type': 'review'}

Yesterday was our first brunch and we were very satisfied.  My wife requires gluten free and they have GF items.  Unfortunately with the Keystone breakfast (eggs, sausage, bacon, home fries & toast), she had to forego both the home fries and the toast.  Seems like you could make up some gluten free home fries.  But she said the eggs, sausage and bacon were excellent.  The Monte Cristo was also very good.  The tea and coffee were served in pre-heated cups which helps keep the beverage warm longer.  We wouldn't make a special trip downtown to eat there but it has been a dependable place to eat when going to concerts and other downtown functions.  We've always had good service even when it has been busy.  This restaurant is in the heart of the cultural district and can get very busy, so you may was to make Open Table reservations.", 'business_id': 'rXb8s7TOx2-uWxzACEXcpg', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2015-11-30', 'type': 'review'}

Thanks to my workplace I didn't have to worry about prices. All in all it was a good experience. And I'll probably be back for another special occasion. \n\nThe food was very elaborate. I had pork ramen and it was delicious. My girlfriend had the rabbit and now that was exquisite (yes she let me try it). We were having Infinitus white wine from Spain which was pretty amazing. Next time we're going for the bottle. However, we did wait long enough to get the wine refills but it did came eventually. \n\nThe environment was loud in general. I couldn't really hear my coworkers and their significant others on the other side of the table. Even though the decor and ambiance make it seem like they're trying to show a quieter, easy talk, mellow restaurant.", 'business_id': 'rXb8s7TOx2-uWxzACEXcpg', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2015-12-11', 'type': 'review'}
