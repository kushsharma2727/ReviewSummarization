There were a few people in there but it wasn't packed.  I had the Sopes,  (Sopes -Three  handmade tortillas gorditas, lightly deep fried. Topped with chorizo, carne asada or pollo asado.) with carne asada a taco, basically, but with a  thicker, fried corn tortilla, complete with onions, cilantro, etc.  No sissy lettuce and tomato on these tacos.  It also came with beans and rice (some of the better rice I've had, I find it always to be dry and bland, but I like flavor) I finished 2 of them (out of the 3 I had), but couldn't handle eating anymore.  My boyfriend had a dish that was even better than mine.  I can't remember the name of it, but I'm waiting for him to answer me so I know what it is. - Now I know! It was the Steak Picado- (New York steak in small chunks, saut\xe9ed with onions, cilantro, jalape\xf1os, tomatoes and mixed with Spanish & verde sauce.) I remember, it was nice chunks of meat in a red sauce (not mole, not chile colorado), I took a bite of it, and the meat was incredibly tender, not the dry, in the crockpot for 6 hours, shredded tender, the tender that only comes from a good piece of meat.  It yields slightly, but as soon as you bit in, it's pure, soft, moist bliss.  And no gristle!  Their handmade tortillas are also very, very good.  I watched the nice lady make tortillas the whole time I was there, she was a busy lady!  \nWe finished it off with the fried ice cream.  To me, it left more to be desired.  The coating seemed...almost stale, it was hard to chew and the ice cream was just plain vanilla ice cream.  I heard the table next to us order the fried banana after the waiter's suggestion, they seemed satisfied with it and finished the whole thing.

After over 6 years of patronizing Viva Mercados as the only decent mexican food in town(since they moved to their bigger/newer loction quality of food has drastically fallen to the wayside)... I finally found a las vegas contender against my OC favorite"el Matador".  The chips(you need to salt these yourself people), beans  and salsa you get when you first arrive are decent(i personally prefer viva mercados).  The salsa is more of a sauce and isn\'t for the types that like their salsa chunky... but it has a very nice smokiness to it.\nThe fideo soup is extremely good...I recommend adding a tbsp of their salsa to it for extra punch...OMG definitely don\'t skip this.\nLast but not least, the main dishes were perfect!  I had the best chile colorado in my life!  The sauce was smooth, flavorful, and all out plate licking good.  The meat was so succulent!  It had been grilled first, and was sooo tender!  they definitely use a much higher quality meat than any other chile colorado in town, and it shows!  The flour tortilla were the pies de resistance... you cannot get fresher!  Hubby said they were as good as his momma\'s tortillas(ran one of the top mex restaurants in So Cal back in the day). Rice was perfectly flavorful, fluffy, and moist(though i was not a fan of the 1 lima bean on top-just don\'t like them LOL). Beans had a little sprinkle of cheese and were perfectly smooth the way i love them.\nHubby had the #9 Janitzio combo - cheese enchilada & beef taco - His favorite 2 things besides chile colorado.  He is a very light eater, and usually doesn\'t finish 1/2 of the food he has.  Not this time!  that enchilada was thoroughly enjoyed.  He said it had the perfect enchilada sauce, in perfect proportion to the cheese, and very fresh tortilla...not drowning on the plate.  His Taco was very flavorful & had a perfectly crisp shell.  the toppings were also in perfect proportions as to not fall all over the place when eaten...mmmm but did that taco have a ton of juice drip when he bit!  you know its moist when they do that!\nAlso, in addition... Service was impeccable, not hovering but whenever we needed a refill or had plates to clear someone appeared.  We eat out all the time, and I drink only ice tea, this place has very fresh ice tea... no bitterness like stale or cheap tea.\nAll in all, this is our new #1 Fav!  No heartburn for 2 days like at Viva Mercados, perfect traditional food.\nWARNING For people that eat at places like Richardo\'s or  chain Mexican restaurants(Gardu\xf1os , Chipotle Mex Grill, Baja Fresh etc.) AKA Tex-Mex, you will not be happy... this is the real deal kinda food for people that appreciate quality.', 'business_id': 'sXEOGcIGsO2_zZXYxVadTw', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2011-03-20', 'type': 'review'}

Coming from the San Francisco area, where good Mexican food is hard to find, this place was a step up with chips and great refried beans served right up, nice Mexican decor, and excellent service.  I started with their Cadillac Margarita with Patron Silver.  Nice size goblet and a nice buzz that lasted the meal.  My girlfriend ordered the "Vampiro" which tasted like slightly alcoholic cool aid.  We sent it back and immediately had it replace with a delicious pina colada.  I had read about their Chile Colorado, a new york cut into pieces in a red sauce(gringos need not worry about it being a spicy sauce) to which I added their flavorful spicy sauce and that did the trick.  I ordered the flour tortillas (I believe they are freshly made, as it tasted that way to me.)   My girlfriend ordered the Mexican combo beef taco, chicken enchilada,  and chile relleno ( The beef taco took first place, chili relleno second, I found it delicious on a taste test, and enchilada a distant third.  Finally, always in search for the authentic churro, it was done right served with small decorative flowered whip cream flowers to dip in.  It was crisp and not overly sweet.   Overall I give this place a B+, as their chili colorado good have been better, perhaps make it bit more flavorful.

It took me a while to go through everything and make a decision, I finally decided on the 2 taco combo (beef tacos) and he got the beef enchilada with green sauce combo.

The food looked good, plates were hot, that's always a good sign. \n\nNow the meal... I took a bite of my taco and it was... a taco. The beef was lacking flavor, it was almost like they didn't season it while cooking, every Mexican restaurant I have been to has always used a combo of onions and other veggies/herbs to season their meat.. it just seemed.. blah. The rice was good, a little on the salty side as well and I usually put salt on everything, I like salt, but it was too salty for even me. my BF and I swapped plates to try each others dishes and his was very good. His beef was good, and it was the same type but since his food was covered lightly with enchilada sauce... i think it helped it out.

There was a Mariachi band playing, but not too loud, and everything just felt comfortable. The decor was bright and festive, but it was not over the top. The thing that we noticed first was that almost everyone eating there was Latino, and that, to us, is always a good sign of authentic food. The food did not disappoint. Everything was so good overall that we came back the next day for lunch before heading back home-- just to get another taste of it. The best of what we tried: the oysters (I am not a fan but my husband ate the heck out of them happily), the cheese fundo, and the guacamole. The warm, homemade tortillas were the best tortillas I have ever had as well, and if I could somehow magically have them at my house every day, I would be eating a steady diet of them. All in all, a good value for the money, a nice experience, and wonderful food.", 'business_id': 'sXEOGcIGsO2_zZXYxVadTw', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2012-08-03', 'type': 'review'}

I found the food to be very blah.\nLet me first say that the service was excellent. The servers were so friendly and checked on us often. If it weren't for them I would have given 2 stars.\n\nThe meal started off with chips, salsa and bean dip. The bean dip was ok but the beans really had no flavor and were very runny. The salsa was horrible.  It was also watery thin and had a weird flavor. After what I heard about this place I was excited to try the salsa but I prefer a chunky fresh salsa and this tastes like something from a can.\n\nThen came a cup of Fideo Soup for us. This was tasty and it had a lot of noodle in it. \n\nFor my meal I had the #4 which consisted of a cheese enchilada, beef taco and a bean tostada with guacamole. Blah blah blah! The enchilada had barely any cheese in it and the sauce they put on top was as nasty and weird tasting as the salsa. The beef taco was cute and small but the beef had no flavor. My tostada had beans and tons of lettuce.. The small of guacamole I had was actually very tasty. I would never order this again I just didn't care for it and the taste. I could have done with out all the lettuce and had more of the other stuff on it.\n\nMy man had Fajitas and he said they weren't as good as Ricardo's or Cabo but he said they were decent. I tried a piece of his flour tortilla and I have to say I should have just ordered a stack of those and some guacamole because the tortillas were good. And the tortillas weren't small either they were a decent size.\n\nThe pic I took and posted on here looks way more appetizing then it really was. I tried to like it but I just honestly didn't :(\n\nThey had a man singing live music which was a nice touch. and happy hour specials  but during happy hour a margarita is still going to run you $4.50.\n\nI don't see when we would be back here since there are other yummy Mexican places around town and especially with Ricardo's just down the street.", 'business_id': 'sXEOGcIGsO2_zZXYxVadTw', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2012-08-08', 'type': 'review'}

There was more of a chicken stock flavor.  For the main course, I ordered the Enchiladas de Mole con Pollo, two cheese enchiladas heated in a red mole sauce with a chicken breast, refried beans, rice, and some lettuce shreds and a dollop of sour cream.  The mole tasted a bit sweet at first but then I got the undertones of the other spices and the richness of the mole came out.  The chicken breast was good.  It was seasoned in any manner so I gave it a good shower of Tapatio.\n\nFor dessert, I got the fried ice cream.  I guess fried ice cream is just something that comes out of the freezer.  I don\'t think anyone "breads" and fries the ice cream in real time anymore.\n\nI was very pleased with my visit.  I was of two minds about where I was seated.  Two men were having a loud discussion (argument?) about politics in Spanish and the one had enough tecate to not know how loudly he was talking.

It honestly looked like they threw some pulled pork on the sizzling plate and tried to pass it off on me. \n\nThe only plus was that the tortillas were freshly made.\n\nI forgot what my friend ordered but when I asked him how his was he just shrugged his shoulders and said, "It\'s ok I guess".\n\nThe service was great and the waiters were very friendly. The salsa was "ok" and the bean dip that came with it was, well, bean dip...nothing "addictive" about it like I saw in another review.\n\nThe lounge singer they had was playing mostly songs from the 80s. \'I Just Called to Say I Love You\' by Lionel Richie? C\'mon, Man. I think he played 2 Mexican songs the whole time we were there. I personally think it was more annoying than entertaining but hey, maybe other people like that kinda stuff.\n\nI probably won\'t be back because it simply wasn\'t worth it.

That was initially impressive! Our waiter was a man named Lorenzo. We ordered drinks, got our chips and salsa/bean dip rather quickly. We ordered our food and from then on it was a 45+  minute wait to receive the food. I think I would have been okay with waiting on the food if I didn\'t notice that all other families that arrived after mine were brought their food right away. Small or larger groups everyone else\'s waiters were ON IT; however, ours was not. I finally could not stand it any longer and approached him to ask if he could bring our food as each plate was ready, versus waiting on all of them to be ready entirely. He seemed annoyed at my comment, but noticing how slow he was moving kept irritating me.\n\nOnce the food arrived, I was starved and shoved everything down. I had a combination plate with Huevos Rancheros. The hand made tortillas that came with the meal were a nice surprise. However, the rice was bland. My huevos rancheros had a weak red sauce with no flavor. I asked around the table, and the variety on our table had burritos and fish combo plates, yet they all agreed that each item was rather bland. \n\nThe alcoholic drink selection although not that large, was very good. I ordered something called "Que Viva la Borrachera" and I have to say that probably saved this entire rating. They packed on the alcohol!\n\nI would consider this place for appetizers and drinks with a friend, but not for a meal.', 'business_id': 'sXEOGcIGsO2_zZXYxVadTw', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2013-05-12', 'type': 'review'}

Viva gives you complimentary fideo soup when requested. If it doesn\'t come with an entree, Bonito charges you $2.50 for it. It\'s good soup but not worth paying $2.50 when it costs probably $.25/cup to make. \n2.) The customer service is off par from the rest. I experienced a rude, short tempered server today at lunch. When I advised my meal came out wrong, he refuted "well this is the way you told me you wanted it!". Well, actually that\'s not the way I told you and I wouldn\'t be telling you it was wrong if you just listened the first time. My last visit, when I asked the question "what is fundido dip?" I was treated like I was stupid for not knowing. It was off putting.\n3.) The busser was kind but she was bad at refilling drinks. My one pet peeve is drink refills. Don\'t keep me hanging....\n4.) The chips and bean dip that come out are bland. Do they use different chips & dip than the other Michoacan resturants? I\'m not certain but they don\'t taste as good here. \n\nThere are good things about the resturant as well - \n\n1.) They have an extensive Mexican themed menu with many options for even the pickest of eaters. My favorites are the beef chimichangas and the beef flour flautas. Their spanish rice is decent and their refried beans are good & consistent. I tried my friends carne asada steak today and it was juicy and yummy. Their homemade flour tortillas are delish!\n2.) They run resonably priced lunch specials. For two of us, we escaped at around $20.00...not bad for a sit down lunch. \n3.) It seemed as though before our tushs hit the seats that there were chips and dip on the table. We were immediately asked what we would like to drink. Very speedy in this regard.\n4.)

Perhaps you\'ve had them before--a pulsing, salivating tingle on the back of your tongue that flows into the mandible and EXPLODES with pent-up desire, thereby forcing a car\'s driver to delete an entire day\'s schedule and head for a Mexican eatery.\n\nAh, life.\n\nThe play? A west side joint called Bonito Michoacan. A cute little corner casita on Chinatown\'s edge, right where Twain kisses Decatur like cousins on a third date: roughly, rudely with nary a care of red lights. I parked the Crown Vic LX with leather interior by the entrance and strolled inside.\n\nPretty empty, but not surprising since it was only 3:30. I sidled by some clucking hostess stand chiquitas and bee-lined it to the bar. Two small screens showing sports and news glowed brightly in the gloom. Baseball on one and something about an airliner that disappeared on the other. I sat at an empty stool while a lassie two places down promptly turned her back to me, feigning interest in the sweaty boys of summer.\n\nA barmaid with gorgeous eyes asked if I wanted a drink and menu. I said yes to both. She brought me a Corona and chips and I ordered sopitos and a carne asada burrito. I ate hot salsa by the chipful as I watched investigators futilely attempt to explain what happened to an airplane. Every once in a while I would glance at the slender back to my left, its owner uninterested in the life of an accomplished and handsome young man. Such a shame. I could have made her so happy. If only for a night....\n\nWhen my half dozen sopitos arrived I promptly dumped my salsa all over discs that held ground beef, chicken and steak. Occasionally I would dab said discs into sour cream or guacamole. What a delight. I asked for Tabasco and doe eyes placed it before me. She saw me eyeing shelved tequila bottles and asked if I wanted a shot. I told her I was unable to drink a single shot because one had an unbreakable habit of turning into six. She laughed and hip swung to the kitchen. When she returned she had my entr\xe9e.\n\nThe carne asada was tender and plentiful, its cavern lightly browned with properly melted cheese. I ordered more beer and enjoyed the rest of the dish. By this time Slender Back had paid her bill and snorted her way past, but not before the barmaid had bade her farewell. \n\nOh, well. Sometimes I\'m just too good looking for people.\n\nAnyway, my bill was twenty bucks and I left five for a tip. Outside I looked at the kissing cousins and turned the car homeward, but not before reminding myself to come again soon. Only next time I would not allow Slender Back to get away so easily....', 'business_id': 'sXEOGcIGsO2_zZXYxVadTw', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2014-04-06', 'type': 'review'}

So let's be fair, when it comes to providing all of the good stuff like tacos and tostadas, you'll find that here. I love the live music and friendly staff, adds to the experience.

We had previously eaten here in May, 2013. That time we enjoyed the meal very much and planned on going back again for a special occasion. This time in no way resembled the previous experience. I had the # 1 combination of chile rellenos, chicken enchilada, and a beef taco. The rellenos was covered in some generic tomato sauce and was bland tasting. The cheese was very stringy and tasteless. The enchilada was so-so and the beef taco was almost Inedible. Beef was dry and the taco shell was hard as a rock. My date had a green chile burrito that had big chunks of pork instead of shredded, the chicken taco also had big chunks of chicken instead of shredded, and her cheese enchilada was basically a tortilla rolled up with sauce and cheese on top. She didn\'t care for any of it. She also ordered sopapillas to be served with our meal, and they showed up 15 minutes after the entree. When we asked where they were the waitress said they were "cooking them fresh".The bean dip was also bland and the chips were stale. Being a Specialty Room Chef in Las Vegas for over 20 years, I know good food. My hunch is that management has sourced cheaper product to cut cost and the quality dropped immensely, or the kitchen staff totally changed and doesn\'t produce the same quality as the staff from last year\'s visit. Lastly the table in our booth wobbled and we felt like we were sitting way to low, with the table height up to chest level because of the worn out seating. Also the music could drop a few decibels. It\'s not a nightclub. Needless to say I would never go back. Chipotle or even Taco Bell would be a preferred dining choice.', 'business_id': 'sXEOGcIGsO2_zZXYxVadTw', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2014-06-24', 'type': 'review'}

It\'s the "go-to" Mexican restaurant for meeting friends in Las Vegas.  I\'ve been four times.  It\'s been excellent every time.\n\nService is outstanding.  Quick friendly seating, attentive waitstaff, and an eagerness to get everything right.  I once had a dish that wasn\'t as hot as I wanted and they fell over themselves to please me -- getting it exactly right the second time.  I don\'t eat onions.  No problema.  I want extra sauce, or sauce on the side, or extra jalapenos.  No problema.\n\nMy latest visit, with my good friend Andrei, was typical.  I had a monstrously large Caldo de Pollo (Chicken Soup) as a dinner.  Wonderfully ample white meat chicken -- at least a breast, maybe a breast and a half.  The cilantro was fresh.  The other spices delicious.  My friends garlic chicken was similarly spectacular -- even without the red peppers he\'s allergic to.  All the chips, salsa, and guac that you could want.  And a price that left money for our main purpose -- playing poker.\n\nI love variety.  And Las Vegas probably has more Mexican restaurants than any city, including Mexico D.F..

This was a perfect way to start our meal,  while we were looking over the menu we were served chips, salsa and beans.   We were starving so that went pretty fast.   We then ordered our entrees,  I ordered the camerones al conac and he ordered camorones dionisio.  We were still hungry after the chips and salsa so we ordered chips and guacamole which they prepare tableside.   (You can definitely tell these servers do the tableside guacamole several times a day) it's nice that they ask if you want all the ingrediants and how spicy you would like your guac.  The guacamole was nice and refreshing with our margaritas.   Then our soup came.   The fideo soup was a small cup of tomatoey brothey noodle goodness,  I finished every last bite.  When our entrees came out, we both finished everything off our plates,  shrimp,  tortillas,  rice,  beans and a dallop of guacamole,  everything was good!   I enjoyed everything from the service to the margaritas to the appetizers to the entrees,  by this time we were pretty full so passed in the desserts,  I definitely recommend this place for the service,  atmosphere and food.", 'business_id': 'sXEOGcIGsO2_zZXYxVadTw', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2015-02-18', 'type': 'review'}

This is the first restaurant I have been to that offered it in their menu and it tasted totally homemade and was incredibly delicious!!

Drove in and the barely found a parking spot so for me was a good sign for also a good pick as well...dropped the ladies off at the front door and parked the car. \n\nAfter checking in with my wife things didn't look so positive...they didn't have our table ready which was very frustrating! I gave them hours notice which in my opinion is totally their fault. I will say the staff was  very friendly and very apologetic about the situation. The managers even came out and bought our whole group a round of drinks and brought the kids lemeonades. Finally after a 25 minute wait we did get seated, but again the manager came over and gave us free table side guacamole and again apologized.  At this point no one remembers the wait my daughters could care less and everyone was having a good time. Our waiter Richard made my daughter feel really special and did an awesome job with her birthday.

We ordered a side of Guacamole and to our surprise, our server Lorenzo brought out all of the ingredients including the fresh avocados and began to prepare it right there at our table.  He seasoned it just to our liking and wow, delicious.\n\nMom and I spooned the fresh guacamole on our burritos, mmm, a nice added spice to an already delicious burrito.\n\nLorenzo was a great server, very attentive to our needs, and of course, our drinks never went dry.\n\nOverall, Bonito Michoacan is an excellent restaurant and we will certainly be back.', 'business_id': 'sXEOGcIGsO2_zZXYxVadTw', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2015-02-24', 'type': 'review'}

Just two years ago when my husband and I discovered it just blocks from the Rio Hotel and Casino, we were thrilled to have a great Mexican meal so close to the strip.  When we ate there in November we thought the food was not the same quality that we had just a few months before Then my daughter and I tried it in February and it was worse.  I ordered the steak Fajitas.  They arrived on a cold plate, not sizzling like they normally do.  There were 9 small pieces of beef, three small pieces of onion and 3/4 of the Fajitas consisted of bell peppers.  The Fajitas were flavorless.  No seasoning, just cooked meat and peppers.  What a disappointment.  We noticed on the menu that if you want more chips and salsa, you must now pay $2.99 for them.  What a ripoff since the bowl of chips is small and was about  1/2 full.  Ricardo's is at the corner of Decatur and Flamingo and I hear it is better thanBointo Michoacan.", 'business_id': 'sXEOGcIGsO2_zZXYxVadTw', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2015-02-26', 'type': 'review'}

I\'ve been going to this place for years now but as I\'ve grown older I\'ve grown to appreciate the amazing food they offer.\n\nThe chips, salsa, and beans they offer as soon as you sit down are always so delicious that I have to limit myself lest I spoil my appetite (I\'m not fancy - I\'ve just always wanted to say "lest"). If I\'m particularly hungry I order the Nopalitos as an appetizer. I absolutely love cactus and the way that it\'s cooked with onions and peppers is amazing and it\'s healthy!\n\nI\'ve had the shrimp cocktail, which has never let me down. The shrimp ceviche is one of my favorites as well. On hangover days I like to go in and get the Fideo soup (I have tried the menudo - I wasn\'t a fan). And nothing cures a hangover like a Michelada! The ones offered here never disappoint! The margaritas are also very good, as well as the Corona Margaritas, but the mixed drinks I\'ve found are way too strong.\n\nThe one dish that I actually had to send back was the Mole. Call me spoiled but once you\'ve tried my mom\'s mole, nothing compares. Mine was too sweet and the meat was too chewy. I sent it back and got a shrimp cocktail.\n\nI guess this place just depends on your taste. Amazing for something things, not so great for others.

Now down to brass tacks:\n\nFood:\nI\'ve been here twice, and the second time was specifically because of how much I loved the food. The green enchilada sauce is amazing, as well as the citrus marinated carnitas. I had some huevos con machaca tonight (breakfast for dinner!) and it was great! Oh! The flour (have not tried the corn yet) tortillas are very good. \nMargaritas are made with fresh squeezed lime juice rather than a bottle or gun of sour mix. Very tasty.\nThe chips are very disappointing and so is the salsa. This is the only reason I could not rate it 5 stars.\n\nService:\nThis is some of the best service I\'ve seen in a while. The staff (bus staff included) truly want to make sure that you have a great time and love every minute.\n\nAtmosphere:\nWhile the typical Mexican restaurant theme is the basis for the atmosphere, it is done well and does not feel "cheesy."

My only issue was the service. Our server was not very friendly and honestly seemed impatient with us when we placed our order. The hostess was nice when we walked in but just the server was not nice. \n\nI enjoyed my Posole and enchilada. Oh and the free chips and salsa were very good too. They also give you free bean dip. \n\nWe did get a free picture with our meal. The girl was trying to sell us photos but when we opted out she gave us our free picture and also seemed annoyed. Oh well. \n\nFor the food in itself I would probably go back but wish the service was better.', 'business_id': 'sXEOGcIGsO2_zZXYxVadTw', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2015-12-21', 'type': 'review'}

So happy I did! From the moment we walked in to the time we left, everything was great!!! To start off, the waitress was super attentive and friendly. \nWe all got the menudo... Yummy! My sister had some type of mango margarita with chamoy that was refreshing and delicious. My dad had a michelada and swore it was one of the best. \nIt's a bit of a drive from the strip but it's worth it! \nWe will definitely be going back when on Vegas!", 'business_id': 'sXEOGcIGsO2_zZXYxVadTw', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2015-12-21', 'type': 'review'}
