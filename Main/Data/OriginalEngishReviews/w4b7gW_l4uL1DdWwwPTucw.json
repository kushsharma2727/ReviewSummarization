Needless to say, after a 10 hour shift at the pool, an awful hockey game, and 2 double jack and diets, I was craving some good mexican food. I used to live in San Diego, so I\'ll admit I can be a little snobbish when it comes to authenticity. So, I\'ll just start with that: this is not authentic, but still tastes good.\nFrom the start I was unsure what they were trying to be. From Flamingo I could see drink-promo banners and a neon "open all night sign".....standard for Vegas. The hostess wearing a flowy, brightly-colored salsa-dance dress led us past the gaming bar, to our booth which had a miniature television tuned to ESPN.  See why I was confused as to their overall goal? But, then they immediately served bean dip and 2 kinds of salsas with slightly stale tortilla chips....but don\'t worry I still ate them all. \nI ordered steak fajitas and the steak, peppers, onions, and sauteed mushrooms (?surprise!) were all very good. The condiments, tortillas, rice and beans, were only so-so. \nOverall, if you are tipsy, hungry, in the area, and its late night.... then its worth a stop-in. But, I wouldn\'t drive out of my way for it. \nHowever, I did grab a handful of Vegas mags on the way out: LV Weekly, Dine Out, Where, and CityLife..... all of which satisfied my Sunday morning coffee-reading ritual.

The chips are pretty fantastic, fresh and not too salty. The mild salsa was like cold tomato soup, but the medium had nice full flavor, though could have been chunkier. The bean dip tasted like bacon fat, and that is kind of a turn off for me. \nMy wife had the veggie fajitas (minus the mushrooms) which tasted very good. I had a Chile relleno and cheese enchilada combo plate. The Relleno was decent, but the chile was super mild and not a lot of flavor. The enchilada was very good, and the sauce was just right, not too overpowering. I also got a Pacifico for $4.25 which wasn't too horrible. \nThe portions are a bit smaller than other Mexican places (the plate filled me up, but I had no leftovers which isn't typical for me), and the prices are a bit high, but if you have a  hankering for some late night eats that won't give you a big of a gut bomb as say Roberto's (which I love, so no trash talk here), this is the place for you.

Mind you he did not bring a kids menu. He was reminded that we had asked for one and he actually said " I thought you were joking".

I was thinking, hmmm, Mexican. Not my favorite cuisine but I was willing  and it's all we could think of last minute. None of us were in the mood for anything else. No sushi, no Mediterranean, no Korean, no Greek... so we settled on Mexican.\n\nThe servers name, and I'm not kidding, was Pancho Villa. He knew that was good for a laugh. Since my friend Joe speaks Spanish we got extra good treatment. Joe had a Margarita and Deb, a beer. There I sat with my water, casually mentioning to Joe that I prefer the frozen style Margarita. He rattled something off to the server and the next thing I knew, I had a frozen Margarita in front of me. Though I don't drink much anymore, I really appreciated that one and it was very well made.\n\nThe chips were really good. Not sure if they make them on the premises but they tasted like they sure could have. I love the chips and salsa thing, even though it tends to destroy your appetite and then you have to fight to get your dinner down.\n\nGreat atmosphere, service and the food was good.

The atmosphere is inviting and cultural, with a comfortable vibe and color everywhere. The booth we were at even had its own little television to watch! I really like the decoration of the place, it definitely invites you into the experience.\n\nUnfortunately, the food was bland at best. The bean dip with chips was okay, but the two other sides of what I thought was salsa and spicy salsa were too watered down and bland. Even the chips themselves didn't have any real kick or substance to them. I ordered the plan bean burrito, in which the rice was very bland and a little mushy. The burrito itself was nothing exciting, and I only ended up finishing half of my meal (and not taking the rest of it home with me).\n\nMy boyfriend ended up finding a long, thick black hair in his food. We immediately told the bus boy, and while it took the manager a good minute to head over to our table, she was nice enough on removing the item from the bill. Our server also gave us a free margarita in place of it. While having a taste of the margarita (and minding they made that margarita kick!), their server either forgot to card him or felt obligated to get him his drink for free. Either way, there is absolutely no reason why he shouldn't have asked for ID in a town like this. That automatically wanted me to drop this review down to a one star.\n\nMy conclusion is this place draws you in with the decor and beauty of the atmosphere, but it doesn't make up for the food. Ricardo's has a lot of potential if they offered new menu items if they decided to revamp what they already have with more flavor.

The food was less than mediocre, our server was extremely rude and there was no one in management to complain about our experience.\n\nThe events are:\n\n1.  No tableware for all of us.\n2.  Server did not know the order numbers per dish although, they are listed in that format on the menu and proudly said, "I don\'t use the numbers. You are going to have to give it to me by the item." After, one gave the order number again, she said, "you are giving me the order number again. I just need the items."\n3.  Server returned and informed they were out of certain foods and asked if we wanted substitutions which we did.  However, she did not ask the person if she wanted a replacement for the soup that was out of stock and walked away.  \nFortunately, the person who ordered soup did not want a replacement.\n4.  Our drinks were not refilled until we asked our bus person (good service) and continued to supply the refills, not the server.\n5.  When food was ready she asked, "who got the one with two enchiladas? Who got the one with the tacos?" Very unprofessional.\n6.  On one order, the cheese on the beans was burnt.\n7.  On another order, there was sour cream although I asked for it not be included. The server questioned and doubted that I made that request. Then she said that they were too busy and the kitchen was making mistakes because of this (many, many empty tables).\n6.  Finally, when presented the bill, we noticed we were overcharged (the substitutions).\n\nThere was an attempt to make a complaint to  management but there was no manager on duty.  The server wanted to speak to the person making the complaint but he was done with her horrible attitude.  She then returned to our table and said, "I am sorry that my service sucked but you could have talk to me about it" as she aggressively picking up our plates.

In honor of Breast Cancer Awareness month, ROSANGEL\u2122, the world\'s premier hibiscus-infused tequila, gave the Margarita a pink hue.  A portion of the event\'s proceeds benefitted Susan G. Komen for the Cure\xae of Southern Nevada.\n\nRicardo\'s and ROSANGEL\'s new Guinness World Record for the "World\'s Largest Pink Margarita" was certified at 7,627 gallons, surpassing the previous record of 7,039 gallons.  To break this record Ricardo\'s used a 14 ft. tall 10 ft. wide tank, 4,600 liters of ROSANGEL Tequila (1,215 gallons), 5,000 gallons of spring water, 750 quarts of Kelly Y Gonzalez lime juice, 750 gallons of La Paz Sweet and Sour, 1,500 liters of triple sec (396 gallons), and 20 pounds of salt.  This record-breaking libation will make a total of 81,355 -12 oz. pink infused margaritas.\n\n"There is nothing more rewarding than being able to involve one\'s profession with charity.  We are truly grateful to have the ability to give back and have people really enjoy themselves.  It\'s a mega-feat for a mega-cause," said Scott Schiller, brand manager for ROSANGEL\u2122.\n\n"We are beyond excited to break the Guinness World Record for the \'World\'s Largest Pink Margarita\'," said Ricardo\'s owner, Bob Ansara. "After over a year of planning this event it is exhilarating to make history and complete this project.  We are so grateful to celebrate 30 years of business and could not think of a better way to celebrate with our community."\n\n"Susan G. Komen Southern Nevada is so grateful for the generosity of Bob Ansara.  Eighteen months ago, he had this grand vision and never once lost sight of the tremendous charitable aspect of this event.  We are honored to have been chosen as the recipient of such benevolence and are truly touched by the friendships we\'ve made," said Stephanie Kirby, executive director of Susan G. Komen for the Cure of Southern Nevada.\n\nThat\'s yet another reason why you should visit them; to claim that you\'ve actually been to a place where a Guinness World Record was set.\n\nTo read the original article and see the photos, click here:\n\nhttp://funbaath.blogspot.com/2010/10/worlds-largest-pink-margarita-guinness.html#more\n\nYou\'ll enjoy the food and the fun!', 'business_id': 'w4b7gW_l4uL1DdWwwPTucw', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2012-06-13', 'type': 'review'}

Tasteless, hard meat.  Two of them.  The beans were fine, but it's hard to screw those up, as was the rice. \n\nOne person had enchiladas, very average enchiladas with very little filling and a whole lot of sauce on top!  Nothing to make your belly smile, that's for sure. \n\nAnother person had the tortilla soup -- and there was NO CHICKEN, but loads of celery!!  Must've been cheap that day . . . it was more of a veggie loaded soup with chicken broth.  \n\nAnother person had the meatball soup (not sure what the proper Mexica name is), but there were TWO tiny meat balls.  That's it.  And a whole lot of dark broth.   \n\nI LOVE chips n salsa -- they also had a bean dip and green salsa, all were pretty good, not the best ever, but enough to have me optimistic about my meal.  The chips were the kind I like, crispy, corny with just enough salt.  It is because of the chips n salsa that this is a 2-star (and not a 1-star) visit.  \n\nThe place was pretty busy for lunch, but most dined at the buffet.  Perhaps that's your best bet.

I\'ll break down this review based off of the items I had to eat & drink.\n\nChips: Were super crisp fresh and delicious.  I found these chips much better than the average fair you find at a Mexican restaurant.\n\nSalsa: They give you three different dips to try.  The bean dip is out of this world delicious, like others have mentioned it is really good.  The green salsa was more of a light Avocado salsa and had a nice flavor and just enough heat. The tomato red salsa was bland and watery with no flavor at all.  Was really disappointed with the red salsa compared to how good the others were.  \n\nCheese Enchilada: Probably one of the BEST I\'ve had in quite awhile. The sauce had a rich deep flavor and the spices were balanced well. The tortilla was not soggy and filled with delicious gooey cheeses. \n\nChicken Taco: The chicken was very flavorful although the tortilla was a little on the stale side.  The toppings were good but very minimal.  \n\nBeans & Rice: One word OUTSTANDING! Really creamy beans that had a nice texture and the rice had some great flavor with the traditional peas in the rice.\n\nMargarita: Had a Mango Margarita and it was average to good.  Nothing to special but nothing bad either.  \n\nOverall a great experience with a very friendly staff.  "Freddie" was a great waiter who was super attentive and funny.

The rice was very soft and the refried beans had no lumps of beans, both of which I liked very much and is not the case with other restaurants.\nThere was only one man there, who acted as host and server, and he treated me like family. He even said, "Would you like chips and salsa, or is it too early?", which I thought was very efficient, and it would be the same thing that I would say at 8AM (of course I answered, "Absolutely").\nI drink a lot of iced tea, and after I downed the first glass in 60 seconds, he put a carafe of it on my table, which is what I would do as well (I ended up drinking two carafes). \nI wish that I brought my i-phone so I could\'ve taken a picture of the combination plate, because the taco shell was not a regular taco shell, but more like a tortilla that was deep-fried. They also took the stem off of the chili relleno, which again, I thought was great, and I can\'t remember any other restaurant doing that.\nI told the waiter exactly what I just wrote, and he was very gracious and said that he would relay my sentiment to the chef.

I was waited on immediately for my beverage order.  I order a marquarita and ice water.  Margarita was very good.  They offer a small, medium and large.  Other reviews commented that their chips, beans and salsa were good.  Their chips come with a guac dip, tomato salsa and beans.  The guac dip and beans were great, but the tomato salsa was very bland; there was no flavor.  The chicken enchilada was very good in flavor.  The chicken could have been cut up a bit more; it was in big chunks.  The carnitas taco was very good.  The rice was full of vegetables - corn, which is typical for Mexican food, but it also had peas, carrots, green beans and lima beans.  I've never had Mexican rice with these vegetables in themn before and did not care for it at all.  The service was good up to the point of getting my check.  It seemed to take forever and I ended up having to ask for it.  I put a credit card in the check holder and after waiting a lengthy time, was presented with a handheld credit card machine where I had to run my own card and punch in my own tip amount and print out my own receipts.

I'm from a small town in Southeast Texas and even the franchise Mexican food in that area is amazing.  Still, I had made a plan with my father and sister to check out Bonito Michoac\xe1n, but when we got there, they had NO parking, in the front or back of the building.  So, we drove down Flamingo and found this restaurant and decided to give it a try instead.\n\nTheir food is pretty good.  Not amazing, but not horrible.  The jalapeno popper appetizer was my favorite item and it's served with a very sweet sauce that complimented it very well.  My chicken quesadilla was good, but my sister and dad both ordered the cheese enchilada meal and while they didn't hate it, they weren't impressed.  At one point, the manager came by our table to check on us and when we mentioned how we'd come by Ricardo's, she screwed up her face and told us that we didn't want to eat at Bonito Michoac\xe1n.

It's sweet with a touch of cinnamon. I prefer it to horchata from some Mexican eateries in Los Angeles, even. When you're seated at a table, you're given tortilla chips and 3 different salsas. The salsas given with the chips are great. One is refried beans; another is avocado-based; the other is tomato-based. My favorite is the avocado-based salsa since it has great flavor and a little spice kick. The chicken tacos at the buffet were awesome. The lady assisting customers at the buffet was so friendly. There were only corn tortillas for tacos, but you can order flour tortillas at your table. I also really enjoyed the rice. It was flavorful without being too salty. The chicken chimichanga is nothing to rave about but still pretty good. For dessert, my party of 4 had split a banana foster. It was a bit too runny for my taste.

There were only 4 other tables occupied. I had been craving a shrimp salad from Lindo's for the past few weeks so I was a bit upset at my husband for not wanting to take me, we were going to catch a movie at the Palms so we needed to eat at a restaurant in close proximity, boo! From what we remembered, the food and service here was good so we drove right over.\n\nWe were seated promptly but we waited a few minutes for our server to appear. My husband and I both ordered waters with lemon and a waiter brought out chips along with bean dip, red salsa, and an avocado salsa. The avocado salsa was the best, they only times I've ever seen it made are at catered parties so that was quite a treat, loved it! \n\nFor my entree I ordered a chicken caesar salad ($10.99), they don't have a shrimp salad which was a let down for me. I asked our server if I could substitute the chicken for shrimp, he said he'd ask the chef and that he'd be right back. I knew that if he agreed I would pay a few more dollars which was fine with me. When the server came back out he said that I would have to be charged $20 for the salad if I wanted it with shrimp, I was expecting to be charged a few more dollars but not almost double, so I stuck with the chicken. My husband ordered a steak chimichanga for his entree. We didn't have to wait long for our food to come out, maybe 15 minutes tops. My salad was topped with cotija cheese which gave it a different flavor, not bad, just different. The chicken was a bit on the dry side but seasoned well, it was your average salad, decent. My husband did not like his entree very much, he said the steak was too fatty which is something he detests. Overall, we were not very pleased with our meals. It was subpar. \n\nNow on to the service. The server didn't even check on us once when he dropped off the food, he only came back to ask if we wanted dessert or the bill. I wanted a flan so I ordered, he came back out with the flan and bill. The flan was bland to me and it had a different texture than what I'm used to, it was not very sweet and if it had caramel, I couldn't taste it, the best part of it was the whipped cream and cherry on top. Overall we spent $28 on our meal which isn't bad but the food isn't that good anymore, I might be back, I might not, for now, I have much better options for mexican food elsewhere.", 'business_id': 'w4b7gW_l4uL1DdWwwPTucw', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2015-01-07', 'type': 'review'}

The chips were fresh and hot, and came with three kinds of salsa - all good.\n\nThe bad:  Most of the food was over-spiced, dry, or both.  I\'ll give them a pass on my food, because I had the lunch buffet.  The buffet was pretty much indistinguishable from the Mexican station at any hotel buffet.  But my wife\'s combination meal off the menu was pretty much the same.  She also ordered some cheese-only nachos, which had obviously spent too much time under the broiler and tasted burnt. \n\nWe will give Ricardo\'s another chance, but for now I can\'t say that this is the "treasure" of a Mexican restaurant that we always hope to find when we try a new one.', 'business_id': 'w4b7gW_l4uL1DdWwwPTucw', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2015-01-10', 'type': 'review'}

You get to know the owners a bit, see how hard they're working, and you just don't have the heart to write a bad Yelp review.  Luckily for all parties involved, Ricardo's has been around for decades, which means that my little Yelp review won't make the slightest dent in their future.  But hopefully it will make a few foodies out there think twice about going.\n\nWant good Mexican?  Don't go to Ricardo's.  First came out a giant bowl of free chips & salsas - ranchero, tomato, and some green sauce.  Red salsa was OK, green salsa was yucky, ranchero (what's in it?) was the best of the three, but that's not saying much.  Also, I have a really low salt taste, and the chips were actually under-salted to me.  I got the guacamole appetizer, which was pretty good, I guess (I haven't had guacamole in a really great Mex restaurant).  I got the Chile Colorado, short ribs cooked in red chilies, onions & spices - OK, but too salty for my low-salt-taste palate.  Unfortunately, I was burping this dish back up all the next day (sorry if that was TMI).  For dessert, crazy bananas - hot bananas cooked in caramel syrup with vanilla ice cream and chocolate (although I nixed the chocolate).  Too sweet, not great, like something you would get from TGIFriday's Mexican menu.\n\nI have to commend Ricardo's on their service, which was absolutely first-rate.  In fact, it was so good that I held off writing this downer of a review for a few days.  I got to Ricardo's after 1 a.m., and pleasant, friendly, attentive service during graveyard shift is about as hard to find in Las Vegas as an un-augmented dancer at the Rhino.  Ricardo's clearly believes in taking care of their customers, and gotta say, the portions were very large.  Huge portions plus a great staff have kept Ricardo's going through thick & thin (and there's been plenty of thin) for over three decades.

I ate a ton of food, and it looked like I didn\'t touch my nachos.  The waitress actually came over and said "You didn\'t like them?"  No...there\'s just WAY too much food on the plate!  They tasted ok, but I\'ve had better at Qdoba. \n\nMorgan wasn\'t impressed with his, either.  The enchilada was good, but we make better at home.  The carnitas taco was bland.  \n\nService was awkward too...our waitress was nice, but had 0 personality.  She disappeared at random times, and the checked on us twice within about 3 minutes...space it out! Its ok to let us eat for a minute.  Really.\n\nFood was pricey for the quality.   I don\'t know that I\'d come back for anything other than a margarita during happy hour.', 'business_id': 'w4b7gW_l4uL1DdWwwPTucw', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2015-06-19', 'type': 'review'}

She said It had to be over $50 and my check happened to total $49.83... She said it had to be over $50  before tax (huh? Tax on food? Guess I never payed any attention to that before). She rang me up a small drink worth about $2 but charged me $10. My new bill after my gift card now totaled $35. It's actually quite hard to spend $50 here for two people, everything is priced pretty fairly.\nAlso:   Literally all of the other restaurants I've used these gift cards at don't even care if you don't meet the minimum purchase requirement.\nHonestly the whole gift card thing wouldn't have even bothered me if it wasn't for her absolute terrible manor how she talks to her customers. \nIf you are the owner/manager reading this: Fire her asap.", 'business_id': 'w4b7gW_l4uL1DdWwwPTucw', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2015-12-12', 'type': 'review'}
