We went for takeout so we couldn't really judge the service but the guy that seats you was really nice and helpful.\n\nMy coworker recommended the salt and pepper pork chops.  Since I had always been told by my ever-so-seasoned fellow yelper/coworker reggie to always order salt and pepper anything whenever I can, I agreed to try said pork chops.  After about a 15 minute wait, the waiter brought out our food.  It smelled great and I couldn't wait to get home to try it.  I opened up the to-go box and there were small breaded pork chops (some with bone, some without) that had bits of garlic and jalepeno all throughout the dish.  It came with rice as well.  When I dug in I couldn't believe how tender they were.  These pork chops just melted away in my mouth.  The contrast of the jalepeno against the pork was incredible with just the right amount of heat and saltiness.  All in all it was a great dish and I would definitely go back.  They had a lobster sale while we were there...19.95/lb down from 29.95/lb and these things were monsters!

Hands down. Every time I have friends in town and they want to eat good off the strip Chinese food, this is place we go. Its open around lunch time and closes super late, 11am-3am. When I first walked into this place, I saw a good sign. Tons and tons of other Asian families eating here. The menu is pretty extensive and also has pictures for the newbies.\n\nWe ordered: Salt and Pepper Pork Chops, Pan Fried Sea Bass, Roast Duck, Salt and Pepper Sea Bass, Spicy String Beans with Chicken, Garlic Ong Choy, and some Oyster Clay Pot.\n\nWow. I was definitely amazed by the taste and quality of the food. The Salt and Pepper Pork Chops are definitely different from the other restaurants. Instead of battering the pork and deep frying it, they do it in a way that the batter isn't fried in. Its like a separate layer above the meat so you can taste both parts when you bite into it. Its weird to explain but its good. So good, that we order it every time we go there. \n\nThe Pan Fried Sea Bass is my absolute favorite. The lightly fried sea bass comes swimming in sweet soy sauce but it doesn't overpower the taste nor the light crisp. Definitely a must order.\n\nThe Roast Duck here is waaaaaay better than at Sam Woo BBQ. The dish here actually has large chunks of meat. It has a right combination of crispy skin and meaty meat. That's the way this dish should be served.\n\nThe Salt and Pepper Sea Bass was good but not a must have. The Spicy String Beans with Pork was good also.... But not a must have. I would probably order other dishes the next time I'm here.\n\nThe Oyster Clay Pot was surprisingly filled with..... Lots of oysters! It comes with roast port, fried tofu, and lots of oysters. Definitely a must have if you like this kind of dish.\n\nLast but not least, the Garlic Ong Choy is one of my favorite veggie dishes. It was cooked perfectly. The leafy part was soft, yet not overcooked, and the stems were slightly crunchy in texture.\n\nThis place is great. I highly recommended it. Funny thing is when I ask my coworkers where they go to get good Chinese food, they always say Joyful House. I felt like I was the last one in on this wonderful secret.

So there was a small possibility that I might have had a shellfish allergy, but after my 6lb plate of deep fried lobster perfection, I think I can rest easy now.\n\nMan, I had forgotten how great this place is for seafood.  Despite being "only kinda hungry" my group of four proceeded to order a 6lb deep fried lobster, XO beans, ong choy, soup, and steamed fish.  \n\nThis is one of the best lobsters I\'ve ever had.  Lightly dusted in cornstarch, salt, pepper, and crack(?), then quickly fried to perfection keeping the meat moist and succulent.  The pictures speak for themselves.  Plus they were having a 50% off special on lobster, so our titanic crustacean only cost us $100. \n\nThe only disappointment was the fish, not because it wasn\'t good, but because we had no idea it cost $59/lb!  That 1.5lb cost us as much as the lobster and wasn\'t worth it.  Next time we\'ll be sure to ask how much the fish costs before we order.  \n\nOther than that, a perfect meal.', 'business_id': 'zFcd_gelAUEwAvJOgiZpvg', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2009-07-16', 'type': 'review'}

The meat was fine.\n\n5) Pan Fried Spinach in Garlic Sauce - Simple and good.\n\n6) Wonton Noodle Soup - Good, but pricey.\n\nI enjoyed our meal and the service was not bad with the exception of my drink order.

The menus are easy to read with the set dinners on the very first page, but if you feel adventurous, I would suggest the more foreign dishes to eat. They are truly authentic, serving black fungus and jellyfish, shark fin soup, among other things. Most Americans would never order these dishes, but trust me--you have to try it.\n\nWe ate the honey walnut shrimp (obviously), black fungus and season vegetables, braised tofu, wonton noodle soup, and jelly fish.

A large center slice of Seabass. Just lovely.\n\nWe also had the Sauteed Prawns in Spicy Sweet and Sour Sauce which was very good.  in addition to the incredible menu choices, they have several live seafood tanks with a variety of seafood; prawns, geoduck, shellfish, other live fish.  \n\nAtmosphere was marred by this random table in the middle of the walkway heading to our booth - this oddly placed table was covered in clean restaurant dishes, glasses, napkins, and brickabrack of things that are usually hidden at the back or behind a divider, not sitting in the middle of the restaurant.

From glowing reviews, I was stoked about a great seafood meal, perhaps like I had while living in China for 10 years.  Pity.  No such luck.  The char su (bbq pork) was lean, alright, but chewy like jerky.  And cold.  Noodles were served immediately, when any self-respecting Chinese restaurant owner knows that the "pasta is served at the end!"  At least along side the steamed fish.  Pacing is critical in a good Chinese restaurant with courses arriving at appropriate intervals.  The \'highly recommended\' shrimp dish was laden with red sauce.  Very Midwestern and sweet - with all due respect to my Midwestern friends, whose steak and pizza I adore.  In a word, "Fake".  And not cheap!  It may be worth a second try, but I may venture to other places along Spring Mountain to find a great kitchen.  Not the best way to begin the Year of the Rabbit.

My best friend, her family and I came here around 10:30pm. It had been ages since my last visit (I think I was 10 years old or so) ,so I couldn't exactly remember what the food tasted like, but at the moment I was up for anything in the Chinatown area. \n\nWe ordered: \n\nCream of Chicken and Corn Soup- pretty standard soup. It reminded me of egg flower soup with cream of corn. I don't know if I'd order this again because it wasn't anything special. I think I'd prefer won ton soup over this. \n\n\nBeef & Broccoli- I was a little skeptical about ordering this dish because I always try to order things that you can't get at other places. This dish you can order anywhere and I was sort of sick of it from places like Panda. However, that is only due to the fact that I forgot how much better it tastes at authentic Chinese restaurants. Beef was chewy and tender, while the stems of the broccoli was soft. The sauce was typical and there was a perfect amount to moisten the dish up and I'm tough critic when it comes to dryness. I couldn't believe at how much the dish amazed me as if it was my first time trying it. \n\nHoney Walnut Shrimp- one of my all time favorites at any Chinese restaurants. Joyful House will not disappoint because theirs definitely meets the standards. The batter of the shrimp was the perfect thickness, good ratio of shrimp to walnut and the mayonnaise glazed the entire dish perfectly. Loved this! \n\nSteamed Flounder- just as good as it is anywhere else. My dad also cooks this at home and now I honestly don't find this dish as amusing as I did before. But I'm sure for everyone else they still love it. The fish is very light that is balanced with the soy sauce and oil. The chopped scallions also adds a nice touch, almost like sprinkles on a sundae. On another note, the fish came with all the bones intact and the server meticulously de boned the entire fish at the table. I was truly impressed because the fish still held up it's shape and it wasn't distorted into pieces (if that was my job, it would have been another story). My best friend and I both chatted about how it was our first time experiencing such an art. Apparently all Chinese restaurants are suppose to do this. \n\nThank you Joyful House! I was so caught up with the hype of other Asian cuisines from sushi to banh mis that I had forgotten the Chinese were the first to make a good impression on Americans. No wonder, your food is absolutely delicious and will always be considered the Asian classic.

A number of the clams were cracked (did they drop them from high above into the wok???) and the sauce could have used a few more black beans.\n\nService was attentive, possibly because there were only 2-3 tables occupied by the time things got rolling for us.

I ate some more and found 2 pieces of pork. What the hell is this?! Under no circumstances should this be acceptable. This is a sign of an unsanitary restaurant.  I immediately stopped eating. I still paid and tipped as usually. I don't know why I still didn't make a big deal out of this experience. Well I sure as hell did once my stomach started to churn about 10 minutes after leaving. I spoke to a family member who said that her Chinese friend told her that even if a Chinese restaurant says that a dish is vegetarian, chances are that they're still cooked in lard.

Let me just say, this is one of the best Chinese seafood restaurants I've tried so far, and I've tried a lot!\n\nI love that the tables are wide apart and not squished together. There's plenty of space to walk in and you don't have to suck yourself in to move in between seats. The decoration is not shabby, but not good. The place is very clean though. \n\nI ordered the Sizzling Rice Soup, Tofu and Eggplant stuffed with Shrimp Paste, Fried Tofu with S/P, Honey Walnut Shrimp, and Half a Chicken W/ Ginger Sauce.\n\nThe Sizzling Rice Soup tasted of MSG, but I haven't tasted one seafood restaurant that doesn't make it taste like MSG. But the sizzling rice was greeeat, and the seafood was very, very fresh. The Tofu and Eggplant stuffed with shrimp paste was deliciouuus. I eat this all the time and this is one of the best places I have ever tasted it at. The stuffing is great, it's packed with flavor and the eggplant and tofu were soft but not falling apart. The Honey Walnut Shrimp.. Mmmm, delicious. My favorite dish there. I love that they don't go heavy on the mayonnaise and they keep the dish light and flavorful. The shrimp is super crunchy, unlike many places. The chicken was great. It was a little bit dry but I loved the flavor they got into the chicken, and that was without the ginger sauce! The Fried Tofu was good too! The skin was very thin but super crunchy and the whole tofu kind of just melts in your mouth. Although this isn't a dish, I just have to compliment it.. We asked for fresh chili and they give us chili, with soy sauce, and fried garlic. I don't know what else they put in it, but it was delicious.. Wow, so great! \n\nService was quick, everything was brought to us in a blink of an eye! Loved that. They were friendly and informative. \n\nPrices are very steep here though, especially when you compare it to the portion of the dish. But the quality of the food here is superb, at least when I came. Everything was tender, fresh, juicy and delicious! I will definitely come back and try the Peking Duck.", 'business_id': 'zFcd_gelAUEwAvJOgiZpvg', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2012-08-06', 'type': 'review'}

I mean real Chinese foods. So I decide to search the Yelp and find Joyful House Chinese restaurant. Am I lucky? The food and service are excellent and no doubt to recommend this place.\n\nMy friends and I ordered a steam red big eye fish. The fish is made just right. If you know how to make a traditional Chinese steam fish, you know it is important to have good quality of fish, have to be fresh, and also the timing to steam the fish has to be just right, not too long or too short. We also have the coral shrimp, those shrimps are fresh and  tastes sweet. We also tried the lobster as well - I mean those over 4 lbs lobster. The lobster meat is fresh and tastes very good, can\'t get it from somewhere else. \n\nAnother dish that we ordered is black bean sauce clams, it is amazingly good. They are juicy, tender and "big" as a clam. I never taste such a clam before. As Chinese, we got to order a dish of vegetable - garlic baby bean sprout (the leafy ones.)\n\nAs far as the space, as other described, they are spacious and sit comfortably for a big group. Very clean place. Decoration is ok.\n\nThe service is excellent. The waiter and waitress all are friendly and answer all our questions. The food is served promptly. They even serve complimentary dessert as well.\n\nIf you are looking for Chinese foods and wants to get away from the Stripe.

I'm not a huge lover of true Asian food - for example, my favorite Chinese food is served at Panda Express. Despite my best intentions, I typically balk at the stuff people actually eat in places like Vietnam and Taiwan. You can understand why I was a little leery of venturing to a Chinese place on Spring Mountain for dinner with my coworkers the other night, especially when it was recommended by the Taiwanese guy! I consulted with him and he assured me that 'americans' like myself would still be able to find something to eat at Joyful House, so we decided to check it out. \n\nThe restaurant is quite large and well-lit, with a bunch of (like 15) tanks for fresh seafood that you can see. It seemed like a pretty legit operation and my coworker was already conversing in mandarin (or something) with the friendly wait staff, so we knew we'd be treated to a wide variety of dishes.\n\nSpeaking of wide variety, everybody ordered a bunch of stuff and then my coworker spoke to the waiter and apparently ordered like 6 more dishes. Everything is family style, so we had waaaayyyy too much food, even for our large group of like 12. Here's a quick run down:\n\nGarlic Baby Bok-Choy - loved it. Not bland like your usual veggie dishes. Highly recommend.\nMandarin pork chop - the favorite of several people at the table. Sweet and breaded, which is my fave.\nSizzling steak - just ok. We were pretty pumped after the sizzling presentation, but it wasn't anything special. Not spicy (despite the warning on the menu).\nClay pot scallops - served with rice noodles and really good.\nSeafood dish - don't know what it was called, but I really liked it. It came with shrimp, crispy noodles, and some other stuff I can't remember. My 2nd fave.\nClay pot eggplant - good not great.\nPork fried rice - standard.\nString beans with pork - good not great.\nAppetizer soup - just the soup they serve to everybody, I guess - beef broth with nothing in it. It was as good as you can make beef broth, but the 1 year old LOVED it, so bonus for that.\nTapioca Dessert Soup - no thank you. If you're into tapioca, you might like it.\nLemon iced tea - really good! Sweetened, but not too sweet. I actually had two glasses, which I usually don't do.\n \nPrices were kinda high - $15-20/meat dish, but everything was good, including the service.\n \nAny time I have somebody in town craving a 'fancier' Chinese meal, we will definitely take them to Joyful House.\n \nBonus points for being open late (til like 3am)!", 'business_id': 'zFcd_gelAUEwAvJOgiZpvg', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2013-04-08', 'type': 'review'}

To be fair, the food is, for the most part, decent to very good. They do serve complimentary jasmine rice, which not every place would have. Jasmine is very fragrant and less starchy than say, a long grain calrose. It does cost more and better, at least I think so. Along with complimentary hot tea.

Heard good things abut them so coming here was a no brainer.\n\nI gotta give them props for their menu. It looks like they put a lot of thought and detail into it. For example, if you were craving a certain item like soup, bam! All the soups they have are all in one section. This applies to all others like noodles, seafood, etc. We ordered Salt n Pepper Calamari, Salt n Pepper Porkchops, and Honey Walnut Shrimp. \n\nThe Honey Walnut Shrimp was decent, but to me it seemed to lack a bit of sauce to it. When we got the plate, it already looked like somebody ate some shrimp off of it. If you refer to my picture, you can see that they don't give you much shrimp to begin with. The best Honey Walnut Shrimp I ever had was at Panda Inn in the city of La Palma, Ca. \n\nBoth the Salt n Pepper Porkchops and Salt n Pepper Calamari was very good. The only thing lacking I thought was some kind of sauce to dip it in. There was soy sauce on the table but that will only add to the saltiness of the two entrees. I was thinking sweet n sour sauce would be perfect to dip it in. \n\nService was very good. They took our order and processed it right away. We got our food in no time. Refills were constant and im glad because of the salt content we ordered which was good with the steamed rice we ate it with.\n\nThe main negative thing that stood out for me was the prices. With all the three items we ordered plus tax it came out to 41 dollars and that's without any drinks (we had water which was good because it was filtered and not tap water). I thought the food was good but 15 bucks a pop for the Honey Walnut Shrimp and the Salt n Pepper Porkchops is bit much. Even the appetizer Salt n Pepper Calamari was 8.99. \n\nAll in all I thought it was an ok experience based off of the negatives and positives that balanced each other out.

It really has almost no flavor on it's own but does have a most interesting delicate texture and is suppose to be extremely beneficial to your health.

I suggest to "just pick any place...    I\'m sure it will either be Awesome or it will at least be a story"...       Now the sound of screeching tires...   a wild left turn from the right lane and we were there...    at Joyful House.\n\nOnce we thanked the gods that we were still alive...  we checked the yelp reviews...      a lot of them... and a really good average.  Alright, looking forward to this.\n\nSo the place is kinda what I was hoping for...     something that didn\'t look like a high over-head "Asian Fusion" type place like PF Changs (all do respect to PF...   I do love the Mongolian beef)...   it\'s simple and to the point...    kinda like a dinner.  Think denny\'s.   We got seated right away and menus came out to us...   we started looking at stuff but noticed that on the first page were three combo set dinner options...   we made it easy and ordered option 1...( We are not picky...  no food allergies...     we were just hungry)\n\nOh My God...    Come HUNGRY\n\nOut comes tea...     that\'s cool...   then a very large bowl of soup...Sooooo tasty.   \n\nNext egg rolls, dumplings, and other assorted fried goodies.....     MMmmmmmmm\n\nOk now rice.   Not a little but a huge plate of the rice along with chicken chow mien...     man...    there was a lot of food....  but wait there\'s more\n\nTwo more huge family style plates of noodles and sweet and sour chicken.   Table now covered in food...  and good food.   We ate and we ate but alas...   we barely ate half of it.    \n\nListen if you\'re looking for the Vegas Strip style place...   this is not your place.   If you want to be seated and fed in a relaxed, local and unpretentious place, then give this a shot.   \n\nI\'ve read some of the other reviews about the bland food and what not and I feel bad for those people that they had a bad experience.    Clearly they came on an off day because what we got was great....     \n\nNow I just need to go and digest....     \n\nSoooooo   Fuuuuuuullllll\n\nPS    My fortune cookie was empty...

I also remember that it was quite good, although I again cannot remember at all what I had.  I'm sure they were fairly typical dishes such as mushu or kung pao or something.  Recalling that they were good and being in the mood for Chinese, we made our way here for lunch.\n\nFirst of all, no lunch menu on weekends.  We got the menu of dozen pages or so that were just normal dinner dishes - fairly expensive dishes.  Fortunately we were not looking for a lunch menu and wanted the full gamut so it didn't faze us any, but be prepared that it will not be a cheap lunch.  The menu you do get is upscale in both the menu itself and the contents with right balances of seafood and non-seafood.  \n\nI was craving some Chinese seafood so we ordered the Seafood Wor Wonton Soup ($10), marinated spicy clams ($14), and sweet & sour crispy rock cod fish ($14).  The soup had plenty of fat wontons and ample amount of seafood, and with the large size it's well worth the price.  Spicy clams were in deep red, spicy sauce, with a hint of mala tingliness.  Loved it.  The sweet & sour was not too sweet, not too sour, with perfectly fried fish that was as tender as can be.  As good as the first two were, this was even better.  With enough unusual items on the menu, this may very well be our go-to Chinese.\n\nOur meal came to $50 after all was said and done, but it was the best Chinese we've had in a long, long time.  Service was more pleasant than the typical Chinese restaurants, although it's all relative.  Food came fast, restaurant is clean, and traffic was brisk.  I'm torn between 4 & 5-stars, but let's leave it at 4 until I revisit.  It's really 4.5 stars.\n\nTable-for-1 Factor:  Despite the large table-centric set up, I think the atmosphere might actually work for 1.

It's a large book full of items that will satisfy those looking for authentic fare and those looking for Chinese-American food -- the kind you can get from any corner take out spot.\n\nKung pao chicken was heavy on sauce, but a decent portion size with plenty of chicken, green peppers and nuts. Shrimp fried rice was light on ingredients (other than rice) but the flavors were solid. If you're a fan of bok choy, the mushroom and bok choy dish had just enough sauce to let the ingredients shine while enhancing their flavors. My favorite dish of the night was the tender, well seasoned beef in oyster sauce with green onions. I loved the flavors of the sauteed green beans, too with it's subtle use of heat and minimal amounts of oil. If fish is your thing, try the seabass. Flakey and delicate, it was a well executed dish with a light buttery flavor. Not as successful was the house fried half chicken. The skin was perfectly wafer thin and crispy, but the meat was bland and dry as a bone.\n\nPerfect for large parties, it's also great for families.

The restaurant had about two tables filled, now three once we all sat down. Must be a good place if there are people here eating Chinese food instead of on the strip at midnight. We ordered soft noodles, salt and pepper pork, minced beef with tofu and sizzling beef (came on a hot plate). All of the food arrived at the table family style and freshly made-- just what I was craving for! It was delicious and I would definitely come back again. I especially like how late the Joyful House stays open and how accommodating the service was. Our drinks were never empty and our server brought more rice the moment I scarfed it all down. We definitely felt welcomed, even when it was probably past our server's bed time (and mine, too!) \n\nI definitely recommend this place to anyone who might be visiting Las Vegas and craves some authentic Chinese food-- not that greasy chow mein from a fast food chain or the 'meh' broccoli and beef from a tray at a casino buffet.

Me and the fiance were grocery shopping and saw joyful and went for it! We were seated immediately, very clean and bright seating area. They have tanks which are filled with shrimp, lobster, crabs, and fish in the main seating area. The staff is very friendly, and we're then offered some complimentary tea. It was great, very smooth and not o er brewed by any  means. With a light and subtle flavor it went perfectly with our meal which consisted of crispy fried salt and pepper tofu, Mongolian beef, and honey walnut shrimp. The crispy fried tofu was done to perfection. Great texture of crunch, the seasoning was done with perfect balance and wasn't to salty or peppery. I almost ate the whole dish to myself lol! We then got our Mongolian beef and honey walnut shrimp. I can say that the flavor of these two dishes were,the best that we have had. The only downside would be the texture of the beef. For us it could have been fried a little lo,her to get a nice crisp texture on the outside, but non the less the flavor was there and it didn't hinder us, with the jasmine rice It was awesome! Bow on to the honey walnut shrimp, THE BEST!!  Crazy but it really wast the best honey walnut shrimp we have ever had. The shrimp had a nice fried coating. The shrimp itself was savory. The dish hot it's sweetness from the walnuts. It seems like the walnuts were roasted with honey and honey alone. Mixed with fried shrimp and tossed with a light coating of mayo. What a surprise. I was expecting an overly sweet, saucey dish. But it was a great balance of sweet and savory. Everything went well and ended with teat which was a nice way to end our meal. The entire meal was above our expectations and gives US a reason to come back. The portions to me are a little small for the price but what you get back in flavor is awesome.", 'business_id': 'zFcd_gelAUEwAvJOgiZpvg', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2015-03-15', 'type': 'review'}

My friends & I just finished our epic spartan race and idk why but my cravings for Panda Express Orange Chicken were going on overboost. However, my friends all said that the Panda Express on the strip (the only one open that late) wasn't as good as back in OC. I ain't about to waste my calories on crappy chinese food so luckily one of my friends that live in Vegas recommended Joyful House.\n\nI was surprised walking in that there were still families eating so late, so place must be good. The workers here speak english, but if you want any modifications you better know your chinese. Thank god they spoke cantonese so I busted my chinese speakin skills on them lol\n\nWonton soup - Started off w/ this, I liked that it was just the soup w/ veggies, wontons, and bbq pork. NO NOODLES YAY! It was a very big portion, but flavor was on point and no salty MSG. In fact, their soup was actually on the lighter side and not greasy. The BBQ Pork was lean and surprisingly one of the best I've had.\n\nHoney Walnut Shrimp - Busted my chinese to ask for mayo on the side and thank god I did! I recommend you try asking for the sauce on the side also, it makes a big difference. The shrimp was all nice and crispy, not leaking out oil at all from the batter. I think that if the sauce was on it, it'd make the shrimp soggy. Very good dish and they didn't skimp on the shrimp either! We still had half the plate left to take home. The shrimp were a good medium size, not overly coated in batter\n\nCrispy Orange Chicken - I wished it were a bit more crispy, didn't really satisfy my Panda Express cravings, but can't complain. The sauce wasn't the same as Panda either, but more like a traditional Orange Chicken flavor you'd get at asian restaurants like Sam Woo. It tastes great w/ the steamed white rice. I would say skip this and try another entree, it's not a TDF item\n\nYang Chow Fried Rice - Fried rice w/ BBQ pork & Shrimp! You can get it chinese style which is Plain, Soy Sauce Free - Pan fried with Eggs and Shredded Cabbage, or American Style which has soy sauce. The fried rice was pretty good and again the BBQ pork was delicious! Really big portion, we had to take the rest home. Unlike most chinese restaurants, they didn't skimp on the bbq pork and shrimp! It wasn't too greasy either so brownie points for that\n\nThey give you sweet and refreshing orange slices at the end of your meal which helped the hefty meal go down! Our total bill came out to be about $50 w/ tax which isn't bad. It's a great place for value, you get a lot for what you pay!
