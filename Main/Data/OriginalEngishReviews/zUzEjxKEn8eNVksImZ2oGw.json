Drinks are also about half the price that you'd pay elsewhere.\n\nWhat I really came for, though, was the food.  I'd heard it was tasty, inventive, sort-of-authentic Mexican food.  I loved it!  I ordered the Patatas Gratinadas, a dish made with sweet potatoes, lots of cheese, and chipotle, served piping hot.  I also tried (devoured, actually) a friend's Frijoles con Queso, a cheesy bean dip.  They also make their own yummy tortilla chips.  What really struck me, though, was that they charged dive bar prices for great food!\n\nThe decor was great and the service was friendly. It got really crowded towards the end of our visit, with a wide variety of customers. I can't wait to go back, sit on the (soon to be heated) patio, and try more drinks and menu items.

Kept hearing about in via word of mouth, so grabbed the 86B and strolled down the hill. \n\nGiven neighborhood, I initially confused the place, for someone having a lively houseparty. An old head-high fence and hanging lamps with their illumination filtering through the wood beams.\n\nThe crowd is not what I call a traditional "hipster" crowd that you may encounter  a la Brillobox. More "mature" if that has any meaning nowadays. The front bar area was small, but never gave off the impression of sardine packed-in-ed-ness. What appealed to me the most is the general sociability of the place. They talk to strangers here, and while that may be tied to the people than the place, per se, it adds to it, imho.\n\nAll waitresses/servers are *amazingly* hot and friendly. Grabbed a seat. Drank two caipirinhas and a hopdevil. Packed full of kick. Mason jars, are strange to drink out of, unless you are from the south or Missouri.  I have no such problem, and it gives off a very down-to-earth air that I would expect out of Lawrenceville. Costs seem to be "midling." 6-7 bucks for some of the drinks. That is not huge to me, but may be to others.\n\nMenu looked tasty, and had some Spanish and Mexican beers I ran into during my foreign travels.  Did not sample food menu, but will in the future. \n\nA great jukebox, and given the sensitivity of my ears, the volume was not too too bad...for a while. Later on that night, not sure if they cut it higher or if certain albums play louder than others. It seemed less of a problem than other places in terms of sheer "blast."\n\nThere appears to be a secondary room of tables and chairs behind the front bar area, and going further to the rear of the establishment and up the hill is an intriguing grassy patio area. Did not explore that, because I\'m a friendless wuss who is afraid of looking like a loser, but if you come with 5+ folk, you may want to snag a spot out there early and see what stars you may be able in amongst all the air pollution.\n\nThis is close to a 5, but I only gave 4 due to the slowness of getting served at times. It seems like there is no bar to serve clients on the rear-patio area; the two ladies in the front were very busy cranking out drinks for all, so I could not fault them for the time it took. The time was due to the crush, versus indicative of any rudeness or lack of attentiveness. If they could resolve that, or add more barstaff, I think it would tip it over into perfection.\n\nThis place has character, good service, good people, and thankfully is a work in progress.', 'business_id': 'zUzEjxKEn8eNVksImZ2oGw', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2009-10-09', 'type': 'review'}

The food was tasty and although the menu was short, they had a diverse selection with thoughtful flavor ideas.  I finished my meal without the bartender checking on me to see how things were or if I needed anything.  At the end I asked about taking my chips and bean dip home and the bartender informed me that they don\'t have take-out containers because they don\'t serve food to-go.  "Sorryyyyyy" she said as if I was supposed to throw my food away or put in in my pocket.  I ended up scooping the dip into foil and putting the chips in a bag.  I also made a suggestion to a woman with short hair next to me (seemed to be doing managerial things) that they should post their kitchen hours on their site since they differ from their operating hours.  She asked me "WHY?" in a snotty tone and I explained that since they don\'t answer their phone (their voicemail tells you to email them!?!) I was not sure if I would be able to eat.  I don\'t drink alcohol and my primary concern on Monday nights is checking out new restaurants.  Had I come down and their kitchen was not open I would be giving RCC even less stars.

It simply was slammed.  Front bar was full and surrounding handful of tables.  The back room, which has around 10 tables was also full.  There is no list and much less reservations.  This was very frustrating, jockeying for position to take a table when it opened up only to have the one person in front of you suddenly have their 8 friends show up and take all of the open tables.  We ended up waiting an hour for a table for four.\n\nNot much of a scene, it really didn't seem like a lawrenceville crowd at all... definitely mostly people from Shadyside or the burbs driving their BMWs down to the new hip spot.\n\nI must say though, once the food came, all my angst regarding seating and pretentious other customers melted away.  We started with guacomole and salsa, both of which were simply superb.  The guac was simple, but creamy and satisfying.  The salsa was full of roasted poblano goodness.\n\nThe menu is around 15 items from $5-$12.  The bulk of it are corn-tortilla tacos with various other offerings.\n\nThen my tacos came.  Good lord, I am so glad I ordered the pork belly.  Each taco had a healthy serving of pork belly covered in a spicy roasted, smoky sauce, onions, celantro, apple, radish and queso fresco.  I really wish I could eat these everyday.  At $8, the price was right for a sit down restaurant, but I do wish I could find these for lunch somewhere for $6.\n\nSo, all in all, the food and service was excellent.  The scene and having to jockey for a table for an hour really left me grumpy and will make me think twice about going again.\n\nLsatly, to the table of 3 who had finished their food when we got there, and were still at their table 2 hours later when we left.  If anyone from that group is reading this, what a low-life sitting there watching others wait for a table while you sip your drink and laugh about the wallpaper and run your hands through your stupid balding head of curly hair.  Go get a drink somewhere else and let people eat for god sake.\n\nNot good for groups I don't know what the heck previous reviewers are thinking.", 'business_id': 'zUzEjxKEn8eNVksImZ2oGw', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2009-12-06', 'type': 'review'}

The pork belly as David mentions is fantastic.  I also really like the empanadas - flaky and meaty.  I think they make them with short ribs?  YUM.  A few times I\'ve been there the corn tortillas for the tacos were a little thick but overall really delicious.  I\'m a meat lover - and it\'s good here.  The carnitas are flavorful and moist but the chorizo sometimes is too salty.\n\nFriends T and P love the escabeche - the picked veggies and the micheladas -- beer with a kick!  There is one that is nice and spicy - they are on the beer menu not the drink menu.\n\nThe new and improved patio opened the first week of May.  It\'s awesome and at least three times as big as it was before.  It\'s currently near-summer in Pittsburgh which is a great time to go here to sit on the patio.  I went with a ton of friends on the opening weekend of the patio and it was crammed tight with fans but it\'s probably died down a bit since then.  I am armpit height on most normal humans so it was...odoriferous at times.  However everyone was friendly and having a great time.  I ran into more than one friend here (out separately) who texted the next day things like: "so. bright. sun."  and "did I see you last night? or was that a koala?" - oh yeah, the drinks are strong.\n\nThe outside bar was only serving sangria (not bad!) and beer so you had to go inside for anything else or find a harried waitress in the throng.  One really nice touch was that they placed a BIG thermos cooler of ice water with cups on the patio so people could serve themselves - which probably saved me from a killer KILLER hangover.\n\nThe kitchen closes at midnight on Friday and Saturday so don\'t get carried away with your micheladas and forget to put in that last round of tacos!\n\nReally my rating is a 4 in the winter when you have to be a table vulture inside but a 5 in the summer when you can kick back on the patio.

I've never been when it was too busy, so I can't comment on the seating problems...I've always managed to get a table within a few minutes of arriving.\n\nFirst, as a bar, this place is great (4 stars). The scene is relaxed, the outdoor space is plentiful, and the drinks are tasty. No complaints at all.\n\nHowever, as a Mexican restaurant it's boring. The food is bland and unoriginal. The tacos are too thin and so they give you two with each order, which just makes your taco taste like shell and masks the flavor of all the other ingredients. The corn was way over cooked (and over burned) and was rather tasteless. This very well may be the best Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh (though I disagree), that's not saying a whole lot. \n\nPass on this one unless you're just out for drinks (and guacamole...which is actually pretty good).", 'business_id': 'zUzEjxKEn8eNVksImZ2oGw', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2010-08-07', 'type': 'review'}

The first time we tried, it was closed (think it was a Monday). The second time we tried, it was closed... don't remember what day it was - and not the fault of the restaurant really, just unfortunate. The third time we attempted, it was open and packed. We stood in the main waiting area for 15 minutes and not one person approached us... they just ignored us and walked on by. We decided to go across the street instead. We attempted a fourth time, and had the exact same experience as the third time. We decided that we were done with this place.\n\nLast night we were looking for a place to eat dinner, so we decided to give it one more chance. They were open, and had seating near the bar, and on the sidewalk in front of the building; however, you don't get table service out there - they will bring your food, but you have to go inside for everything else. I can deal with that, whatever. We got a few drinks while we were waiting for our food, and not only were they expensive, they were small, and they were not very good. They used a syrup to make it, and you could tell. Very disappointing considering how nice it was outside, and how cool the location is. It'd be a really great place to sit and have several drinks.\n\nSo our food came out. We had the Chorizo tacos and the fish tacos w/ some chips and salsa. The chips and salsa were actually pretty good; however, the tacos were just terrible... and expensive. There was absolutely no flavor in fish tacos, and they were fried. No tasty sauces, and you couldn't even pick out the flavor of the cheese... it was just all very bland. As for the Chorizo tacos, they were a little better only because they had seasoning; however, the meat itself tasted off. We're still debating on if it was actually pork sausage, or fake meat flavored to taste like Chorizo - it said Mexican Pork Sausage on the menu. Needless to say, it was anti-food.\n\nThe worst part of all is that with 4 tacos, chips and salsa and two drinks, and tip the bill was Roughly $40!\n\nMy suggestion is to go to Mexico City for tacos/drinks. They have 2 locations downtown, and I think they just opened one in the South Side. I go there for lunch pretty often. Their tacos taste amazing, and are significantly cheaper and you get complimentary chips and salsa (and least the first round is complimentary). I know the one on Wood St. downtown has a bar, and I imagine the one on the South Side would have to. The locations downtown certainly aren't as cool and the Cantina's location, but if the food, drinks, service and prices suck why does the location even matter?", 'business_id': 'zUzEjxKEn8eNVksImZ2oGw', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2010-08-16', 'type': 'review'}

I went here a lot when I lived in Pittsburgh, and rarely had issues with claims of seat stealing (thrust upon me or by me upon others) but it\'s ridiculous to have to sit and hawk and hover about tables waiting for something to clear up at a place as crowded as this can get.

The booze.\n\nI know what you're thinking - that pseudo-alcoholic from the Midwest is at it again, overlooking what really makes a place great and just going straight for the bottle. But this place is for real. I enjoyed a bloody mary during a Sunday brunch that not only cured a hangover but almost paved the road for the start of a second hangover. My brunch mate slurped down a mojito of sorts that flavorful and strong, much to her delight. Despite the strength of said potions, they were still quite tasty. My only complaint is that I couldn't slog mine down fast enough to enjoy it ice cold in its entirety. I have also enjoyed some sort of spicy martini, another non-spicy martini, and something involving fruit and tequila - while I apologize for not remembering the specifics (see: sentence #1 of this paragraph), I will assure you that everything was enjoyable and strong enough to make a bull lose balance.\n\nThe only complaint I have about this place is that it seems slightly overpriced. I know it is the only decent place of its kind in the area, but their prices signify that they also know it and are using it to their advantage. Also, the vibe can border on the pretentious depending on the crowd, but I would say in general from my visits and peer-ins from the street that the crowd isn't much of a worry. \n\nOverall, and this kind of goes without saying, I'll be back.

I have a special place in my heart for Tacos & Beer in Acapulco.  RCT is up there on my list of favorite taco joints.\n\nRCT serves Mexican-American style tacos.  What that means, is they\'re served Mexico-style, but with an American, upscale twist.  For example...we had pork belly, carne asada, pollo, & pastor.  They\'re serve on two corn tortillas, ~50% larger than Mexico.  Then they\'re blasted with queso, radish slices, & cilantro.  Ranking in order were pork belly (far & away the best), pastor, carne asada, & pollo.  I\'d pass on pollo next time..not bad, but generic.  The pastor is not "authentic" but it\'s still damned good.  I\'ve given up on finding real pastor in the states.  Theirs is tender & soaked in adobo sauce, and absolutely worth getting.*\n\nOn a later visit, I tried a Tijuana Street dog.  These things are like drugs in Mexico (widely available, addictive, & easy to find at 5am.)  It\'s a grilled hot dog wrapped in bacon, covered in avocado, pico, crema, jalapenos, & cheese.  If you think it sounds too intense...you sir, or ma\'am, are not a friend of mine.  It wasn\'t quite the same, but it still brought back memories.  \n\nOh yeah, they have lots of drinks here, too.  :)\n\n*(If you go to Mexico, the one thing you MUST try is real pastor; if it\'s not on a spit, it doesn\'t have a pineapple at the top, and there isn\'t a Mexican guy putting a Japanese guy to shame with his knife skills...move along to the next joint..)', 'business_id': 'zUzEjxKEn8eNVksImZ2oGw', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2011-01-10', 'type': 'review'}

Awesome not smelling like cigarettes.\n\nNow, I saw a complaint about this, but I really prefer my fish in fish tacos battered and deep fried. Which is exactly how Cantina prepared theirs. Maybe this is more a Baja-style fish taco, but whatever. It's also more a Jess-style fish taco. Not only is there a fried fish-delish, the taco portion is huge. It's hard to hold everything together. In fact, that would be my one quibble: there's too much food in the taco. But they are also Mexico City type tacos (Mexico City the city), so they won't generally have a tortilla larger than about 4 inches diameter. There's a lot crammed into those inches though.\n\nThe guacamole was right on. The salsa had a hint of a flavor that I don't love, and I would rather have the chunkier salsa cruda, but it's still good.\n\nI also thought it was very reasonably priced, but my beliefs may have become skewed by Boston.

Their drinks are expensive, the wait staff does not put a lot of effort in making the customer happy (in my experience) and it's tough to grab their attention.  Plus I thought the food is overall about average in my opinion.  I expected more from this place, especially after having read some of the glowing reviews on here.\n\nWent here for the first time about 6 or 7 months ago on a mini bar crawl of sorts and had a round of tequila shots with two friends.  I can't recall the tequila we had but it wasn't particularly tasty.  I think we paid $7 per shot, which was a bit higher than I was anticipating.  We all got kind of a cold vibe from the bartender and later discussed this fact amongst ourselves.  We payed for the shots and bounced within 5 minutes of being there.  About the interior - the indoor bar area was pretty dimly lit (it was around 9 or so from what I recall) and the small bar hangout area had a bunch of hipster-esque folks lingering about amongst themselves in little clusters.\n\nThe next time I went here was about 6 weeks ago with a larger group of friends.  I was really hoping to like this place on the second go-around, which was on a Tuesday evening for happy hour.  Their special is $4 margaritas and $4 sangrias, plus $1 off beers.  The margs were served in a mason jar, which sounds cool, but they are some TINY mason jars.  $4 seems maybe an average price for the serving size you get in my opinion.  And the quality of margarita was nothing particularly special either (I got mine on the rocks).  It just seemed bland, and not particularly strong.  I ordered a set of fish tacos (they were half off I believe?) as well, and they were decent but nothing special.  Nothing like what I remember sampling in coastal Baja California Sur (but then again I'm not sure what RCC is trying to emulate here).  Also got a Tijuana street dog which WAS in fact decent.  I mean it's tough to mess up a hot dog, and add some jalapenos, some avocado, bacon, crema, etc. and you've generally got yourself a party!  The chips were also decent and still warm, though I was not a huge fan of their salsa.  I'm tough to please with Mexican food.  I'll blame it on all those Mexican vacations...\n\nI swear I'm gonna give this place one more shot - third time's a charm, right?  I'll try ordering some different entrees and maybe try some different drinks.  And also try their outdoor seating area.  Until this happens, I'm only giving this place a generous three stars for not living up to the hype to date.

It looks like a restaurant where you would hire Danny Trejo to assassinate somebody.  When you walk in, it's so dark you can only see silhouettes of people at the bar.  For full effect, they should add a record scratching to a stop every time the door opens.  In fact, I've just trademarked that idea.  Once your eyes adjust, this place is actually pretty damn cozy.  You'll enter into the main bar, which has plenty of space.  Most of the mixed drinks are great, but the beer selection is...well, I just hope you like Dos Equis.  The back dining area is pretty comfortable, and they usually play one of those crazy Luchador action hero movies on the screen.  \n\nThe menu is taco based (with a few exceptions) and I am okay with that.  Everything is functionally pretty decent.  There's nothing necessarily that I go home and crave, but I think the overall vibe of the place goes a long way toward correcting this.  In the warmer months, they have a back patio that effectively doubles the size of the restaurant, which is also decorated perfectly to the theme.\n\nThe only drawback is that each time I've been here, the waitstaff seems a bit overwhelmed with the crowds.  Oh, and the cement benches in the back are so low that you will see no less than four hipster ass cracks.  It's alright to throw pennies at them though.

Luckily, we scored the last two stools at the bar!\n\nWe overheard our bartender describing  the making of the housemade bloody Mary mix  to a woman next to us and you know me and bloody Marys!  Naturally, I had to have one.  The b-tender described the mix as more of a gazpacho with lots of cilantro that was made in huge batches and stirred with a paddle.  Good choice there...nice and spicy, kick of cilantro and a heavy hand on the Ketel One.  Nice beginning.  \n\nNot wanting to feel the effects too soon, we ordered the pork belly tacos from the bar menu.  Yet another great choice.  I do love me some pork belly and this one was nicely set off with a kick of heat, smoothed out with a little pineapple and a nice little veggie crunch to boot.  Just a little bit of porky heaven there.\n\nThere are some negatives, though.  Yes, it is called a cantina which to me brings visions of a dingy, dirty south-of-the border establishment.  And that's exactly what we found.  Flies and fruit flies abounded.  The mirror above the bar was encrusted with who-knows-what....shudder.  The bar desperately needed to be wiped down.

The place is a veritable hipster paradise where the drink menu is twice as large as the food menu, everything is served in mason jars, and two tacos cost less than $10. As far as the quality of food, the guacamole is fresh made and out of this world, and my companions liked their tacos well enough. Unfortunately I ordered the enmolidas, chicken enchiladas with mole sauce, and they were basically inedible. I have never in my life had anything so salty.

The salsas that I have tried in the past have been terrible though, so the kitchen is a one trick pony when it comes to vegan options.

I find the situation to be stressful. You usually have to sit down before the servers even clear/clean the table (which makes me feel like an asshole), otherwise you'll lose it.

Once was a year ago and once was on a recent Saturday evening around 6:00pm.  The indoor seating is limited, but the outdoor seating area is one of the best in the Burgh.  \n\nIn 2009, the Round Corner Cantina was converted from the 28-year old Round Corner Hotel.  I never had the chance to visit the Round Corner Hotel, but from what I've heard it was a 28-year old dive bar that mainly catered to Lawrenceville locals.  Converting it to a Mexican bar was obviously a big change.  Although the Round Corner Cantina serves food, the focus is clearly on the drinks.  There's a variety of margaritas, beers, micheladas, and Mexican spirits.  Over the last year or so, the food offerings have decreased.  The only food options currently are chips and tacos.  The tacos have some creative ingredients like pork belly and house-made chorizo.  They're delicious.  On a sunny day, having a margarita and some tasty gourmet tacos at the Round Corner is a solid Yelp 4-star experience.\n\nUnfortunately, I have to take away 2 stars for 2 major problems that I have with the Round Corner Cantina.  The first is that they allow smoking out on their patio.  If it's crowded and there's a lot of people smoking, the secondhand smoke is pretty bad.  What is this, 2000?  There's almost nothing I can stand worse than breathing in other people's cigarette smoke when I'm out in public.  I know the patio is outside, but it's also an enclosed space within the restaurant.  I'm not sure that's legal.  Either way, it's disgusting and really detracts from the nice experience of sitting outside.\n\nMy second criticism is how awfully slow the service is.  We were seated about 25 minutes before a server approached us.  Although there seemed to be a bunch of servers around, it was almost impossible for us to flag anyone down to get more drinks.  Finally, once our sever returned, she only took drink orders from the very end of our 8-person table and ran away before the rest of the table got to order.  Knowing the opportunity to order drinks was a few and far between occurrence, some of our group got up and ordered drinks from the outdoor bar (and returned before our drinks came from our server).\n\nThis kind of thing really shouldn't be happening at a restaurant  that's been open for 3 years.  Don't they want us to spend money at their establishment?  During our most recent visit, the Round Corner Cantina certainly lost out on some income because we couldn't find a server to take our orders.", 'business_id': 'zUzEjxKEn8eNVksImZ2oGw', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2012-05-30', 'type': 'review'}

Few things piss me off more than crap Mexican food that winds up being an insult to the nation and the cuisine. The Round Corner Cantina won me over with their ability to not screw up a good thing. I went there on a Thursday night with a couple of friends (who are my culinary cohorts now that my girlfriend is out of town for the summer) and we were pleased with our selection. The four of us first discovered the RCC when we were placed on a wait for Piccolo Forno, an Italian restaurant of unparalled excellence across the street. As Piccolo is sans bar, we sauntered across the street to RCC for some cocktails while we waited. We were so impressed and pleased we decided to make a return trip. This is the story of that trip.\n\nWhen one walks into the Round Corner, you are immediately transported to a dingy Baja tequila joint. I love the decor inside, it it classic Mexican bar atmosphere. I almost expect Clint Eastwood to stroll through the front door smoking a stogie and wearing a battered old serape. The building is deceptively large; the front bar is small but through an almost hidden hallway, you are led to a larger dining room and then an outdoor patio area. The Patio area looks and feels like a Baja surf bar. I like it, it's relaxed and cool and right up my alley.\n\nIt is easy to tell by the set up of the restaurant and the menu, that Round corner focuses heavily on the bar side of the business. I don't mind this because they do it right. They maintain a large stock of tequilas and mezcals, and here they actually note the difference between the two (no tequila will NEVER have a worm) and their beer selection is populated by mostly Mexican and Carribean lagers. Not the ideal location for a hop head, but on a hot summer night I like those styles, so I was happy with my Red Stripe. Thry also have a coctail menu that is interesting to say the least. Our female friend drank the red sangria and the Something-Star Cocktail and said they were deliscious, but that the sangria was better. For me, I broke up the beer with a Perfect 10, a gin-based play on a mojito. I thought it was quirky and unique, but I switched back to beer (I just don't do fru-fru glassware). One side note, from my prior visit, be careful if you are drinking liquor here. I was ordering single Hendricks' and Tonics and was easily getting doubles and then some.\n\nAs far as the service goes, this is where Round Corner loses as star for me. The service at the bar was quick, effiecient and pleasant, but at the table, things slowed waaaay down. They were busy and I do take that into consideration, but it should not take almost two hours for some chips, tacos, and drinks. Our waitress was nice enough and accomodated all our requests, but she was very slow.\n\nHowever, when the food did come, we forgot all out complaints. We shared orders of the guacamole, slasa verde, and salsa rojo with chips. The chips are hand made there, as were all of the dips. My favorite was the guacamole, but the salsas, while flavorful, were a little runny for my tastes. The runniness also meant that the guys there got salsa all over us. Followed by the chips we got the tacos. I went full-on-fat-boy and got pork belly, hanger steak, and tempura mahi mahi tacos. Coincidentally, that is also the order of my favorites. Starting with the pork belly, if you are not a fan of fat, steer clear. Actually, scratch that, grow a pair, hit the gym later, and get them any way. The pork belly tacos were excellent; succulent and covered in cilantro, onions, and apples. The steak tacos were good as well, but not quite the experience that the pork belly tacos were. The mahi mahi was the biggest dissappointment. The flavor of the fish was just kind of lost amongst the toppings, namely the cabbage. Also, I feel as if the fis tacos provided the least bang for my buck. They are eight dollars, but are really just a couple tortillas, some sauce, and about three ounces of fish. A bit of a rip if you ask me. I usually don't complain about price, but I did feel it was a little pricey here, especially when I can get tacos of a superior quality from Reyna's in the Strip. I guess you could justify it by saying Reyna's tacos are street food and they don't have to pay for the rent and liquor, but I must counter by saying that the ingredients Round Corner uses are very similar to Reyna's and that Round Corner pays for the liquor with the liquor.\n\nAll in all, I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to the Round Corner. The ambiance, quality of food, and bar mean I will be going back at some point, even if I might not be rushing back. I will probably go when I feel like cocktails and decent tacos, but If I am simply on a mission for amazing tacos, Reyna's is still the king in my book.

The pico has a real freshness about it, but that's hardly a unique thing to pull off. \n\nThe part that keeps my review of Round Corner from being a totally positive one is the tacos. The first area where the tacos fail - quite literally - is the corn tortillas. I'm impartial on their use of corn over flour tortillas, but the fact that the they use TWO tortillas for each taco and they STILL fall apart almost immediately when you try to pick up your taco is ridiculous. The flavors in the tacos are fairly pedestrian and almost monotonous, but I can't stand being required to use a fork to eat a taco. On the plus side, they're fairly affordable (2 tacos for about $7), but if taco stand/truck-quality tacos are what you're craving you can still enjoy tastier tacos for less from one of those options.\n\nWill I go back? Sure. My complaints aren't deal breakers, by any means, but Round Corner is hardly my first choice when I'm in a taco/mexican food kind of mood.", 'business_id': 'zUzEjxKEn8eNVksImZ2oGw', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2012-06-19', 'type': 'review'}

I was so shocked at how un-mary like my bloody mary was that after writing this review, I think I\'ll have to block the experience from my mind. \n\nOnto the menu - it\'s changed quite a bit since I frequented it in 2010. The menu changes unfortunately have not been for the better. Their once eclectic selection which featured dishes like a cheesy au-gratin served in a cast-iron skillet, is now a page of run-of-the-mill mexican fare. While the selection is not the worst, it\'s not as good as it used to be and their tacos definitely don\'t come close to the top of my list. \n\nThe tacos: \nTwo soft shell corn tortillas that are soggy and fall apart easily. I had the seitan tacos, which I\'d recommend as a decent veg option. \n\nOn the plus side, their guacamole is top-notch and they have a bomb patio. I highly recommend their chips, guac, and margaritas or sangria if you\'re looking to kick it with friends.

The Sunday Brunch is worth 4 stars: $4 Bloody Marys or Bloody Marias.  Both well-mixed and priced right.  Not too crowded.\n\nThe catch is that this place is intolerable on weekends.  Being that Butler St. only has a dozen bars, this should be a top choice for me.  But it's not.  The service is incredibly slow.  Worst than that, the server knew nothing about the drinks.  I tried to ask about the Carnation, but she had to look at the menu to see which drink I was referring to.  I ordered it anyway.  What looked to be a mix of the best attributes of my two favorite cocktails--the Cosmo and the Dark 'N Stormy--was just a heavy dose of ginger beer with a splash of mediocre vodka, a touch of cran juice, far too much lime, and way too much ice.  It was a hot night and the drink was thoroughly watered down by the time it got to me.  I'd be inclined to blame the server over the bartender, but I'm not sure.  I'm not a professional bartender, but when I serve drinks with ice on days over 80 degrees, I make specialty ice cubes with the drink ingredients to not water down the drink.  For $7, I certainly wasn't expecting my cocktail to be a third water by the time it arrived.\n\nFinally, the food.  In a word: eh.  I thought both of the pork tacos were all right.  But the pollo tinga was downright awful.  Chicken in all varieties is one of my food staples, but something unholy was done to this poultry.  The guac was decent, but honestly Mad Mex has better...and if you're claiming to be authentic Mexican anything, Mad Mex should not best you on any detail.  To top it off, they charge $3.5 for chips and salsa and then only refill the chips but not the salsa.

Radishes, housemade salsas, cilantro, and all of the other ingredients you'd actually find in authentic Mexican-style tacos.

Guess we will see!\nI love tacos, so obviously a place that serves nothing but tacos, and tacos done right, is very appealing to me. The outside of the building is really cute, quintessential Lawrenceville, and it literally has a rounded corner. Thanks, Captain Obvious! From the outside of this brick building, you'd never guess they had quite the substantial outdoor courtyard that they do, but on a warm day it's an ideal place to sit and enjoy one of those margaritas. The La Cantina margarita is outstanding, there doesn't seem to be a reason to order anything else (although there are many spirit options!),  and there's just something comforting about drinking tequila from a mason jar. Maybe it's me. \nThe guacamole is really fantastic and fresh, and you get a huge portion of it for $5. The chips are a bit on the greasy side, but it's obvious they are made fresh daily, and usually by this point I'm down half a margarita at least and don't care quite as much. The chunky pico de gallo is really quite good as well. \nThere are two vegetarian options on the taco menu, the tacos de seitan and the tacos de rajas con papas. The latter have poblano peppers, cooked potatoes, corn, the fantastic chihuahua cheese, cilantro, and RADISHES. I can't stress how much I enjoy radishes on my tacos. I had no idea I was missing this from my life/taco repertoire until I visited Round Corner Cantina. The seitan tacos also have radishes(!), a refreshing avocado salsa, stewed onions, and the seitan is prepared in this spicy-ish sauce that I could put on my cereal. I've never had seitan prepared so expertly. Even if you aren't a vegetarian, you owe it to yourself to try these tasty little numbers.\nThe service has always been decent, kind of slow, but not terrible. Also, if you had never been here before, you'd walk in and just think this place was a small bar. You have to walk past the bar and around a corner to find the dining room and patio, it looks like you are heading to the bathroom, it isn't obvious. The plate size that the tacos come on I also find to be a bit curious, as it is barely big enough for the two tacos that come with your order, which makes things a bit messy.

Kept hearing about in via word of mouth, so grabbed the 86B and strolled down the hill. \n\nGiven neighborhood, I initially confused the place, for someone having a lively houseparty. An old head-high fence and hanging lamps with their illumination filtering through the wood beams.\n\nThe crowd is not what I call a traditional "hipster" crowd that you may encounter  a la Brillobox. More "mature" if that has any meaning nowadays. The front bar area was small, but never gave off the impression of sardine packed-in-ed-ness. What appealed to me the most is the general sociability of the place. They talk to strangers here, and while that may be tied to the people than the place, per se, it adds to it, imho.\n\nAll waitresses/servers are *amazingly* hot and friendly. Grabbed a seat. Drank two caipirinhas and a hopdevil. Packed full of kick. Mason jars, are strange to drink out of, unless you are from the south or Missouri.  I have no such problem, and it gives off a very down-to-earth air that I would expect out of Lawrenceville. Costs seem to be "midling." 6-7 bucks for some of the drinks. That is not huge to me, but may be to others.\n\nMenu looked tasty, and had some Spanish and Mexican beers I ran into during my foreign travels.  Did not sample food menu, but will in the future. \n\nA great jukebox, and given the sensitivity of my ears, the volume was not too too bad...for a while. Later on that night, not sure if they cut it higher or if certain albums play louder than others. It seemed less of a problem than other places in terms of sheer "blast."\n\nThere appears to be a secondary room of tables and chairs behind the front bar area, and going further to the rear of the establishment and up the hill is an intriguing grassy patio area. Did not explore that, because I\'m a friendless wuss who is afraid of looking like a loser, but if you come with 5+ folk, you may want to snag a spot out there early and see what stars you may be able in amongst all the air pollution.\n\nThis is close to a 5, but I only gave 4 due to the slowness of getting served at times. It seems like there is no bar to serve clients on the rear-patio area; the two ladies in the front were very busy cranking out drinks for all, so I could not fault them for the time it took. The time was due to the crush, versus indicative of any rudeness or lack of attentiveness. If they could resolve that, or add more barstaff, I think it would tip it over into perfection.\n\nThis place has character, good service, good people, and thankfully is a work in progress.', 'business_id': 'zUzEjxKEn8eNVksImZ2oGw', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2009-10-09', 'type': 'review'}

I also made a suggestion to a woman with short hair next to me (seemed to be doing managerial things) that they should post their kitchen hours on their site since they differ from their operating hours.  She asked me "WHY?" in a snotty tone and I explained that since they don\'t answer their phone (their voicemail tells you to email them!?!) I was not sure if I would be able to eat.  I don\'t drink alcohol and my primary concern on Monday nights is checking out new restaurants.  Had I come down and their kitchen was not open I would be giving RCC even less stars.  She told me she would add it to their site in a still crappy tone.

It simply was slammed.  Front bar was full and surrounding handful of tables.  The back room, which has around 10 tables was also full.  There is no list and much less reservations.  This was very frustrating, jockeying for position to take a table when it opened up only to have the one person in front of you suddenly have their 8 friends show up and take all of the open tables.  We ended up waiting an hour for a table for four.\n\nNot much of a scene, it really didn't seem like a lawrenceville crowd at all... definitely mostly people from Shadyside or the burbs driving their BMWs down to the new hip spot.\n\nI must say though, once the food came, all my angst regarding seating and pretentious other customers melted away.  We started with guacomole and salsa, both of which were simply superb.  The guac was simple, but creamy and satisfying.  The salsa was full of roasted poblano goodness.\n\nThe menu is around 15 items from $5-$12.  The bulk of it are corn-tortilla tacos with various other offerings.\n\nThen my tacos came.  Good lord, I am so glad I ordered the pork belly.  Each taco had a healthy serving of pork belly covered in a spicy roasted, smoky sauce, onions, celantro, apple, radish and queso fresco.  I really wish I could eat these everyday.  At $8, the price was right for a sit down restaurant, but I do wish I could find these for lunch somewhere for $6.\n\nSo, all in all, the food and service was excellent.  The scene and having to jockey for a table for an hour really left me grumpy and will make me think twice about going again.\n\nLsatly, to the table of 3 who had finished their food when we got there, and were still at their table 2 hours later when we left.  If anyone from that group is reading this, what a low-life sitting there watching others wait for a table while you sip your drink and laugh about the wallpaper and run your hands through your stupid balding head of curly hair.  Go get a drink somewhere else and let people eat for god sake.\n\nNot good for groups I don't know what the heck previous reviewers are thinking.", 'business_id': 'zUzEjxKEn8eNVksImZ2oGw', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2009-12-06', 'type': 'review'}

Autentico!\n\nI\'m a SoCal native and have been seeking decent tacos for SO long in the Burgh and of course they arrive as I am departing (shakes fist at sky in taco frustration!).  The pork belly as David mentions is fantastic.  I also really like the empanadas - flaky and meaty.  I think they make them with short ribs?  YUM.  A few times I\'ve been there the corn tortillas for the tacos were a little thick but overall really delicious.  I\'m a meat lover - and it\'s good here.  The carnitas are flavorful and moist but the chorizo sometimes is too salty.\n\nFriends T and P love the escabeche - the picked veggies and the micheladas -- beer with a kick!  There is one that is nice and spicy - they are on the beer menu not the drink menu.\n\nThe new and improved patio opened the first week of May.  It\'s awesome and at least three times as big as it was before.  It\'s currently near-summer in Pittsburgh which is a great time to go here to sit on the patio.  I went with a ton of friends on the opening weekend of the patio and it was crammed tight with fans but it\'s probably died down a bit since then.  I am armpit height on most normal humans so it was...odoriferous at times.  However everyone was friendly and having a great time.  I ran into more than one friend here (out separately) who texted the next day things like: "so. bright. sun."  and "did I see you last night? or was that a koala?" - oh yeah, the drinks are strong.\n\nThe outside bar was only serving sangria (not bad!) and beer so you had to go inside for anything else or find a harried waitress in the throng.  One really nice touch was that they placed a BIG thermos cooler of ice water with cups on the patio so people could serve themselves - which probably saved me from a killer KILLER hangover.\n\nThe kitchen closes at midnight on Friday and Saturday so don\'t get carried away with your micheladas and forget to put in that last round of tacos!\n\nReally my rating is a 4 in the winter when you have to be a table vulture inside but a 5 in the summer when you can kick back on the patio.

The first time we tried, it was closed (think it was a Monday). The second time we tried, it was closed... don't remember what day it was - and not the fault of the restaurant really, just unfortunate. The third time we attempted, it was open and packed. We stood in the main waiting area for 15 minutes and not one person approached us... they just ignored us and walked on by. We decided to go across the street instead. We attempted a fourth time, and had the exact same experience as the third time. We decided that we were done with this place.\n\nLast night we were looking for a place to eat dinner, so we decided to give it one more chance. They were open, and had seating near the bar, and on the sidewalk in front of the building; however, you don't get table service out there - they will bring your food, but you have to go inside for everything else. I can deal with that, whatever. We got a few drinks while we were waiting for our food, and not only were they expensive, they were small, and they were not very good. They used a syrup to make it, and you could tell. Very disappointing considering how nice it was outside, and how cool the location is. It'd be a really great place to sit and have several drinks.\n\nSo our food came out. We had the Chorizo tacos and the fish tacos w/ some chips and salsa. The chips and salsa were actually pretty good; however, the tacos were just terrible... and expensive. There was absolutely no flavor in fish tacos, and they were fried. No tasty sauces, and you couldn't even pick out the flavor of the cheese... it was just all very bland. As for the Chorizo tacos, they were a little better only because they had seasoning; however, the meat itself tasted off. We're still debating on if it was actually pork sausage, or fake meat flavored to taste like Chorizo - it said Mexican Pork Sausage on the menu. Needless to say, it was anti-food.\n\nThe worst part of all is that with 4 tacos, chips and salsa and two drinks, and tip the bill was Roughly $40!\n\nMy suggestion is to go to Mexico City for tacos/drinks. They have 2 locations downtown, and I think they just opened one in the South Side. I go there for lunch pretty often. Their tacos taste amazing, and are significantly cheaper and you get complimentary chips and salsa (and least the first round is complimentary). I know the one on Wood St. downtown has a bar, and I imagine the one on the South Side would have to. The locations downtown certainly aren't as cool and the Cantina's location, but if the food, drinks, service and prices suck why does the location even matter?", 'business_id': 'zUzEjxKEn8eNVksImZ2oGw', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2010-08-16', 'type': 'review'}

Absolutely, the seitan tacos are a great substitution to a carnivore diet (this coming from a near meatatarian). Undoubtedly, their combination of brunch and mexican cuisines is tasty and filling. Remarkably, their salsas/sauces/guac are all fresh, delicious, and worth licking the bowl for the last bits.\n\nBut the real reason I'll go back? The booze.\n\nI know what you're thinking - that pseudo-alcoholic from the Midwest is at it again, overlooking what really makes a place great and just going straight for the bottle. But this place is for real. I enjoyed a bloody mary during a Sunday brunch that not only cured a hangover but almost paved the road for the start of a second hangover. My brunch mate slurped down a mojito of sorts that flavorful and strong, much to her delight. Despite the strength of said potions, they were still quite tasty. My only complaint is that I couldn't slog mine down fast enough to enjoy it ice cold in its entirety. I have also enjoyed some sort of spicy martini, another non-spicy martini, and something involving fruit and tequila - while I apologize for not remembering the specifics (see: sentence #1 of this paragraph), I will assure you that everything was enjoyable and strong enough to make a bull lose balance.\n\nThe only complaint I have about this place is that it seems slightly overpriced. I know it is the only decent place of its kind in the area, but their prices signify that they also know it and are using it to their advantage. Also, the vibe can border on the pretentious depending on the crowd, but I would say in general from my visits and peer-ins from the street that the crowd isn't much of a worry. \n\nOverall, and this kind of goes without saying, I'll be back. What can I say - some of us love the sauce, whichever variety it may be.", 'business_id': 'zUzEjxKEn8eNVksImZ2oGw', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2010-12-28', 'type': 'review'}

I have a special place in my heart for Tacos & Beer in Acapulco.  RCT is up there on my list of favorite taco joints.\n\nRCT serves Mexican-American style tacos.  What that means, is they\'re served Mexico-style, but with an American, upscale twist.  For example...we had pork belly, carne asada, pollo, & pastor.  They\'re serve on two corn tortillas, ~50% larger than Mexico.  Then they\'re blasted with queso, radish slices, & cilantro.  Ranking in order were pork belly (far & away the best), pastor, carne asada, & pollo.  I\'d pass on pollo next time..not bad, but generic.  The pastor is not "authentic" but it\'s still damned good.  I\'ve given up on finding real pastor in the states.  Theirs is tender & soaked in adobo sauce, and absolutely worth getting.*\n\nOn a later visit, I tried a Tijuana Street dog.  These things are like drugs in Mexico (widely available, addictive, & easy to find at 5am.)  It\'s a grilled hot dog wrapped in bacon, covered in avocado, pico, crema, jalapenos, & cheese.  If you think it sounds too intense...you sir, or ma\'am, are not a friend of mine.  It wasn\'t quite the same, but it still brought back memories.  \n\nOh yeah, they have lots of drinks here, too.  :)\n\n*(If you go to Mexico, the one thing you MUST try is real pastor; if it\'s not on a spit, it doesn\'t have a pineapple at the top, and there isn\'t a Mexican guy putting a Japanese guy to shame with his knife skills...move along to the next joint..)', 'business_id': 'zUzEjxKEn8eNVksImZ2oGw', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2011-01-10', 'type': 'review'}

Awesome not smelling like cigarettes.\n\nNow, I saw a complaint about this, but I really prefer my fish in fish tacos battered and deep fried. Which is exactly how Cantina prepared theirs. Maybe this is more a Baja-style fish taco, but whatever. It's also more a Jess-style fish taco. Not only is there a fried fish-delish, the taco portion is huge. It's hard to hold everything together. In fact, that would be my one quibble: there's too much food in the taco. But they are also Mexico City type tacos (Mexico City the city), so they won't generally have a tortilla larger than about 4 inches diameter. There's a lot crammed into those inches though.\n\nThe guacamole was right on. The salsa had a hint of a flavor that I don't love, and I would rather have the chunkier salsa cruda, but it's still good.\n\nI also thought it was very reasonably priced, but my beliefs may have become skewed by Boston.

Plus I thought the food is overall about average in my opinion.  I expected more from this place, especially after having read some of the glowing reviews on here.\n\nWent here for the first time about 6 or 7 months ago on a mini bar crawl of sorts and had a round of tequila shots with two friends.  I can't recall the tequila we had but it wasn't particularly tasty.  I think we paid $7 per shot, which was a bit higher than I was anticipating.  We all got kind of a cold vibe from the bartender and later discussed this fact amongst ourselves.  We payed for the shots and bounced within 5 minutes of being there.  About the interior - the indoor bar area was pretty dimly lit (it was around 9 or so from what I recall) and the small bar hangout area had a bunch of hipster-esque folks lingering about amongst themselves in little clusters.\n\nThe next time I went here was about 6 weeks ago with a larger group of friends.  I was really hoping to like this place on the second go-around, which was on a Tuesday evening for happy hour.  Their special is $4 margaritas and $4 sangrias, plus $1 off beers.  The margs were served in a mason jar, which sounds cool, but they are some TINY mason jars.  $4 seems maybe an average price for the serving size you get in my opinion.  And the quality of margarita was nothing particularly special either (I got mine on the rocks).  It just seemed bland, and not particularly strong.  I ordered a set of fish tacos (they were half off I believe?) as well, and they were decent but nothing special.  Nothing like what I remember sampling in coastal Baja California Sur (but then again I'm not sure what RCC is trying to emulate here).  Also got a Tijuana street dog which WAS in fact decent.  I mean it's tough to mess up a hot dog, and add some jalapenos, some avocado, bacon, crema, etc. and you've generally got yourself a party!  The chips were also decent and still warm, though I was not a huge fan of their salsa.  I'm tough to please with Mexican food.  I'll blame it on all those Mexican vacations...\n\nI swear I'm gonna give this place one more shot - third time's a charm, right?  I'll try ordering some different entrees and maybe try some different drinks.  And also try their outdoor seating area.

It looks like a restaurant where you would hire Danny Trejo to assassinate somebody.  When you walk in, it's so dark you can only see silhouettes of people at the bar.  For full effect, they should add a record scratching to a stop every time the door opens.  In fact, I've just trademarked that idea.  Once your eyes adjust, this place is actually pretty damn cozy.  You'll enter into the main bar, which has plenty of space.  Most of the mixed drinks are great, but the beer selection is...well, I just hope you like Dos Equis.  The back dining area is pretty comfortable, and they usually play one of those crazy Luchador action hero movies on the screen.  \n\nThe menu is taco based (with a few exceptions) and I am okay with that.  Everything is functionally pretty decent.  There's nothing necessarily that I go home and crave, but I think the overall vibe of the place goes a long way toward correcting this.  In the warmer months, they have a back patio that effectively doubles the size of the restaurant, which is also decorated perfectly to the theme.\n\nThe only drawback is that each time I've been here, the waitstaff seems a bit overwhelmed with the crowds.  Oh, and the cement benches in the back are so low that you will see no less than four hipster ass cracks.  It's alright to throw pennies at them though.  Legend tells that if you land a penny betwixt those scrawny cheeks, you win 1,000 free tacos.\n\nI might have made some of that up though.", 'business_id': 'zUzEjxKEn8eNVksImZ2oGw', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2011-06-28', 'type': 'review'}

We headed straight for the patio, but it was PACKED, too.  We turned up our noses at the odd room in the middle that is dark and dominated by a large screen and EMPTY.  Luckily, we scored the last two stools at the bar!\n\nWe overheard our bartender describing  the making of the housemade bloody Mary mix  to a woman next to us and you know me and bloody Marys!  Naturally, I had to have one.  The b-tender described the mix as more of a gazpacho with lots of cilantro that was made in huge batches and stirred with a paddle.  Good choice there...nice and spicy, kick of cilantro and a heavy hand on the Ketel One.  Nice beginning.  \n\nNot wanting to feel the effects too soon, we ordered the pork belly tacos from the bar menu.  Yet another great choice.  I do love me some pork belly and this one was nicely set off with a kick of heat, smoothed out with a little pineapple and a nice little veggie crunch to boot.  Just a little bit of porky heaven there.\n\nThere are some negatives, though.  Yes, it is called a cantina which to me brings visions of a dingy, dirty south-of-the border establishment.  And that's exactly what we found.  Flies and fruit flies abounded.  The mirror above the bar was encrusted with who-knows-what....shudder.  The bar desperately needed to be wiped down.  The other negative was the prices!  \n\nI'll close out with another positive.  The bartenders were efficient, friendly and very skilled.  Worth another try just for the drinks and the pork belly!", 'business_id': 'zUzEjxKEn8eNVksImZ2oGw', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2011-07-03', 'type': 'review'}

The space is something of a maze, with tiny room upon tiny room separated by tiny staircases and finally culminating in a large outdoor patio. (Think the Seinfeld episode where Kramer built the levels in his apartment.) The decor doesn't seem to have changed since the hotel's heyday, but in a good way, with ancient floral wallpaper and creaky wood floors creating a romantic, mysterious atmosphere.\n\nOutside the ambiance is more cantina and less film noir, which is appropriate enough, Round Corner being a Mexican restaurant and all. The place is a veritable hipster paradise where the drink menu is twice as large as the food menu, everything is served in mason jars, and two tacos cost less than $10. As far as the quality of food, the guacamole is fresh made and out of this world, and my companions liked their tacos well enough. Unfortunately I ordered the enmolidas, chicken enchiladas with mole sauce, and they were basically inedible. I have never in my life had anything so salty. It was bizarre and truly disgusting, and so disappointing, since everything else about Round Corner is great. Let this serve as a cautionary tale: go to Round Corner Cantina, get some guacamole and a margarita, DO NOT under any circumstances order the enmoladas!", 'business_id': 'zUzEjxKEn8eNVksImZ2oGw', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2011-07-06', 'type': 'review'}

Ample cilantro and lime make them super tasty and radish adds nice color and crunch. I love the double tortilla method which keeps the experience pretty neat-- I usually avoid tacos because they get messy, but these are manageable. The salsas that I have tried in the past have been terrible though, so the kitchen is a one trick pony when it comes to vegan options. The bartenders make great Pimms' cups (with cucumber!) and I really like the Carnation cocktail. The atmosphere of the bar is cool, the music is usually interesting and the back patio is to die for. Seriously, getting a table on the patio can be cut-throat, as seating is first come first serve (or a competition of attention and aggression) and is not managed by staff. I find the situation to be stressful. You usually have to sit down before the servers even clear/clean the table (which makes me feel like an asshole), otherwise you'll lose it. It's kind of like a showdown in the wild west, sometimes resulting in a draw (two parties claim a table at the same time and a new sort of standoff begins). I think I could muster up a fourth star should they get a host to keep seating organized and clean on busy nights.

Definitely another one of those places in Pittsburgh that makes me feel like I\'m in the East Village or Williamsburg or somewhere else in downtown Manhattan or in Brooklyn. The outdoor patio (I\'d call it a beer garden) is fantastic and for me is the big drawcard for this place. \n\nThe food we tried was very tasty (we enjoyed some tacos and a quesadilla). Some other reviewers have been less positive about the food but I can honestly say that the tacos were some of the tastiest I\'ve eaten outside of Mexico. \n\nThe drinks are another story altogether. Perhaps we were unlucky, but the two margaritas we each ordered were just not hitting the mark--they apparently used good tequila but things were a bit "rough" to me. Definitely way better than a sugary "margarita" you\'d get at a cheesy American Tex-Mex place, but not perfect. In future I\'m going to stick to beer. Which is fine, because knocking back some cold beers and tasty tacos in the festively lit outdoor patio on a warm evening is exactly what this place is for.\n\n(Final note: yes this place seems to attract the growing group of Pittsburgh hipsters, or "Pittsters" as I prefer to call them.

Once was a year ago and once was on a recent Saturday evening around 6:00pm.  The indoor seating is limited, but the outdoor seating area is one of the best in the Burgh.  \n\nIn 2009, the Round Corner Cantina was converted from the 28-year old Round Corner Hotel.  I never had the chance to visit the Round Corner Hotel, but from what I've heard it was a 28-year old dive bar that mainly catered to Lawrenceville locals.  Converting it to a Mexican bar was obviously a big change.  Although the Round Corner Cantina serves food, the focus is clearly on the drinks.  There's a variety of margaritas, beers, micheladas, and Mexican spirits.  Over the last year or so, the food offerings have decreased.  The only food options currently are chips and tacos.  The tacos have some creative ingredients like pork belly and house-made chorizo.  They're delicious.  On a sunny day, having a margarita and some tasty gourmet tacos at the Round Corner is a solid Yelp 4-star experience.\n\nUnfortunately, I have to take away 2 stars for 2 major problems that I have with the Round Corner Cantina.  The first is that they allow smoking out on their patio.  If it's crowded and there's a lot of people smoking, the secondhand smoke is pretty bad.  What is this, 2000?  There's almost nothing I can stand worse than breathing in other people's cigarette smoke when I'm out in public.  I know the patio is outside, but it's also an enclosed space within the restaurant.  I'm not sure that's legal.  Either way, it's disgusting and really detracts from the nice experience of sitting outside.\n\nMy second criticism is how awfully slow the service is.  We were seated about 25 minutes before a server approached us.  Although there seemed to be a bunch of servers around, it was almost impossible for us to flag anyone down to get more drinks.  Finally, once our sever returned, she only took drink orders from the very end of our 8-person table and ran away before the rest of the table got to order.  Knowing the opportunity to order drinks was a few and far between occurrence, some of our group got up and ordered drinks from the outdoor bar (and returned before our drinks came from our server).\n\nThis kind of thing really shouldn't be happening at a restaurant  that's been open for 3 years.  Don't they want us to spend money at their establishment?  During our most recent visit, the Round Corner Cantina certainly lost out on some income because we couldn't find a server to take our orders.", 'business_id': 'zUzEjxKEn8eNVksImZ2oGw', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2012-05-30', 'type': 'review'}

Few things piss me off more than crap Mexican food that winds up being an insult to the nation and the cuisine. The Round Corner Cantina won me over with their ability to not screw up a good thing. I went there on a Thursday night with a couple of friends (who are my culinary cohorts now that my girlfriend is out of town for the summer) and we were pleased with our selection. The four of us first discovered the RCC when we were placed on a wait for Piccolo Forno, an Italian restaurant of unparalled excellence across the street. As Piccolo is sans bar, we sauntered across the street to RCC for some cocktails while we waited. We were so impressed and pleased we decided to make a return trip. This is the story of that trip.\n\nWhen one walks into the Round Corner, you are immediately transported to a dingy Baja tequila joint. I love the decor inside, it it classic Mexican bar atmosphere. I almost expect Clint Eastwood to stroll through the front door smoking a stogie and wearing a battered old serape. The building is deceptively large; the front bar is small but through an almost hidden hallway, you are led to a larger dining room and then an outdoor patio area. The Patio area looks and feels like a Baja surf bar. I like it, it's relaxed and cool and right up my alley.\n\nIt is easy to tell by the set up of the restaurant and the menu, that Round corner focuses heavily on the bar side of the business. I don't mind this because they do it right. They maintain a large stock of tequilas and mezcals, and here they actually note the difference between the two (no tequila will NEVER have a worm) and their beer selection is populated by mostly Mexican and Carribean lagers. Not the ideal location for a hop head, but on a hot summer night I like those styles, so I was happy with my Red Stripe. Thry also have a coctail menu that is interesting to say the least. Our female friend drank the red sangria and the Something-Star Cocktail and said they were deliscious, but that the sangria was better. For me, I broke up the beer with a Perfect 10, a gin-based play on a mojito. I thought it was quirky and unique, but I switched back to beer (I just don't do fru-fru glassware). One side note, from my prior visit, be careful if you are drinking liquor here. I was ordering single Hendricks' and Tonics and was easily getting doubles and then some.\n\nAs far as the service goes, this is where Round Corner loses as star for me. The service at the bar was quick, effiecient and pleasant, but at the table, things slowed waaaay down. They were busy and I do take that into consideration, but it should not take almost two hours for some chips, tacos, and drinks. Our waitress was nice enough and accomodated all our requests, but she was very slow.\n\nHowever, when the food did come, we forgot all out complaints. We shared orders of the guacamole, slasa verde, and salsa rojo with chips. The chips are hand made there, as were all of the dips. My favorite was the guacamole, but the salsas, while flavorful, were a little runny for my tastes. The runniness also meant that the guys there got salsa all over us. Followed by the chips we got the tacos. I went full-on-fat-boy and got pork belly, hanger steak, and tempura mahi mahi tacos. Coincidentally, that is also the order of my favorites. Starting with the pork belly, if you are not a fan of fat, steer clear. Actually, scratch that, grow a pair, hit the gym later, and get them any way. The pork belly tacos were excellent; succulent and covered in cilantro, onions, and apples. The steak tacos were good as well, but not quite the experience that the pork belly tacos were. The mahi mahi was the biggest dissappointment. The flavor of the fish was just kind of lost amongst the toppings, namely the cabbage. Also, I feel as if the fis tacos provided the least bang for my buck. They are eight dollars, but are really just a couple tortillas, some sauce, and about three ounces of fish. A bit of a rip if you ask me. I usually don't complain about price, but I did feel it was a little pricey here, especially when I can get tacos of a superior quality from Reyna's in the Strip. I guess you could justify it by saying Reyna's tacos are street food and they don't have to pay for the rent and liquor, but I must counter by saying that the ingredients Round Corner uses are very similar to Reyna's and that Round Corner pays for the liquor with the liquor.\n\nAll in all, I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to the Round Corner. The ambiance, quality of food, and bar mean I will be going back at some point, even if I might not be rushing back. I will probably go when I feel like cocktails and decent tacos, but If I am simply on a mission for amazing tacos, Reyna's is still the king in my book.

Plus, the owner is a nice guy. Unfortunately, the food just doesn't do it for me, and that's the most important aspect.\n\nOf all of the things that I've tried in the handful of times that I've eaten there, I'd say the tamales are the best thing on the menu. They're truly delicious, and the sole thing that I think about when Round Corner is mentioned. The pico and chips are also good. The pico has a real freshness about it, but that's hardly a unique thing to pull off. \n\nThe part that keeps my review of Round Corner from being a totally positive one is the tacos. The first area where the tacos fail - quite literally - is the corn tortillas. I'm impartial on their use of corn over flour tortillas, but the fact that the they use TWO tortillas for each taco and they STILL fall apart almost immediately when you try to pick up your taco is ridiculous. The flavors in the tacos are fairly pedestrian and almost monotonous, but I can't stand being required to use a fork to eat a taco. On the plus side, they're fairly affordable (2 tacos for about $7), but if taco stand/truck-quality tacos are what you're craving you can still enjoy tastier tacos for less from one of those options.\n\nWill I go back? Sure.

Being that Butler St. only has a dozen bars, this should be a top choice for me.  But it's not.  The service is incredibly slow.  Worst than that, the server knew nothing about the drinks.  I tried to ask about the Carnation, but she had to look at the menu to see which drink I was referring to.  I ordered it anyway.  What looked to be a mix of the best attributes of my two favorite cocktails--the Cosmo and the Dark 'N Stormy--was just a heavy dose of ginger beer with a splash of mediocre vodka, a touch of cran juice, far too much lime, and way too much ice.  It was a hot night and the drink was thoroughly watered down by the time it got to me.  I'd be inclined to blame the server over the bartender, but I'm not sure.  I'm not a professional bartender, but when I serve drinks with ice on days over 80 degrees, I make specialty ice cubes with the drink ingredients to not water down the drink.  For $7, I certainly wasn't expecting my cocktail to be a third water by the time it arrived.\n\nFinally, the food.  In a word: eh.  I thought both of the pork tacos were all right.  But the pollo tinga was downright awful.  Chicken in all varieties is one of my food staples, but something unholy was done to this poultry.  The guac was decent, but honestly Mad Mex has better...and if you're claiming to be authentic Mexican anything, Mad Mex should not best you on any detail.

You get a Mason jar full of pickled vegetables (and sometimes some fruit) for about 4 bucks and it is always full of flavor, fun to eat, and a total crowd pleaser.\n\nThe patio is also pretty rad and has been packed with people every time I go.\n\nI am giving four stars because I have a great experience every time I go to Round Corner and I recommend it to anyone.', 'business_id': 'zUzEjxKEn8eNVksImZ2oGw', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2012-07-18', 'type': 'review'}

The first thing that won me over was the authenticity of their tacos. No lettuce, shredded cheddar cheese, ground beef, or other Americanized fillings here. Radishes, housemade salsas, cilantro, and all of the other ingredients you'd actually find in authentic Mexican-style tacos. And boy, are they good!\n\nI have tried the tacos de carne (hanger steak) and the tacos de puerco (pork belly). They were both great, but the puerco was definitely the better of the two. The apple salsa and the poblano made it just spot-on delicious! I've also tried the chips with salsa and their guacamole. I would recommend the guac over the salsa. The salsa wasn't bad, but it was sort of average. The guac was nice and creamy with bits of cilantro (I love cilantro).\n\nOn to the alcohol: the selection is small and Mexican, which is fine with me because I love my Tecate and Dos Equis Amber (small and Mexican - NO PUN INTENDED hehe). \n\nOne of the things I love about this place is the price is right. Two tacos, a 24-ounce Tecate, and chips & guacamole would run you about $18 - not bad at all.", 'business_id': 'zUzEjxKEn8eNVksImZ2oGw', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2012-08-07', 'type': 'review'}

Guess we will see!\nI love tacos, so obviously a place that serves nothing but tacos, and tacos done right, is very appealing to me. The outside of the building is really cute, quintessential Lawrenceville, and it literally has a rounded corner. Thanks, Captain Obvious! From the outside of this brick building, you'd never guess they had quite the substantial outdoor courtyard that they do, but on a warm day it's an ideal place to sit and enjoy one of those margaritas. The La Cantina margarita is outstanding, there doesn't seem to be a reason to order anything else (although there are many spirit options!),  and there's just something comforting about drinking tequila from a mason jar. Maybe it's me. \nThe guacamole is really fantastic and fresh, and you get a huge portion of it for $5. The chips are a bit on the greasy side, but it's obvious they are made fresh daily, and usually by this point I'm down half a margarita at least and don't care quite as much. The chunky pico de gallo is really quite good as well. \nThere are two vegetarian options on the taco menu, the tacos de seitan and the tacos de rajas con papas. The latter have poblano peppers, cooked potatoes, corn, the fantastic chihuahua cheese, cilantro, and RADISHES. I can't stress how much I enjoy radishes on my tacos. I had no idea I was missing this from my life/taco repertoire until I visited Round Corner Cantina. The seitan tacos also have radishes(!), a refreshing avocado salsa, stewed onions, and the seitan is prepared in this spicy-ish sauce that I could put on my cereal. I've never had seitan prepared so expertly. Even if you aren't a vegetarian, you owe it to yourself to try these tasty little numbers.\nThe service has always been decent, kind of slow, but not terrible. Also, if you had never been here before, you'd walk in and just think this place was a small bar. You have to walk past the bar and around a corner to find the dining room and patio, it looks like you are heading to the bathroom, it isn't obvious. The plate size that the tacos come on I also find to be a bit curious, as it is barely big enough for the two tacos that come with your order, which makes things a bit messy. But maybe that's just me. None of these things could ever stop me from craving that seitan taco.

They really shortened their menu quite a bit and got rid of the tamales which were my favorite :(  Also the chips and salsa were no longer complimentary and they charged me double when I asked for a refill on the salsa when we had extra chips! And the guac was not as flavorful as I remembered it.  The meatballs I ordered were supposed to come with some kind of queso but that was no where to be seen and my order came out 15 min after my friend's order.  And these $8 meatballs were basically 3 meatballs on a skillet with no sides or anything with it.  And the drink prices were really reasonable when I came before during happy hour when I had a $4 sangria, but at the almost $7 paid at their regular price when the sangria is super tiny with tons of ice and very weak (although tasty) it just wasn't worth it.  Also their beer list seems to have decreased.  The server was attentive despite the orders coming out very far apart so I don't think that was her fault.

And what better of a time to go than happy hour on a Friday?  Drink specials and free chips and salsa!  The pitcher of margaritas is a great buy during this time compared to the price per glass.  \n\nLet me go back to the beginning.  When we walked in we were greeted by the doorman who promptly asked for ID (thank you, I feel young again!).  The door did state that NO ONE under the age of 21 is allowed entry.  The lighting was dim, the room cozy with a sign pointing to the patio (watch the steps), and the aroma upon entry was amazing.  Fresh mint everywhere!  Made me want a mojito, but I stuck to my guns and had a margarita.\n\nThe patio area is amazing and huge.  Self seating so you can find your own spot that you think will be the best for your dining experience (note, the patio is smoker friendly, which is rare to find a place that is friendly to their smokers).  The thing I liked most was that after the first delivery of water, you are free to go and refill your own glass, not saying that I did, but honestly with as busy as they were, you didn't have to wait for the waiter/waitress to come by for a refill.  As stated before, I had my pitcher of margaritas and my friend opted for a pitcher of XX Amber.  Both at happy hour prices are a great buy and also a great thing to help pass the time.  \n\nWe didn't just come here for the libations, but for the food as well.  I had the potato rolled tacos and my friend opted for chile relleno.  Both looked good but I can only tell you how mine was.  Four rolled and fried tacos filled with potatoes, for an Irish boy like me that has a huge love for Mexican food I was in heaven.  The tacos were topped with a generous amount of guacamole.  I'm not talking about those tiny dollops you get from a fast food chain.  This amount stretched across the four tacos and was a thick line of goodness.  But that shouldn't overshadow the chipotle sauce or queso fresco that also topped the tacos.  A serving of fresh pico was also on the plate, but off to the side so you could scoop as much or as little on top of it all.  The most amazing/surprising thing on the plate was the fried rice.  This is not your typical fried rice.  Think Chinese with a twist.  The rice had the typical corn, peas, and carrots in it.  But I also came across small pieces of potatoes and chicken and I'm sure there were other items in there, but I was too busy mixing everything on my plate at this point.  \n\nThe prices are a bit steep here, but don't let that deter you, it's well worth it.  To say that I will be back here is an understatement.  I think this may be my new favorite Mexican place in the city.  I'm so hungry for it now that I have written this review.", 'business_id': 'zUzEjxKEn8eNVksImZ2oGw', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2013-07-07', 'type': 'review'}

Now, I\'ve been a cocktail server so I\'m usually pretty understanding about service issues...I\'m willing to give Cantina staff the benefit of the doubt that they\'re just chronically understaffed and not that the servers are doing a poor job. But it really shouldn\'t take that long to put in a drink order and, unless its a busy night, making customers get their own water (from a warm jug in the back) isn\'t exactly a nice touch. Also, the food here is pretty terrible. Possibly some of the worst "Mexican" I\'ve had in the city. Finally, while the outdoor area is nice, the back room in the indoor area is kind of depressing. Very poorly lit and bare (and not in a cool, dark dive bar way).\n\nIn spite of this review, I will probably keep coming here.

We sat on the patio, there were only two other groups of people outside.  We waited for about 15 mins for someone to simply take our drink order. We ordered 2 strawberry margaritas and 2 glasses of water and chips and salsa to start, margaritas came-no water.  We drank the margaritas waited for about another 20 mins for chips and salsa asked a very disinterested waitress if we could place a good order with her since we were abandoned by our waiter... Who was talking with the food runner and checking his iPhone... The waitress informed me that I could get my own water from a container across the patio--the other tables had carafes of water... We ordered the Puerco:it was pretty good and the Carnitas: very dry and disappointing.  This was a terrible experience and I am very disappointed! When we finished I started to walk over to get the bill so we could leave and go somewhere else to celebrate, the first waiter finally came over and said he would bring the bill.... Never apologizing or saying anything.... He then started talking to other waiters so he never brought the bill! I had to ask again! I asked for change for a $10 to tip the food runner... The jerk had the audacity to say thank you  as though I was giving HIM the money! I couldn't believe that any of this was really happening!  I finally got my change left money with the runner and got the hell out of there! The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it was a cute patio and the Puerco taco was good.  \n\nSo if you want to be ignored and treated like you are bothering the waitstaff you should check this place out.", 'business_id': 'zUzEjxKEn8eNVksImZ2oGw', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2014-05-12', 'type': 'review'}

But I have to say, after my first visit here I'm not dying to come back.\n\nBefore you even enter this place you have to deal with something that isn't really their fault: parking. And navigating traffic. On Butler Street. Always a joy! Once I managed to deal with this step and actually entered Cantina I wasn't really encouraged; the music was playing too loudly for my taste in the front room and wasn't much better in their back room, which was so dark I had to wonder how people even read their menus if they sit there. \n\nLooking for somewhere a bit quieter and brighter, my dinner companion and I headed to their outdoor patio, where we found high tables and chairs that I honestly thought I'd fall off of at some point during the meal, they were so unsteady. Fortunately that never happened, because we were right next to a part of the fence where the beams were extremely splintered - just thinking about tipping into them was painful!\n\nUnfortunately, the service did absolutely nothing to improve my opinion of the place; I watched three tables that arrived after us get service. No one ever came to our table. After we finally flagged a waitress attending to a group a couple tables over, she said she'd grab our waitress. And we waited some more. While we waited the waitress that we flagged down went ahead and brought us some water...that came in plastic cups. I shudder to imagine just how much trash this place discards every day from these cups alone...\n\nAfter finally ordering and waiting for what at least wasn't an unreasonable amount of time, I was able to enjoy a pretty tasty drink that came in a jar (they have jars for alcohol but not for your water?) but was disappointed with my pork tacos. The shells were kind of mushy and the sauce and toppings minimal; mine just didn't taste all that special. My dinner companion's fish tacos were actually better; I kind of wish we'd swapped.\n\nI left just feeling let down. I honestly would've been happy to forgive this place's rustic look and loud music if the service and food were a bit better, but as it is I just don't see anything here that I'd want to brave the dreaded Butler street traffic again for.", 'business_id': 'zUzEjxKEn8eNVksImZ2oGw', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2014-05-23', 'type': 'review'}

This is where it turned into The Hunger Games. Everyone standing around hawkishly waiting for a table. You make some friends and alliances to get the job done, survive and get a table. While we waited in the middle of this half open air Thunderdome I made my way to the bar to grab a libation. This might be how they keep you busy. The seemingly infinitely patient couple in front of me and I waited for a solid ten minutes before...well whatever the hell was going on was situated and we were asked for our order. Just to stretch my legs, another 5 minutes for 2 sangria, which I will say that both the red and the white are fantastic. I digress. \n\nWe finally won the pity of a family from District 1 who made sure to tell us they were leaving to show their commitment to bestow upon us they\'re semi-primo series of three small tables pushed together saving us from having to shoulder block the 2 middle aged woman to my right from swooping in to protect the Cornucopia. Tables. \n\nThen the hunt for 2 more chairs was on. This is the point in the final few minutes of "The Games" where you expect all the kids to turn on each other. We made enemies. We made friends. You never know how good a person really is till times are dire and you need their help. Our party was complete. Pressed in together snugly on three sides of the tables haphazardly pressed up against the rail (one of the long sides mind you) while the "DON\'T MOVE THE FURNITURE" sign daunted overhead. \n\nWe\'ve sat. We\'ve ordered. War is hell. Really enjoyed that first half hour. \n\nNow I\'m excited.

It was hot so we flagged down another waitress and asked her for water, because the small water dispensers at the back of the patio were empty. We sat for another 15 minutes and the second server finally brought us water and took drink and food orders. After another 40 minutes we received our food, but the drinks came about 10 minutes later.

Another friend got the Chorizo Scramble, which was almost void of potatoes although the menu clearly listed potatoes as a main ingredient. One of my friends got a virgin version of a beverage and was charged the same amount as the alcoholic version, but she didn't bother complaining.

Very vego friendly, with veggie taco options and other snacks and sides, all which are worth trying at some point.

This is the first time I'm writing a review that is one star entirely because of service, because the food itself isn't bad. But the service was awful to the point that it is worth my time to warn people away after my experience there this event. I went in with a few friends for some drinks and snacks at the bar. I'm not sure what his problem was but the bartender was a complete jerk. Service was slow for us food wise and that normally isn't an issue but someone tending bar should be friendly and accommodating not snappy and rude for no reason. We weren't the only ones with an issue, as the bartender decided to yell across the restaurant at another party, making rude remarks about a patron and ordering her to leave. It was like being transported into the soup Nazi episode of Seinfeld and completely shocked us. This place must be doing great if they can afford to have an employee ordering clearly sober and not disorderly customers to leave and put off other customers in the process. It's rare to see a place throw money away like that but after seeing how that lady was treated and after the attitude my group got, they won't be having me back even if their food isn't bad. I can cook at home, I go out to eat for the experience and the service, and Cantina proved that they don't need customers or don't want them, I'm not sure which.

I wanted to try someplace I have never been and it was a gorgeous day, so we decided to check out Round the Corner Cantina =]. The back patio is what brought us in- we arrived rather early, around 5:20pm and the back patio was already packed. We were able to squeeze in on the end of another party's table. \n\nI ordered the elotes (sweet corn on the cob with cheese and spices) to start. WOW. This was honestly some of the best corn I have ever had. The flavor was amazing and it was such a unique dish! $5 for one single corn on the cob though, was a little steep. My sister ordered a cheese quesadilla. I have had corn tortillas in the past, but these were the thickest I have ever had. My sister hated the quesadilla- and I could see why. It was difficult to eat and wasn't very cheesy at all. She was able to eat one of the quesadillas and I took the others home in an attempt to eat them later. I ended up throwing them away because the flavor just wasn't there. I ordered the pollo pibil tacos (roasted chicken). They were a little spicy, but the avocado salsa and pickled red onions cooled it down nicely. They weren't bad- but were nothing super impressive or memorable at all. The tortilla also didn't bother me as much in the tacos as it did in the quesadillas. We also shared an order of fried rice, which was good. I did need to add hot sauce for additional flavor though. Since we came during happy hour, our chips and salsa were free- saving us about $4-5. The salsa was very watery (as a lot of homemade salsas are) but very good. It had a slight kick to it, which I loved. The chips were clearly made in house and were sprinkled in sea salt and were pretty good. We also ordered a grilled green onion as well, which was literally a grilled green onion with oil, pepper and salt. It was also pretty good and gave me a new idea for summer grilling! Our server was very friendly and accommodating to my sister and I. He was busy but remained attentive to our table the entire time =].\n\nMy overall rating would be 2.5 stars but I rounded up.

I had really REALLY high expectations for this place, and while I wouldn't say I was let down, there were a couple things that didn't quite sit right with me, ergo my 3 star rating. \n\nFirst, I called earlier this evening to ask a quick question, and not only did no one answer, but their voicemail was full.. not ok for a business in my opinion. Second, when we got there, the bartenders were really super unhelpful. When you first walk in, you step right into the bar area.. it's small, dark, and kinda cramped.. kinda divey, which is not an issue, but if you're unfamiliar with the place, as we were, it can be kinda hard to find your way around.. and when the bartenders offer no help whatsoever, it makes it that much more awkward. So we finally found our way to the back patio, which is really super awesome. We sit down at the bar, only to be told that this bar has just closed.. ugh! So we grab a table, which was fine, just not what we had in mind.  \n\nFrom that point, the service was prompt and decent. Our server was friendly and helpful, and our food came out super fast. We got the queso as an appetizer and it was AMAZING. Seriously the best queso I've ever had anywhere. So good! I got the Shrimp Tacos as my meal, and they were good.. no super amazing queso, but good. My white sangria was decent. Again, nothing special but I enjoyed it.  \n\nBy the time we left, we both agreed that we were happy we tried it and we'll be going back soon I'm sure. I would definitely recommend the back patio, it's a really cool place with a great atmosphere.

I\'m a shorter guy so it takes a little effort at the bar to get a drink. The bartender (a male) notices me and says "I\'ll be right there bud" - which I hate, no one wants to be called "bud." I\'m having a conversation with a friend but I\'m very obviously the next person in line and I keep making the "I need a drink" motions.

[But the words not the acronym.] "You said you were going to be "right here bud, then you take he guys behind me\'s order?!" \n\nBartender snaps his fingers and before I know it the doorman- or whoever he is- is trying to escort me out.

I say "I have been chill but okay." \n\nThe doorman \'allows\' me to stay. I order a double jack and diet- I never order doubles but I knew I had to because I didn\'t want to relive the aforementioned experience.\n\n$18 jack and diet double. $18.00. Yes, eighteen. \n\nNot going back.

We were looking for a place to have dinner, so I looked through my pack of City Dining Cards.  Based on the options available, my cousin and I both decided on Round Corner, so we headed over to Lawrenceville to check it out.\n\nAt the time of our visit, it had just finished raining, so almost all of the tables on the patio were empty.  We decided to hedge our bets by sitting at the outdoor bar, which had partly covered seats.  Fortunately, it didn't rain any more, and the rest of the tables on the patio filled up during the time of our visit.  To get to the patio, when you walk in the front door, proceed to the doorway at the far end of the bar and you'll see another doorway leading to it right after that (this wasn't clear to us upon first entering!).  I highly recommend sitting on the patio if possible, since it's quite nice, whereas the indoor rooms are dark and stuffy.\n\nOnce seated, we started off by ordering chips and guacamole ($7), which came out in about 5 min.  The chips were underseasoned and had a bit of a waxy texture, and the dip was fresh (containing avocado chunks) but wasn't super flavorful.  Nevertheless, they served their purpose as an appetizer by giving us something to munch on while awaiting the rest of our order.  This was a good thing, since the rest of our order took 30 min. to come out, which the bartender said was due to the printer in the kitchen breaking.\n\nFor our entrees, my cousin ordered the pescado (fish) tacos ($9), and I ordered the carnitas (pork) tacos ($9).  We each exchanged a taco with one another so that we could both try both different types of tacos.  I found the tacos mediocre in flavor and composition, esp. for the price.  The fish was the better of the two--the shell of the pork taco fell apart while I ate it due to grease, and the meat was a bit chewy.  We also ordered the elote (Mexican street corn; $5) as a side item. This was by far the best part of the meal--the cotija cheese topping was quite delicious.  Even so, the corn was a bit mushy, which detracted from the overall effect.\n\nOverall, I was less than impressed with the quality of the food at Round Corner, esp. for the price (fortunately, we didn't pay full price thanks to the City Dining Card).  And, needless to say, I wasn't exactly pleased with having to wait so long for the main order, esp. after the initial order was fulfilled so quickly.  However, the patio provides a nice environment, and our service from the bartender was good, notwithstanding the kitchen delay.  If you're looking for great traditional tacos, I suggest Las Palmas in Oakland or Edgar's in the Strip, and if you're looking for delicious upscale tacos, I recommend Tako downtown.  In general, I'd suggest sticking to drinks and apps at Round Corner, and giving most of the food a pass.  2.5 stars.", 'business_id': 'zUzEjxKEn8eNVksImZ2oGw', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2015-09-13', 'type': 'review'}

Excited at the thought of enjoying semi-authentic Mexican tacos for $5 a pair, I knew I had to come check out this deal. After all, having closed for a few months due to liquor license issues, this place may offer new thrills and flair that didn't exist before. Our group was immediately able to find seats in the outdoor patio, thinking we were lucky that the other people of Lawrenceville were not taking advantage of this deal. We were served by a petite brunette waitress with curly hair wrapped in a bun. She went over the drink special and proceeded to take our drink order, all business without a smile (which is fine). Since we were a large group, we ordered a decent amount, and then each of us ordered 1-2 orders of tacos each, salivating at the thought of $5 tacos.\n\nOur tacos eventually came out, which came in pairs and were okay in quality. I'll never complain about $5 tacos though. We eventually got the check but were confused why all of our tacos except for 4 were listed at full price. After notifying the waitress, she gives us an empty stare and then says that only 3 of the listed tacos are $5. Mind you, the menu has no mention of any of their specials and does not explicitly say that only certain tacos are $5 during their Monday special. She then goes to grab the manager (or at least someone who claims he's the manager; he actually bartends at the front bar), who comes to our table and apologizes on the waitress's behalf by saying that the waitress is correct and that she clearly told us about the taco special's specifications. According to him, the only reason why all 7 of us magically did not hear her mention anything about the taco special was because we were all talking when she was going over them. To top it all off, he justified it by saying that she's one of their best servers (love high standards) so he has to go by her word. After all, the customer is always WRONG.\n\nAstonished and appalled that the manager was blaming us, we proceeded to insist that the waitress never mentioned anything and that a restaurant menu should have explicit information saying so. He then says that the sign outside the restaurant, which happens to point towards a side street away from the main entrance, clearly states the details of this special. Furthermore, he exclaimed that since they re-opened, they had to cut back on their specials. I'm sorry you guys closed because you failed to renew your liquor license; it was totally our fault. Fed up, we paid our bill and left for good. Only at Round Corner is the customer always wrong.", 'business_id': 'zUzEjxKEn8eNVksImZ2oGw', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2015-09-21', 'type': 'review'}

I usually don\'t have a strong opinion about things.  I\'ve never in my life asked to speak to a manager about something negative.  It would take something pretty major for me to share my thoughts on the web.  But dinner tonight really pushed me over the edge.\n\nLong story short, we went to Round Corner Cantina for their $5 Monday night taco special, ordered a bunch of $5 tacos, and then got our check which showed many of our tacos were $9 or $10.  We figured it was a mistake, so we kindly waited until we got the attention of our waitress and let her know.  She, with the same blank stare and flat affect she displayed throughout the night, told us only 3 of the tacos on the menu were on the $5 special.  We were surprised to hear this and told her there was no indication on the menu about which were on special, and she had never mentioned to us that only some were on special.  She seemed disinterested from the start of the conversation and deflected our questions to the manager.\n\nAfter a few minutes, the manager came by and we told him what the confusion was.  At first, we had hoped to talk to him to try to explain the confusion and if anything, help them make it clear to future customers who were also unaware.  But his response to our concerns completely changed everything (hence why I\'m writing my first Yelp comment).  His first words were "She (the waitress) told you guys when you got here about the special, but she said you were talking to one another and didn\'t hear her."  WHAT??? ARE YOU SERIOUS DUDE?? The manager of this restaurant seriously just blamed us for talking to one another (I don\'t know what you rest of you folks out there do at restaurants) and not listening when our disinterested waitress supposedly explained things to us.  Even if she did tell us these things (which I\'m pretty confident she didn\'t), wouldn\'t she have tried to get our attention?  Talking to the back of peoples\' heads seems counterproductive.\n\nWhen we voiced that none of us could recall this, he responded, "Well I have to take her word because she\'s one of the best servers" (God Bless America) and he couldn\'t do anything to help us.  Is this guy serious? He\'s going to tell a large party of customers that their lack of attention to his lackluster, eye-rolling (again, I\'m not the type to normally care about these things) waitress is their problem and that they should essentially deal with it. Wow. Just wow.  I know we all have good days and bad days.  I\'ve had bad days where I\'d probably come across as lackluster and flat, but I would never take my own misdoings and blame it on the customers who support my business\' success.\n\nI\'ll never go back to Round Corner. I\'m honestly upset about that because I thought the food was pretty decent, especially for [what I thought was] $5.  There are just some things in life you don\'t do and this was one of them.  I hope all of you reading out there have better experiences, because nobody deserves a pleasant night out with friends to be tarnished by a manager who is too weak to own up to his own mistake.', 'business_id': 'zUzEjxKEn8eNVksImZ2oGw', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2015-09-21', 'type': 'review'}
