Service is very friendly and helpful.\n\nThe food:\nWe started with a "salad roll" (all veggie) that was served with a peanut dipping sauce.  I like it a bit spicy so I mixed in a bit of the chili sauce ... good eats.  I wasn\'t sure what kind of pho I wanted, so I went with the "special beef bowl" ... minus the tendon (cant\' get past the texture of that stuff.  I found the broth tasty and the beef, noodles, and veggies all very good.  I mixed in a bit of the chili again just to give it some kick.  My wife tried the chicken pho, pretty good ... looked like mostly white meat if not all.  She enjoyed it.\n\nThe bottom line:\nGood food, reasonable prices.

This is crazy I thought. I have been there many times and I love this place. The low rating is unjustified and made me decide to sign up for yelp and write my first review.\n\nWhat this place is... A good place to get cheap Pho or Vietnamese food. \n\nThe Pho portions are generous. If you order an extra large Pho bowl and have them split it there is plenty of food for 2 people and it's even cheaper.\n\nYou can even bring your own alcohol (beer, wine whatever) and they will give you glasses. I think this is great because everyone knows alcoholic drinks are one of the biggest profit margins for restaurant and one of the easiest ways to run up the bill. The decor is decent and the place seemed pretty clean. The food is at least as good as any other Vietnamese restaurant I have been to. The ingredients like basil, bean sprouts lime, etc. seem fresh.\n\nThis is a mom and pop place and I think the service is very good. They seem to remember my GF and me every time we go in. Be prepared... The waitresses (Tao) is very sarcastic but she is super nice and gives great service.\n\nI saw some other reviewers comparing this restaurant to Cyclo. I don't think this is a valid comparison. Cyclo is decent but you are paying for the trendy atmosphere. Chandler Pho is simple but good food and much cheaper. I liken this place to Little Saigon but newer.\n\n\nBottom line... Good food and cheap.

I won't return since it's out of our way (we were going to a play at Hamilton High).  Hubbie got a beef soup that had the gelatinous beef in it (w/ brisket too) that you either tolerate or will make someone like me gag.  He much prefered the beef soup he can get at Saigon Pho.  Daughter got the Pho Ga and she liked it and thought it was comparable to Anise but I was thinking no way just looking at the dish.  I got the lemongrass chicken and it was waaaaaayyy too sweet...and I have a tremendous sweeth tooth.

She remembers us and our typical orders even though we\'ve only been there maybe 4 or 5 times. She even served my mom a free appetizer and iced tea for her birthday today! I would have to say she is one of the reasons we keep coming back.\n\nThe other reason would be the "un-pho-gettable" pho! The bowls are huge! (Even the normal size.) We always leave with leftovers without having to empty our wallets. The prices are very affordable and we love the flavor of their pho. And if you\'re looking for a great appetizer, try their fried calamari! Simply delish!\n\nThe only reason this place misses the 5-star mark is because I don\'t think some of the waiters/waitresses that bring out the food speak English very well, or aren\'t very sociable, at least. We had some difficulty communicating that we wanted an extra plate and bowl. Also, their "specials" aren\'t anything special in particular.

I'll give them a few extra points however as they had just the right crisp. The accompanying sauce was the real winner. Spring roll was much like any spring roll you'd get at any other Pho joint. For the main course, we went for a spicy egg noodle with pork and beef. It was deeeeelish. We requested medium heat, and I would say it was more mild-medium, so definitely plan on talking your heat request up a notch. Overall, food was well prepared, clean and seasoned well.\n\nPrice - My wife and I had all that was reviewed above for less than 20 bucks.

I'm not usually a fan of chicken in a potsticker but these were very good.\n\nThen my son ordered the Mongolian Beef and I ordered the Pad Thai. Yeah, I know that the Pho is the way to go. They even have Pho in the name right. But I did not feel like a really big bowl of soup although it did look very good at the tables around us. \n\nThe Beef was to sweet and a bit tough. It was OK but I would not order it again. Neither would my son. He didn't like it at all. He did eat all the rice and had three of the potstickers so he had enough.\n\nThe Pad Thai. Actually quite good although it could have had more shrimp and less tofu.  It only had 4 medium shrimp that were a little chewy. Now while the shrimp were tough and slim Pickens the noodles, sauce and other ingredients were very good and very fresh.\n\nBetter than Pei Wei for sure as the noodles were not under cooked and over seasoned.\n\nI will definitely will be back as its very close to home and its also pretty good. I got some Spring Rolls to go and will have them tomorrow with my leftovers. \n\nAs for a good lunch combo I recommend Thai Rama on Chandler Blvd by Dobson.

My coffee came out quickly, but the juice took awhile.  I felt bad drinking my coffee and joked that they must be picking out oranges from a grove and freshly squeezing them.  And guess what?

My friend and boyfriend were quite impressed and happy.  \n\nAs for the food, we ordered a plate of pan-fried potstickers (tasted very fresh as well), and all of us ordered their seafood pho which is their specialty.  The broth is made from snow crabs, and you do get pieces of the crab in your soup.  The crab is actually REAL in an ACTUAL SHELL and not the imitation kind.

I quietly asked if they had put their name down or anything and was cut off by a lady in full rage about being "in line" for a table because no one had taken her name down.\n\nTo anger the lady even further, I grabbed a server and let her know we had a reservation for 8, in which we were immediately seated in the first 2 available 4-person booths.

Went for lunch with the hubs on a week day. Got in around 11:30am so we could beat the crazy lunch rush. Ordered the usual, egg rolls (delish by the way) and our pho bowls.  This is where things started to go downhill.  1) I ordered the large pho (I love me some extra broth) but I got the regular. 2) Hubs ordered a side of extra meat on the side. No extra meat on the side (they tried to tell us at the end that it was put into the soup. Nice try, but that's funny that every other time they've put it on the side.). 3) Asked for cilantro (I like a little pho with my cilantro, thank you very much), and they were OUT. Completely out of cilantro. How the hell does that happen?? At 11:30am? Are you kidding me.  3 strikes and you're out.

The chicken had a weird taste / smell & the shrimp wasn't much better ... It had the texture of frozen shrimp that had been overcooked. I tried a bite of the Pho & couldn't have much more than that but my companion enjoyed it.\n\nThe awful part was that the table was really sticky and there were soup spoons in a holder which I had to pick through 3 of them to find a clean one to use. Also, there were some patrons at a table just next to us who asked to move b/c there were ants all over their table. When we got to the front to pay our bill, we also saw some ants on the counter & there were 2 people who worked there standing right by them who made no effort to clean it up!

This place has them beat on consistency and flavor of the food. \n\nThe prices are awesomely cheap. It is CLEAN!! The staff is always extremely friendly. It's a smaller restaurant though , so the waits can get a little long.In a tiny restaurant on a Saturday night 20 minutes wait isn't the end of the world though. \n\nMy fiance decided to get the Seafood Pho ,and I went for the meatball and eye of round Pho. We split an order of egg rolls with lettuce ,mint ,and cilantro as an appetizer. (Real romaine lettuce not iceberg)\n\nBoth of our entrees arrived at the same time. My fiance loved the fact that his had recognizable seafood. No Krab just real crab in the shell. \n\nAs for mine. Meatball and Eye of round Pho is my go to when I get Vietnamese. This is the best one I've ever had. Vietnamese meatballs have a tendency to be tough and rubbery. Not here. They had real flavor ,and there was a good amount of both types of meat. The broth was what originally won me over during my first visit here, and it has consistently been just as good each time. You can taste the subtle star anise flavor that Pho is know for, along with the deep beef flavor that a lot of places I've been to fell short on. \n\nWe have decided to make it a point to come here at least once a month because we both enjoy it so much.", 'business_id': '4zfrcEmGvZ4oYKx_revTxA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2014-11-29', 'type': 'review'}

We have grown quite disappointed in the other Pho restaurants around us (near Dobson and Warner) and so went to Yelp to find another location.

Clean inside, tables are bused using a cart and bin (a lot better than other Vietnamese restaurants I've been to). The menu is straightforward, the Vietnamese staples. \n\nWe started with Cha Gio and Goi Cuon, both excellent. The Goi Cuon was very good, and they used the marinated grilled pork, which was a very nice twist.\n\nWe had Pho Tai, but the interesting thing about this restaurant is that can be ordered in Large and Extra Large. Given my appetite, I ordered the extra large. My wife and son had Buon Cha Gio Thit Nuong, which is rice noodle vermicelli with fried pork rolls and a very tasty marinated grilled pork. With fish sauce, this dish was excellent, probably the best I've had outside of my mother's home. \n\nThe Pho was fresh, with a rich broth which I found to be tasty and not oily, as it sometimes can be.\n\nWe have found our new Pho location.

You coerced me to come into your family\'s restaurant to try it out, and so I had to take you up on the offer and now I am here writing your review. (Just for anyone reading, I\'ve known Hoang since 4th grade and he has NEVER informed me that his family owns one of the best Vietnamese joints in the valley.) I\'m surprised he would want me to write a review because I\'m highly critical. So here we go: \n\nChandler Pho, you\'re freakin amazing. I wish I can take your cooks home with me. \n\nAs an appetizer, my husband and I always go for the egg rolls. Now, we\'re die hard Saigon fans (as I stated in my review for AZ Pho & Grill in Gilbert) and I have yet gone to a restaurant that can top them. Welp, I found one. Now the only difference between P.C and Saigon is that P.C\'s egg rolls use chicken and Saigon uses pork. Slight difference in taste, but I gotta admit, the chicken is pretty damn good. It definitely gives it a "lighter" taste and I can bet it has far less calories than the pork (win win). I got their Thai Iced Tea, and again, super delicious.  \n\nNow, my husband and I both got our regular go to pho: Ph T\xe1i (eye of round steak pho). Our opinion, again, just fabulous. They gave us AMPLE amounts of sprouts, thai basil, two giant slices of jalapeno, and juicy lime wedges. The taste was great and not too greasy. You can definitely taste the spices; far from bland. In other words, you can taste the love in this soup.\n\nWe saw that there was a kids menu and I definitely applaud them for that. Very rarely do you see a kids menu at a Vietnamese joint, let alone one with quite a few decently priced choices. We ended up getting the chicken lo mein for our two year old daughter. Sadly, she ended up not eating it because she was absolutely obsessed with our pho. But I gotta say, I\'ve never had better lo mein. Seriously, I\'ve been to NUMEROUS Chinese places and this by far, is the best lo mein I\'ve ever had in my life. \n\nThe atmosphere is quaint. On the smaller side, but who cares. Better get there before the dinner rush. Servers were very polite and were prompt to get us what we requested. It was clean and decorated well.\n\nI give Chandler Pho 5/5 stars. Not because I know someone who has the in, but because they genuinely have amazing food. I will recommend them to all my friend\'s who want to try great pho and egg rolls.', 'business_id': '4zfrcEmGvZ4oYKx_revTxA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2015-01-13', 'type': 'review'}

This is a bit plain for me as the broth is somewhat bland but I do enjoy getting noodles and wontons in a soup.\n\nThis place is almost busy so if you come at the wrong time, you may be waiting awhile or they may even seat you at a table with other people .', 'business_id': '4zfrcEmGvZ4oYKx_revTxA', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2015-04-15', 'type': 'review'}

The food was just very fresh and cooked properly.  The Shrimp and Papaya appetizer was especially good.  The Pho was great, the chandler special w/egg on top was fantastic!  Green beans awesome too! Try the pad thai - that was everyone's favorite.  Beef short ribs also lovely.  I don't think anything on their menu is bad, as all the items we ordered we wonderful and the price is amazing!

It also comes with a red si racha sauce which adds to the dish.  It did not have a lot of seafood in the dish but, then again I only paid 9 bucks.  Four shrimp, two scallops, and three pieces of crab legs (seafood portions 4 stars). But the flavor of the soup with the cilantro, fresh jalape\xf1o slices and onions were a 5 out of 5 stars. The spices in the soup create a symphony of seafood and spice flavors in your mouth. \nI would give the meal an overall 4.5 stars.  Would like to try other dishes....UPDATE!!!\n\n\nMy original review of this place would have been a 4,5 stars out of 5 until I saw my bank statement and noticed that the restaurant decided to add an unauthorized 50% tip to my to-go bill.

This time, the whole place was packed to the brim with people spilling out the door. Oh no! I hurried to a server asking if I could be placed on a list. She pointed to the door where people were scribbling their names down. And of course several parties who came after me were writing their names down. But, I don't blame them, being busy is a good thing! \n\nAfter waiting for almost 10 mins, I saw someone sitting alone on the counter bar. I asked a server if I could sit there solo. Not particularly pleased about the confusion, I decided to give the food a chance.\n\nIt came out within 10 mins of ordering so I was happy about that.
