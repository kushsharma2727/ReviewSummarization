It's too much for me to eat at dinner and it's about eight bucks!\nThe pot roast sounds simple, and it is, but dang, it's so yummy.  Super tender meat and homemade mashed potatoes with just the right about of gravy and topped with fried parsnips.  You can't go wrong.\n\nI'm very disappointed that two things I loved on the menu are gone.  First, is the ahi salad, it was really good.  When I inquired, I was told that with the rising costs of ahi that it wasn't a cost effective option.  I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED the blackened chicken sandwich.  I craved it.  Blackened chicken with applewood smoked bacon, jack cheese on a grilled bun.  They changed.  Dammit!  Why?  I'm holding a little grudge on that one.\n\nAt lunch, I always get the soup and salad.

I switched to their draft beers which are from several small breweries and much more worth your time.\n\nNext came my Ahi Tuna special which was definitely not worth the price tag. Very bland. Didn't seem like they should even be serving it if they don't know how to make it interesting. Although the rice side dish that came with it was great. Other's in my group who had steak, salmon, and such were much more pleased.\n\nI gave them a chance to redeem themselves with their Croissant Bread Pudding which sounded phenomenal, especially to a bread pudding man like myself. Again it was fairly par for the course and not worth its price tag.

Now PCG makes a darn creamy rich flavorful Mac N\' Cheese and that to me signifies attention to quality.

The Brie dish in particular was divine. \n\nFor a special night out or just drinks in the bar (hopefully Frank is working when you go), you will not be disappointed!", 'business_id': 'Pfb6VOIiroqDWOebfgWGPQ', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2009-07-30', 'type': 'review'}

But we were happy with the options, nice for those who wanted a good steak or entree, or for those who want something on the cheaper side of the menu. \n\nThe waitress Kathryn was friendly and quick though she had a lot of tables. Water was prompt and drinks and wine served within a few minutes of order. We ordered the Goat Cheese toast points and it took a while to get to the table, but they were worth it. Really Yummy. \n\nMy friends ordered the Phoenix Cheese Steak and the Black and Bleu Burger. Both looked really good, and they received good feedback. I ordered the Rose something Chicken and it was really good with the tarragon au jus. The best though was the Pork Tenderloin, super yummy and totally worth the price. It was really flavorful with the jalapeno jelly they basted it with, and the meat had a really smoky flavor to the meat. The quinoa cakes were really tasty for quinoa. We decided to do dessert and the buttermilk pie was amazing. I'm from the South and this was the real deal. The Bread pudding was really good as was the Chocolate torte. \n\nOverall very happy with this restaurant. We will definitely be coming back.

Green chiles could have had more heat to them, but that burger was cooked perfectly, not too greasy, juicy bites on a nice firm roll that held up all the way through. And great pickles, too.

Phoenix City Grill, which sports happy hour from 3pm-close. Yes, til close!!! Sweet baby Jesus, finally someone answered my wishes! \n\nFirst off, the decor was lovely, as was the ambiance. Happy hour is only available in the bar area, where I quickly ventured to. Some of the happy hour items are: Beef sliders with yummy Tillamook cheese (whaddup Oregon!!!), grilled fish tacos, hummus, Green chile cheese dip, beef and chicken skewers, etc. All in all, a great selection with wonderful execution. \n\nThe liquor selection is also solid. Any bar that has items, such as Plum Vodka, gets a thumbs up in my book. The wine selection is also good. \n\nPCG is right off the 51 and also closely located to my dive (yes, my personal dive) the Swizzle. \n\nMy only gripe: The bar area was serviced by one waiter - the bartender. So, being that he was making drinks for the restaurant side as well as serving the bar area, the service suffered. He was not nice, inattentive, and at times rude. \n\nI was able to ignore him as the food made its way to my belly.', 'business_id': 'Pfb6VOIiroqDWOebfgWGPQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2010-01-29', 'type': 'review'}

I have read good reviews and heard good things from friends. Last night I made there. I will return for sure. Its nice inside. The lighting is a little on the dark side which is good with me. The bar is nice but wish there was more seating. I had the pomegranate margarita and oh yeah it was so good. I only had one cause they were $9 then I just went with water. But the cool thing is they have PBR for $2, got to love that and happy hour form 3-close. Yeah I'll be there. The happy hour menu looks great and cant wait to try it out. \n\nSo on to the food. I had the Surf N Turf Pasta. Its is Grilled beef tenderloin medallion and jumbo Sea of Cortez shrimp over fettuccine tossed with tomatoes, mushrooms and sweet corn in a green chile butter sauce. It was delicious. The beef was cooked a perfect med rare and the wood grill flavor really came thru. The shrimp were great wish there was more shrimp. I did get the small portion so more shrimp with the large . Small was $14 large is $18. My friend ordered the Grilled Beef Tenderloin which is Wood grilled 8oz. center cut filet with chipotle cheddar stuffed potato and sherry glazed mushrooms. $27 These mushrooms were like candy they should serve them for an app cause I know I'd get them. I wanted to get dessert but I had a long night ahead of me so I will have to get something next time. I did see a few desserts come out and looked great. Overall the place is great and I have a feeling I will become a regular. The server we had was the nicest guy.

I think a restaurant experience should match its rating caliber and sadly it did not. No four stars for fabulousness, it\'s three stars because it\'s ok and that\'s not shabby at all.\n\nWent to dinner with the other half of our awesome pair... my besty Sara V. on a whim. We\'ve been thinking alike lately... and while I was at work... I kept on thinking that it would be nice to go out to dinner... and unsurprisingly Sara V. was thinking the same too... I swear it\'s like we have ESPN or something! Anywho, I had her come up with the dinner choices since she knows I\'m a really picky person (I say I\'m not but I really am =P), she texted me the top 3... and I chose PCG since I had read Jana S. earlier review on the place and I\'ve always wanted to try out this place!\n\nAnywho, we got to the restaurant and I really like the intersection it\'s at, at Bethany Home Rd. and 16th St. coz it\'s across from Luci\'s Market and Richardson\'s, and an awesome looking Starbucks. In a strange way that intersection has a little character plus it\'s in an older section of upper central Phoenix. I like the setup with the tables outside and the large picture windows. \n\nWe were seated immediately at a two seater booth, noticed it was quite busy, and i liked the general ambiance of the place. We were thinking of the happy hour when we were heading there but were dismayed to read on their large easel board that hh tues. - fri. was from 3p to 6p but on Monday\'s it\'s from 3p to close. So we made a mental note that we\'ll come back for hh on Monday. We were seated and waited for our server, waters were dropped off, and our server passed with a passing remark "I\'ll be right back". Well she did come back after 10 mins. which I ordered a glass of reisling, and an order of the Roasted Green Chile Fundido Queso (ever since our trip in Austin for SXSW last year, we\'ve been looking for a place that serves Queso as to satisfy our Queso fix from TX of which we have yet to find a place, maybe it\'s a Texas thing). My glass with a small carafe of wine was served... wet. The wine glass was wet! Like it had been just washed and they didn\'t take the time to dry the glass, no they served the glass WET and our server poured some of the reisling into the WET wine glass. Ok... there went a star. who serves wine in a wet glass?!? apparently PCG does. So, we\'re waiting to order, mind you, our server did not stop to give suggestions, mention the soup of the day, no we waited, and we had to ask for suggestions, and ask what the soup of the day was. Heck if you\'re a good restaurant, wouldn\'t you want to welcome your customers, who if you win them with good service and good food will come back, or are you happily satisfied with the customers and your fans that you\'re not interested in winning a few more? Ok... deep breath. \n\nI ordered the PCG pasta as suggested by our server, and Sara V. ordered the Smoked Baby Back Ribs (rubbed in Chipotle bbq sauce). Oh did I mention that I had to ask for Sara V.\'s water refill the first time round and flag her down to get a diet coke. Sara and I could see the poor girl was handling way too many tables to guarantee good service but that\'s no excuse. I think there\'s an expectation that a restaurant of such acclaim should provide great service. \n\nThe PCG pasta was quite good, liked the roasted garlic and chardonnay cream sauce, it wasn\'t overly creamy, loved the sun dried tomatoes though, it was delicious. Sara V.\'s baby back ribs had a kick with them, it was spicy! and the green chile cornbread was okay not bandera\'s skillet corn bread good though. Oh, the queso was alright as well except i wish it was a little more thicker, this queso seemed too runny but it was a good starter nevertheless. We finished our meal with a slice of the buttermilk pie which had a caramel sauce and pomegranate seeds as garnish, which was the right accompaniment to something rich and sweet. \n\nOverall the food was very good but the service had me wishing it was better and it did affect my overall dining experience. I will come back for the happy hour but I will have to pass on a glass of wine... unless they can guarantee it\'ll be served in a dry wine glass. And maybe some attentive service. So hopefully next time I\'ll get my four stars, we\'ll see.', 'business_id': 'Pfb6VOIiroqDWOebfgWGPQ', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2010-03-18', 'type': 'review'}

But I have to say, it seems to grow on me every time I eat there. The most recent trip was for Mother's Day brunch. After looking at various Phoenix eateries' menus to decide where to take my mom, I knew the Grille was it. Their brunch menu is quite a few steps above and for the prices, a great culinary investment. I had the griddled corn cakes (mmmm....) and you get a choice of meat. So I had diced smoked ham hidden in between them. It came with black beans and cheese, potatoes and maple syrup. Mom had short rib with a poached, breaded egg on top and a tangy red onion relish. The egg was a gem and the breading wasn't incredibly greasy. To top it off, they were giving moms a carnation flower. Nice touch. As for dinner, I highly recommend the pot roast. And I don't know anywhere else that serves up their quinoa and goat cheese cakes (what a yummy combo). And they do try to buy locally when they can.

My parents just moved back to Scottsdale after living in Houston for 2 years, and on our way home we realized we were starving, so my mom remembered the PCG and suggested we try it again after at least 5 years not having been there. It's a little off the beaten path (although easily accessible from the 51), but I have to say that it was one of the best meals we'd had out in AGES!!!! I live downtown Chicago, where the culinary/dining scene is truly one of the best in the US, and the quality and presentation of the food here really impressed me. Just a fantastic place.\n\nMy mom and I decided to try a bunch of appetizers, and my dad had the pork tenderloin.  We had the fish tacos, the bacon-wrapped shrimp, the griddled corn cakes, and the crab cakes.  I cannot tell you how fantastic each and every one of these appetizers was!!! The fish tacos were the best we'd EVER had--and we're a major fish taco-eating family! Fresh grilled fish with a chipotle-lime aioli and pickled red onions--just fantastic. The bacon-wrapped shrimp were HUGE! I don't know where they get these shrimp, but they're incredible, and stuffed with cotija cheese. Yes, a little rich, but absolutely delicious.  The griddled corn cakes--incredible! They totally balance that sweet-salty thing that everyone loves, and the corn cakes were soft, fluffy, and surprisingly very light.  Then the crabcakes. We're originally from Maryland so we're VERY picky about our crabcakes--and we were shocked to discover they actually did them correctly!! Fresh, lump crabmeat (not shredded!) and very little filling, served with an incredible lemon aioli sauce and a little salad. Just amazing!\n\nMy dad had the pork tenderloin, and he's a bit of a picky eater and left not a single scrap on his plate! I love how the waiter asked him how he wanted it prepared (yes, you can have pork tenderloin done medium), and it was served with jalapeno preserves, these incredible mashed potatoes, and roasted root vegetables. My dad cleaned his entire plate and loved every bite.  \n\nOn top of it all (yes, we were stuffed!), we decided to split a dessert--the bread pudding, which was absolutely DELICIOUS. Not overly sweet or rich, and nicely presented. Excellent coffee, too.\n\nI was so pleasantly surprised by how great the Phoenix City Grille was that I just HAD to put a review on Yelp (and this is my first!).  Our server was excellent, and I don't have a bad thing to say about this place.  I wish it were in Chicago!

All restaurant owners need to take a page out of this guys book. Reason in a second. Let's talk about food first.\n\nI had the baby back ribs and the were awesome. Not quite as good as the baby backs from Houstons but pretty darn close. My girlfriend who loves PCG decided to go with something different this time around and ordered one of their signature dishes. It was some sort of chicken. I do consider myself a foodie so the first thing I was thinking is how can chicken be a signature dish? Chicken is boring no matter what you do with it. Anyway, it wasn't that good and the chicken comes on the bone which my girlfriend didn't like. So, since it was a signature dish, recommended by the waiter, I had to return it. My philosphy is that if something is recommended and is a signature dish and it doesn't give you a mouthgasim, it gets returned. So the waiter nicely takes it back and apologizes multiple times and asks if we would like something else. My girlfriend orders her old PCG standby, the Pork Tenderloin. Wow what a great pork dish. I don't care for pork that much but i must say i crushed half of it, it was amazing.\n\nDo I even need to explain the choclate tort??? YUM\n\nBack to the owner. We arrive at PCG at about 4pm to eat dinner, who eats at 4pm, you'd think we went for the early bird special. We get seated in the dining room and are the only ones in the dining room and no one comes out for like 10 minutes. So we move to the bar  and tell the bar tender we are going to eat at the bar because no one came out to greet us or take a drink order. He apologizes, bvut it was NO BIG DEAL. We weren't mad or complaining or anything. Remember earlier I mentioned the signature dish that got sent back. Well the owner comes over to us and says i understand you have had some issues today and we are like ah no problem the food was great yada yada yada. The owner is like NO BOTH of your meals are on me including dessert. We objected and were like you don't have to do that and he INSISTED. Who does this now a days in the restauran business? Most definately not Donovans.\n\nAnyway to sum it up. PCG is awesome, the owner actually cares about his customers and everyone i tell this story to they are like i can't believe he did that. Go to Phoenix City Grille you won't be disappointed. KUDOS to PCG and especially you Mr. Owner, sorry I don't remember your name. I'll be for some ribs soon.", 'business_id': 'Pfb6VOIiroqDWOebfgWGPQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2010-08-23', 'type': 'review'}

There were 6 specials, 2 which caught my eye. After settling on one, we ordered and were told they were out of 4 of the 6 specials. Might I add it was about 12:15pm. That seemed a little early to be running out of specials. The food we ordered ended up to be OK. \n\nIf you haven't eaten here, you must. If given the option I would pick 3.5 stars.

It was accompanied by fried green beans. The sort rib was good. Definitely tender with a real hearty, rich, beefy flavor. There was only 1 scallop. It was a little tougher than the ones showcased at our event. \n\nTrying to minimize the calories, I asked for plain green beans instead. The kitchen sent out the fried which our server quickly noted and corrected, leaving the fried ones for my dinner partner to enjoy. Lacking any substantive willpower, I nibbled one or two and they were quite tasty. A light tempura coating combined with the cooking technique offered a unique, enjoyable flavor. \n\nMy "plain" green beans were dressed in olive oil with garlic, salt and pepper (just like I make at home). Still crisp, they were delicious! \n\nSo, I got my wish with the special, but the the regular menu challenges decision-making abilities with so many great options! \n\nMy friend got the beef tenderloin and it was, quite possibly, the best steak I\'ve had in the Valley. It was fabulously tender (even cooked medium well) and perfectly seasoned. I look forward to ordering one for myself on a future visit. \n\nI had heard about the bread pudding from the CMYE reviews and so we splurged with dessert. It was phenomenal! Think the fluffiest, most custardy french toast flavor you\'ve ever had! Thank goodness it was cut into two pieces -- better for a peaceful sharing. \n\nAnother tip from the CMYE, thanks to Don S., I tried the Brophy Clark Pinot Noir ($11/glass) and it was love at first sip!

I don't like it when margaritas are sugary so this one was perfect, and a great way to get my Christmas festivities started. \n\nFor my main course I opted to try the sea bass special. It came with almond crusted asparagus and some garlicky (and insanely buttery) rosemary mashed potatoes. How would I describe the entire meal? In one word, perfection! That sea bass was so fresh and delicious it practically swam right up to my plate. You can't really go wrong with asparagus but this wasn't just your regular vegetable. They coated the asparagus with a crunchy layer of almonds and it was soooooo tasty. And yeah, the mashed potatoes tasted like they had about 5 cubes of butter in them... but that's the best way to make em!\n\nI wish I had known about this place sooner because it really is such a delightful restaurant. The atmosphere isn't too lively but it isn't too dull. Tons of families, friends and large groups filled the interior so PCG really suits any age demographic.

Love the atmosphere.\n\nOne of my all-time favorite meals was at the PCG, well over a year ago, and I can't get it out of my head.  It was spicy grilled white fish served on andouille and potato hash over grilled sweet corn puree.  The fish was perfectly cooked - steaming hot on the outside and just set up inside, very moist.  The sweet corn and spicy sausage were awesome together, the meal was just incredible.  My friends were envious - I shared a few small bites :)\n\nMy red meat friends praise the steaks and lamb, I love their seafood entrees and the sauteed veggies.

A month ago, I took out-of-town guests for Sunday brunch. Part of the reason I chose City Grille was because they had a promotion where you could get a free appetizer for checking in on a Smart phone. All you had to do was show your server. Well, my server, no matter how nicely I approached the matter, kept insisting that deal was only for people who brought a print-out of an email--even after I showed her on my phone what their own restaurant\'s Facebook page stated! She just shrugged and said "Well nobody explained it to me." I don\'t fault her if nobody told her. But I do fault her for not even bothering to say anything like, "I don\'t know anything about that but let me go check with a manager" after I showed proof. It wasn\'t even the appetizer but the principle of the matter.\n\nI left a comment on the restaurant\'s Facebook page--very diplomatic, not with any self-entitled overtones. Their social media person asked me to email him directly outlining what happened. Less than two days later, he wrote me, with the owner copied in, apologizing and offering to send me a gift certificate for dinner for two! \n\nThis update is not to say "Woohoo! I got a free meal." It\'s just an appreciation for when a restaurant is willing to own up to a mistake and try to make up for it. It also sounds like because of me, they will remember to make sure all servers are aware of promotions like that. And when I did go back for my free meal, that same server was there, lol.

I got there 30 minutes early and decided to have a happy hour drink at the bar. Well.... their definition of well drink is a little different than most places, for example, they do not offer a well margarita.....pretty odd. The bartender was terse and I did not care for him. Anyway, as my family arrived we decided to sit down. We had made a reservation through open table and they accommodated our party of 12, so that is a positive. The food was good, not amazing, but solid. My family is big into sharing so I got to try the beef tenderloin (good and came with a tasty chipotle potato), the chicken special (chicken with green chile and really good goat cheese polenta), the pork tenderloin (this was maybe the best thing, it had a really flavorful sauce and horseradish mashed potatoes), and the ribs (flavorful, but a little drier than I prefer). We also split Caesar salads which were tasty, they had very well seasoned croutons. The service was good considering our large party size and it was an enjoyable place to have a large party.\n\n I kind of think of it in terms of a wedding....a lot of wedding food isn't amazing but it works because it works for big groups....I think this place is like that.

Spoke with Sheldon beforehand to reserve the private dining room for "20-25" people.  After some hesitation on his part, he agreed to not requiring a set menu, and I agreed that my party would be patient with the service (which did not end up being a problem at all).  He also did not require a deposit, which was fantastic.\n\nI got there later than I wanted to, as I wanted to arrive a little before my reservation, but I got there exactly at 7:00 p.m.  After saying hello to some friends who had already arrived and were waiting in the bar, our table in the private dining room was ready after just a few moments.  We went in and began sitting down - the private dining room is off to the side of the restaurant (beyond the bar area) and was great for our party of 20.  There is a men\'s and women\'s restroom at the end of the dining room which was great as well, and the tables were organized well enough that it felt like we were eating at a single grand dining table.\n\nService was very good, especially considering the amount of people we had and that they were willing to do separate checks.  After getting our drinks ordered and delivered (which took about half an hour), we ordered. \n\nFor appetizers, the table had the hummus, but a few others ordered the green chile queso (very unique and good), the fried eggplant bites (I was hesitant about the goat cheese as I\'m not a big fan, but there is not that much and it just enhance the flavors of the whole dish, which was good), and the bacon-wrapped shrimp (YUM).  All of it was good.\n\nPersonally, I also had a cup of the black bean soup (very good, especially if you cannot get enough black beans like myself).  My entree was the surf n\' turf pasta, which was really flavorful.  You get two shrimps, which were decent sized, and two medallions of beef, which were cooked well but not overdone.  The fettucine was not al dente but still had a good texture, and the sauce was not buttery/overwhelming.  Everything felt/tasted complimentary, which was a good thing!\n\nWe finished things off with their version of chocolate cake, and they had a pumpkin cheesecake which was interesting, but I would have preferred regular cheesecake.  \n\nAnyways, I wanted to thank the staff here for a great birthday dinner.  Everything tasted great, the service was good and prompt (I don\'t believe there was a single issue, which is amazing considering they had 20 people all ordering something totally different, without a set menu), and we all had a great time.  We got started a little after 7:00, and we were done a little before 9:40 (from what I can remember).  For 20 people all ordering drinks and food, that was some efficient service!\n\nI would definitely recommend PCG for a big dining party.  They were courteous, professional, and accomodating.

We arrived around 8:30pm and the place seemed pretty busy with an older crowd. I think we were probably the youngest people in there. Old people know where good food is :) The patio seating might get a bit old with people walking in-between tables so we opted for something inside.\n\nThe atmosphere was dark but yet inviting. We were greeted by a smiling hostest and seated as soon as we walked in. Our waitress came around quickly and gave us water and we had just the right amount of time to decide we would try the Crispy Eggplant bites for an appetizer and Baby Back ribs for me with a twice baked potato rather than fries and my bf's Grilled Pork Tenderloin. \n\nHaving never had fried eggplant I envisioned almost chip like wedges of eggplant but these were more like patties. And OMG were they good! There were only 3 and we definitely fought over the last one and savored every bite!\n\nI'm not usually a girl who orders ribs but these were definitely good. The sauce was unique, a little smokey but not too much but they had really good flavor. The coleslaw was really good, reminded me of KFC with a small punch of ginger and the twice baked potato put a smile on my face. Totally not on the diet but I didn't care. My bf was really happy with his pork tenderloin and the small piece I had was really good. He continued to comment throughout the meal how good it was so I know he liked it a lot.\n\nTo further ruin my diet, we ordered the warm chocolate torte. It was good but one of those really strong, flour-less bunt cakes and they usually aren't my favorite.\n\nOverall, between the atmosphere, food and service, this is definitely a place we will come back to!", 'business_id': 'Pfb6VOIiroqDWOebfgWGPQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2013-04-24', 'type': 'review'}

Although a Norm *does* frequent this joint I\'d rather come here ANY day over the tv version. This place is swank! (Sorry friends. Your description needs tweaking.)\n\nI met my friends at the bar area. I parked out back and walked in via the kitchen area. I did NOT, however, realize I would be walking through a full on kitchen. NOPE. I closed the door in confusion. Double-checked the sign outside that said, "Enter Here" and proceeded. A very understanding employee provided me "directions" to the bar. \n\nThe bar zig zags around to the hostess stand. This is nice so everyone is not lined up like soldiers and conversations flows. There are standing height tables in the bar area as well. The restaurant section has booths (noted on the way to the bathroom) and copious seating. There is also a private room for events behind the elegant wall of wine.\n\nUsing the company\'s weekly email we scored a free appetizer. The "Red chile pork tacos" come two to a plate and are divine. Grilled pork tenderloin w/chipotle aioli & pineapple fennel salsa. YUM.\n\nHaving had a late lunch I could not possibly justify a decadent dinner. But I desperately wanted to after the tacos. Alas, no. Instead, I enjoyed a mouthwatering cup of the daily soup (Friday is the chicken tortilla). \n\nThe group shared something called "Crispy Eggplant Bites". \n\nGoodness!\nRed pepper relish, goat cheese, arugula and a sherry vinaigrette are layered over a crispy heavenly crunchy shell. What this heaven is made of I should have asked. But no, I was too busy inhaling to inquire. (Four to a plate. Big enough for a group to share. IMO. However, I could see a tipsy person opting not to. This stuff is seriously good!)\n\nI also fork sampled my neighbor\'s plate "The Original Griddled Corn Cakes". This is a neat mixture of sweet, spice and well, cheese. And I like cheese!\n\nI\'d say I\'d come back and eat these things again. But NO. I want to try different things *next* time. Brunch looks a-m-a-z-i-n-g. So does lunch. And all the great entrees I had to pass on. (Aww man!)\n\nWith a full belly I understood the "Cheers" reference. You come here repeatedly. \n\nIf you sit in the bar area look for Jose, JP & David. All three bartenders seamlessly moved between guests without missing a beat. Our glasses were never empty.  Even though we were waited on by all three of them service was transparent.\n\nOh! And keep an eye out for the owner, Sheldon. He\'s making the rounds and greeting guests too!\n\nThis place is super popular for good reason.

My husband and I have been to Phoenix City Grille twice before.  It's really great.  They have a wonderful happy hour and we went for brunch on Easter of last year when our first place brought out a plate of food that had gum on the plate.  (Rule #1 - Never put your gum on the plate.  It doesn't wash off or scrape off that easily. You are a lowly human being if you put your gum on your plate or linen napkin.  Use a disposable napkin or tissue.  Karma will pay back the people who leave gum on plates.)  \n\nOur first two trip to Phoenix City Grille were great.  Friendly staff, delicious food, reasonably priced, and truly great happy hour.  This past visit left a lot to be desired.  Our server was friendly enough, (I believe her name was Sonya).  We ordered our drinks which she brought out quickly.  We ordered our food, and then waited.  The table next to us that was sat after us got there food first.  Not that big of a deal.  Then we asked for some cornbread.  Both times we were there before it was brought out to the table just a few pieces for my husband and I to enjoy.  We thought it was odd we had to ask for it.  She offered us individual pieces, or a skillet.  We asked or a skillet.  At no point did she mention that a skillet of corn bread was $10.  It wasn't until we got the bill and had to track down a manager that we learned if you order (yes order) the corn bread in individual pieces, then it is free.  However they charge for a skillet. I don't recall seeing anything on the menu that said cornbread in a skillet - $10.  The manager was gracious enough to reverse this over sight, but we did not see our server again for the rest of the time we were at Phoenix City Grille.  Another server, not even the manager who resolved our cornbread issue brought us our check, ran the card, and returned the check for us to sign. \n\nThings happen.  Sonya didn't mention the up charge for whatever reason, we disagreed that we had never had that happen before, and the she vanished.  I was a server for years.  People don't always agree with how a business is run, and it's the job of the front line (the servers and front of the house staff) to inform guest of what things cost wither by having a price on a menu, or by telling them up front.  I'm disappointed that the felt she had to run away from us.

I have been there for happy hour and dinner, but this was my first time for lunch.   I had the PCG pasta, and my friend had the small Bethany Home Salad.   The flavors for my pasta were beyond great.    The chicken consistency was a bit on the soft side.   Was it "real" chicken?    Dunno.   It was good, though.    I just found the consistency strange, as though it was chicken that was, what, retextured??   Notwithstanding that fact, I loved the sun-dried tomatoes and the broccoli along with the pasta.    There were crispy tortilla strips in my friend\'s salad that she didn\'t want so I put it on my pasta.   This is a hint to the restaurant:   Maybe put those strips on the pasta??   The crispness and flavoring of the corn tortilla strips were a nice compliment to the texture and flavoring of the pasta.   If her salad was "small," I hate to see how large the "big" salad is.   I thought it was large enough for a full meal, and she did, too.    She liked her salad.    I tasted it.

I had the special of the evening, seafood linguine with shrimp and crab and lemon capers butter sauce, .   WOW!!   It was great.  In fact, beyond great.    I was trying to figure out how the pasta was flavored with every bite I put in my mouth.  I think I shall call the restaurant and find out.    It was the right mix of ingredients, not too buttery, which would make it oily/greasy.   The right amount of capers, which, if there\'s too many, overpowers the other flavors, and the right mix of barely knowing it also contained lemon.     Oh, yes, he had the Grilled Beef Tenderloin.    Since he is on a "low carb" diet, he asked to exchange the starch for veggies.    I was thinking about having that, but I am more of a seafood, chicken gal versus beef.    I tried it.   It was good, the beef was very tender.    Sorry, can\'t give a review from  just one bite.   My wine was the cab, Sebastiani, Sonoma Black Cherry.    No, I don\'t follow the white with the seafood/chicken "rule."     I like cabs.    It was good.    I shall go back, you can count on it.    I sure would like to have the flavoring mix of the pasta.   I had called the restaurant to find out the name of my dish since it was the special of the night.    I was told it used to be on the menu, and they try to mix it up.    My opinion?

Our bartender/server was David, very professional yet personable. Made sure we were comfortable and served our food promptly despite the restaurant/bar area getting crowded. Will recommend this restaurant to my friends and family. We will definitely be coming back again.

If you are a rep looking to do a dinner training event you have to book this place. They have the private room next to the kitchen - away from the rest of the restaurant so it's fantastically quiet if you are tying to give a presentation to a small group.  No fee for the projector or screen - private bathrooms- personal server and top notch food.  They made us a personalized limited menu but they will also offer full.  Sheldon is the owner and he really set up a great facility - I travel the west looking for decent places to give small dinner presentations (8-20) and it's always too loud or the food is bad.  5 stars all the way for Phoenix city grill", 'business_id': 'Pfb6VOIiroqDWOebfgWGPQ', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2015-10-02', 'type': 'review'}
