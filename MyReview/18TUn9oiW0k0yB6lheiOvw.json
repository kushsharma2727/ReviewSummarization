I added an extra salad for $2.\n\nAll dinners come with salad, choice of potatoes (fried or mashed -- the fried potatoes are chunks of potatoes, deep fried; the mashed are still a bit chunky with white gravy), and a roll and a biscuit.\n\nThe salad is basic -- iceberg lettuce and tomatoes.

The olive is great!\n\nShiner bock is the house beer for $3.25 a bottle, other domestics are $2.75 each and imports are $3.75.\n\nOur dinner, two salads, 2 Coors lights and one JD on the rocks was $29 including the tip.\n\nYee haw!\nY'all come back now, y'hear?!", 'business_id': '18TUn9oiW0k0yB6lheiOvw', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2007-02-18', 'type': 'review'}

When we heard that our favorite Texan restaurant serves it only on Tuesday nights, we had to make the trip.\n\nWe arrived after 9pm but luckily they still had one order left.   $11 for five giant beef back ribs - slow-smoked over hickory and oak, topped with a homemade BBQ sauce and served with their rustic mashed potatoes. \n\nThe dry spice-rub had so infused into the meat during the long slow cooking process that we didn't need the sauce.  Eating beef ribs is a carnivorous act - almost caveman like - if it wasn't for the fact that the server thoughtfully brought us a warm wet napkin to wipe our saucy fingers on.\n\nDespite the tastiness of the ribs, there was just so much of it that even with the two of us sharing, we could not finish it.

My partner loves some of that! I really shouldn't eat it and it's where?\nClose to home. How much do we have to pay for it? $7 maybe less.  Really? \n\nThe place does look divey and we might not have tried it without Yelp. Got a parking place right up near the door, sauntered into the Texaz . Noted the armadillos and horned toads scaling the ceiling, the hats, the bric a brac, the country music, the beer signs. More condiments on the table than I'm used to. Lea and Perrins, Heinz 57 Steak Sauce, A-1, Ketchup, mustard, Tabasco, another hot sauce, jar of chili's, Sugar pourer, salt, pepper, and a caddy of pink sugar packets. \n\nThe waitress was right on cue, with menu and kid menu, a cup of crayons and no rush. Drinks came immediately. We ordered some chili frito's (in the bag) a chicken fried chicken, a chicken fried steak and a pork chop all with mashed potatoes, corn and white gravy and totally tasty biscuit.  Frito-bag chili came out first and was yummy, we all shared. Dinner came just as our bag o' chili was gone. It was hot and ready. My partner absolutely loved the gigantic chicken fried steak, my chicken was moist and all white meat juicy. The corn had that roasted buttery flavor I adore. The drinks never languished. The server was always available but never invading our space. Pacing and food and price couldn't be beat. Those were very good mashed potatoes! No one had any leftovers to take home. My daughter even ate almost every bite and she had ordered an adult meal!\n\nIt was too late when I noticed the oyster po'boy special... shoot! I'll have to come back. And then I'll have to come back again because with three steak sauce choices maybe I should have bought a steak? There is an ad on the table that they serve the cheapest steak for your money. I have to know if it's tasty and not just cheap.\n\nCouldn't leave without  a dessert. We also couldn't pick between pecan pie and bread pudding so we left it up to our server. She brought us out  a 3 1/2 inch square of very hot sweet, drenched in sauce bread pudding. Very Yummy!\n\nOur bill was light and our tummies were heavy and we left with a five star feeling. However I had to remove a star because an hour after we ate we both suffered some gastric distress and frequent visits to our private bathroom. I still will return, because it can happen anywhere and there was a lot of dairy in that gravy and in the potatoes, so it's partly our fault, but I had to mention it to be fair in the review.\n\nStill...If what you are seeking is down home food, not counting the calories or concerned about the cholesterol, just come on in and eat it up! It's some tasty Texaz.\n\nUpdate: Went for dinner this time, and the service wasn't near as good, prices were much higher than food value and as such it wasn't worth the bill price. We know now that you should order the specials, those are generally good deals and come at lunch. The mashed potato was still stellar but the gravy was too thick to move. My Prime Rib was +30% fat and that left me with a much smaller portion than I expected. My partners steak DID need the steak sauces, so it's not that they have fabulous NY strip. Docked one star off my original 4 star rating.

They were still tasty, and being a girl that is used to smoked meats around the house, I kind of enjoyed eating the semi-dry little discs. I tossed aside the top half of the po boy bun, and just ate the meat with the sauce soaked bottom half of the bun. The sauce was dark, with a smoky sweet flavor. The coleslaw was creamy and the cabbage was finely chopped. The Texaz potatos are chunks of seasoned, and fried potatos. I only ate about 3 or 4 before I was stuffed. \n\nAs is always the case with Texaz Grill, I wasn\'t overly delighted, but I wasn\'t overly disappointed.

I\'ve done my share of traveling and I\'ve lived in other places. Being new to the Phoenix area, naturally I\'m always looking for comforts that remind me of Texas. I\'ll often be seen wearing my Longhorns or Astros caps.\n\nI love food! I love Tex-Mex, BBQ and southern style cookin\'. So I passed the Texaz Grill several times before I had an opportunity to stop in. The first time I ever stumbled upon it, I got so excited because of the name and the neon signs adorning the windows, Shiner Baby!\n\nWhen I did stop in, I was in awe, not because it felt like home but because of all the things hanging on the ceiling and the walls and because of the neons inside. Everything in this place has something to do with Texas. Sweet! And they sell Shiner Bock beer!\n\nI knocked off a couple stars because of pricing, variety and the service we got. We were seated promptly but it was pretty much downhill after that. I looked over the menu, which took about a half minute, and was shocked that they didn\'t even have a hamburger on it. I\'d say don\'t go here unless you\'re supa dupa hungry because you\'re going to have to order a steak of some sort or fish or maybe pork chops (I don\'t remember). I wasn\'t starving, that\'s my point. And I\'m not even a fan of chicken fried steak but I know a good one when I eat one and it\'s definitely a true test of a "Texas" style restaurant. So I order the chicken fried steak. It was very good, just what you would find at your favorite down home restaurant anywhere in Texas. It came with what they call steak fries, but they were really just big cubes of potatoes. I thought they were kinda weird and bland. You get a large portion of food, very large actually. But it seemed a bit steep, maybe I\'m just cheap. Either way, I did enjoy a bottle of Shiner and the place was decent and novel enough that I will go back, if for no other reason than to sit at the bar and have a beverage. Maybe I\'ll run into some fellow Texans and I can share with them my wonderful experiences in this great city of Phoenix.', 'business_id': '18TUn9oiW0k0yB6lheiOvw', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2008-12-11', 'type': 'review'}

We were sat in a large booth, 8 adults, one toddler, and a newborn baby. \n\nEven though we were in a large booth, it was still a tight fit, also, the carrier (with the baby in it) was on the floor most of the time, until they brought us a chair to put the carrier on.\n\nThe atmosphere of this place is LOUD. Not just music, but people talking loudly as well. The walls beyond covered in "stuff", things like dollar bills, stuffed dead animals, panties, pictures, license plates, I guess the closest thing you could guess in theme would be "trailer park". \n\nThe waitress was not accommodating to the noise, and spoke mostly in a whisper. She spent most of the time looking annoyed, speaking in a low voice that we could barely hear, and acting spastic (not taking our orders in an orderly way, bringing some food but not all that we had ordered, refilling some drinks but not others, etc). \n\nI ordered the Prime Rib, rare, with mashed potatoes. It came with a side salad consisting of iceberg lettuce, diced tomatoes, and minced green olives. An odd combination. The prime rib was overly marinated in "smoke flavor" and had more flavor reminiscent of ham than of prime rib. It was a good portion. The mashed potatoes were dry and partially cold, not very flavorful. I requested no gravy, yet my mashed potatoes still had that dip in them where you would normally put gravy, meaning I had a very small portion of mashed potatoes (that you probably don\'t notice when you get gravy). \n\nMy girlfriend had the same thing I did but medium instead of rare like I did, everyone else in the party had the chicken fried steak. My girlfriend was as disappointed in her food as I was. Everyone who ordered chicken fried steak loved it. It really is a giant portion, two, three servings really. Most everyone took some of theirs home. Though the two people from texas said it wasn\'t the best chicken fried steak they\'d ever had, and I\'d take that recommendation into consideration. Texas people know their chicken fried steak. \n\nFor dessert my girlfriend and I shared the peach cobbler. This menu description is inaccurate, its more akin to yellow cake with peach filling. Tasty, but not what we expected. They do use blue bunny ice cream though, which is awesome. \n\nAbout an hour after dinner my girlfriend and I both felt a little sick from dinner.

Vegan? Bringing a baby carrier? Then you should probably stay home. Yes, it\'s a dive in an aging strip mall at 16th and Bethany. Yes, there is lots of junk hanging from the ceiling and walls that a few won\'t appreciate as low-brow Texas ambiance. And yes, the portions tend to be on the "enormous" side so if you\'re watching your waistline, plan on splitting a meal. \n\nBut rest assured the place is a Phoenix icon and will be \'til way after you\'re gone. It is texas-style comfort food - nice and simple. The steaks are great - they cut and age their own like a real steakhouse. The prime rib, when you arrive early enough, is superb - and shockingly cheap considering the cut. And I doubt you\'d find a better, more authentic texas-style chicken fried steak (and chicken fried chicken) anywhere in town. So big you\'ll want to share - or take 1/2 home. But is is goooood.\n\nIf you\'re a newbie to Texas Grill - it\'s good to know that probably 90% of the clientele are regulars and are likely close personal friends to the staff of many years. This tip is helpful so that you don\'t get lynched by the surrounding tables for dissing the busy waitress because your water glass gets low. Come to Texaz in a good mood and ready to eat and you\'ll be fine. In time the staff may take a cotton to you too - but you\'ll have to earn it.\n\nThere\'s not a mistake on the menu. One great value is to order the chop steak as a burger (it\'s not on the menu) and you\'ll have one of the best burgers in town. If you\'re a party of one or there\'s a few open seats - belly up to the bar. Tammy and Cindy are the usual evening bartenders and they serve one of the best margaritas in town - on the rocks (only) and with salt of course. The selection at the bar is simple and basic, but you\'ll be entertained all night trying to read decades of bumper stickers and fridge magnets. You may even meet a few new friends as the regulars are a friendly bunch (especially after a marg or two).\n\nWhen visitors come to town, you can bet Texaz is always in the mix. Sure we hit Scottsdale for glam, downtown for urban cool, and Barrio or Richardsons for nuevo mexican - but for a fun evening with friends plus good comfort food, you can\'t beat Texaz.

I could have sworn my booth was going to fall apart, but it was ok.  The d\xe9cor is a bit eccentric with anything and everything having to do with Texas all over the walls.

Next time I am going to order the prime rib or the chicken friend steak because I hear those are excellent.  My salad came quickly and was very good.  However, it was a bit odd because it contained diced green olives (which I normally don't like), but I said what the heck and ate it all anyway.  I was pleasantly surprised.  When the steak arrived I was surprised again at the size.  I was expecting it to be much smaller but it was a pretty big cut.  I'm guessing around 8-10oz.  I love it when steaks are cooked in plenty of butter (gross to some people...I know) and I guess this place knew that because there was plenty of the hot, melty goodness all over the steak and plate!  It was soooo good but soooo unhealthy.  It was cooked perfectly and I ate every bite.  The potatoes were just ok but I ate them anyway.  Nothing a bunch of salt and ketchup couldn't fix.

That being said, I like to see my man happy - a knife in one hand, a fork in the other, and a big plate of Western goodness between the two. \n\nTEXAZ seemed perfect. I read reviews, (not on Yelp, unfortunately), scoped out the location, and surprised him by taking him there a few months ago. \n\nI, for one, loved the atmosphere.

This is the most overrated place I\'ve been to in a while. \n\nI\'d never been to TexAZ before today because I always seem to crave chicken fried steak for breakfast, and the place doesn\'t open until 11:00 a.m. Well, today I was craving chicken fried steak for lunch, so I thought I\'d try out TexAZ out. \n\nThe size of the chicken fried steak is enormous, there\'s no denying that; but that\'s where the goodness ends. Sometimes quantity has a quality all its own, but not here. Let\'s face it: chicken fried steak is a vehicle for gravy. Even though the TexAZ steak was big enough to feed four hungry lumberjacks, they really skimped on the gravy. Even worse, both the gravy and the steak were bland, without a hint of identifiable spice. I kept eying the numerous condiments on the table while wondering if maybe adding them to the meal would make it easier to eat. The sides that accompanied the meal let me down too. The biscuit is more like a roll, and didn\'t flake as a biscuit should; the corn seemed like it might have come right out of a can; and I don\'t remember much about my mashed potatoes. \n\nIn summary: "Meh. I\'ve experienced better." In fact, I enjoy the chicken fried steak at the JB\'s on 19th Ave. and Missouri more than the one here. I won\'t be returning.', 'business_id': '18TUn9oiW0k0yB6lheiOvw', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2009-09-15', 'type': 'review'}

The breading's texture is great with a nice crunch. The steak is very tender and not dry. My only complaint would be that the food is BLAND! The breading definitely could've used some flavor or spice and so did the gravy. Odd that the steak is such huge portion but the gravy is very much skimped on. I liked it, but it definitely could use some major seasoning. Maybe they can steal it from Chili's. Even though Chili's is a chain, they have one of the best chicken fried steak I've had.

This was probably why I wasn't insanely impressed. The steak itself was pretty good, but the gravy wasn't what I expected at all. I've been spoiled in the past with overwhelmingly flavorful sausage gravy with biscuits, and that's what I was expecting. So be warned if you're expecting something similar to that. But, again mentioning portions, that was the biggest chicken fried steak that I've ever had.\n\nFried okra, a dinner salad and their red chili were also chosen off the menu that night. The okra was pretty good, just battered and deep fried, and served with some sort of sauce (I didn't examine it well enough to say what it was). The salads were pretty good, but go for the vinaigrette because the ranch was sort of bland. Oh, and be prepared for a lot of dressing. Lastly, the chili...it was served the proper way with cheese and onions, which was nice, but I wasn't blown away with the flavor of this either. In all honesty, it seemed like they meant to cook it with MGD, but didn't cook all of the alcohol out...it was essentially beer flavored chili.\n\nI'm going to go back to TEXAZ for sure (waitress was pretty sweet by the way), but I think my next visit will be for lunch. Some of their sandwiches look fantastic, and I'm really hoping to become a big fan of TEXAZ after trying some of them.", 'business_id': '18TUn9oiW0k0yB6lheiOvw', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2010-10-27', 'type': 'review'}

Think I Would Rather Suck Down Your Colonoscopy Bag?\n\nIf you are truly looking for a unique dining experience accompanied with old world business cards and lifeless animals, then you will need to try out Texaz Grill all for yourself. If you are looking for good food, solid service, and a nice atmosphere, then you probably want to avoid this strip mall hangout at all costs. If you love low-quality food, poor service, and a revolting atmosphere, then you need to steer your lifted F350 right on over to Texaz Grill.\n\nWow, from the moment we walked in I knew we were in for trouble ... I just didn't think it could be as bad as it actually was. This is one establishment that will leave you wondering whether the city of Phoenix mandates any sort of cleanliness or health standards. This place is dirty, vile, unkempt, and this is way before we even met our server or received our food.\n\nJust 7:30 PM on a Thursday night, but you would have thought this place was closing up shop for the night or permanently (which wouldn't be a bad thing). Guests are sparse and the few who do remain look like they have chain smoked all of taste buds right out of their mouths. The servers give you the impression they are NOT working for tips and really make no attempt at ensuring a pleasant guest experience. The inside will remind you of a cross between a real, small town BBQ joint and a TGIFridays minus the corporate cleanliness standards. The booths are ancient, uncomfortable, and anything but clean. The walls are littered with business cards, dead animals, used hats, and license plate frames. You will want to write off all the dirt and disaster on the wall as good old Texas charm, but you will quickly realize your appetite fades as each minute passes you by.\n\nSo we arrive at our booth and are quickly greeted by our degenerate server who you would have thought was being paid by number of tables she turned over per night. She doesn't look like she wants to be there, and, frankly, neither do we. Our drinks are brought out in a timely fashion, and then she did the best she could to get us to order a quickly as possible. And, we're off....\n\nOrders are put in for a Chicken Fried Steak and the Thursday night BBQ sampler. Our server had to check that there were any of the BBQ samplers left which should tell you that this combination was probably made yesterday and has been hanging around all day. The salad came quick - too quick. Within two minutes of ordering, I had the misfortune of choking down a brown, bland, and boring salad. Of course, nobody goes to a BBQ joint for a salad, but I think most prefer green lettuce and more than two dressing choices.  Not even ten minutes later and our entrees had arrived, and we suddenly had enough food to feed an entire homeless shelter but I have my doubts of them even touching this piss poor attempt at Texas BBQ.\n\nChicken Fried Steak - imagine about 1oz of beef shankle meat breaded in a pound of breading and smothered in some alien gravy. The meat was bland, veiny, chewy, and not even good enough for my neighbor's dog. You get two of them and each one will be bigger than your head, but I'm not really sure what you are supposed to do with them because they are anything but edible.\n\nBBQ Sampler - I would have rather have sampled what was soaked up in the dirty bar rag or growing out of the rug. The ribs were too fatty and smothered in the generic BBQ sauce that made this place famous. The brisket was boring and overcooked. The Texas fries were not fries, nor were they good. The sausage was edible, but more so in a comparative way. Even the bread was terrible.\n \nThe food can be summed up as atrocious, inedible, poor quality, and even hard to look at. Truly some of the worst food I have ever eaten or looked at in my entire life. The highlight of the night was easily when our server seemed astonished we refused the to-go box. Sorry, but you should have been shaking our hands for even trying to make a meal out of those make-me-want-to-go-vegetarian plates of meat. \n\nIt is worth mentioning that Texas Grill does two things and two things only correctly. You will be seated quickly to ensure that the dead animals or the plethora of 1970s business cards stapled to the walls don't scare you away and the plastic soft drink mugs are gigantic, but I'm sure this was implemented to minimize server interaction with the tables.\n\nGo grab a McRib or two before you throw away any money at this place...or be ready to pop some serious laxatives. Outside of some rough drinking nights, I have never felt the urge to vomit all over the place 15 hours after a meal. Good luck to you if you choose this place. If you do decide to go, don't forget to bring your business card - it might be old enough to go up on the wall in 2032 - that is, assuming this place is around much longer.", 'business_id': '18TUn9oiW0k0yB6lheiOvw', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2010-11-29', 'type': 'review'}

I think we went on a Thurs night and they had dinner chicken and dumplings ($10) for one of the daily specials.

The meat was not the only thing unseasoned, the chicken tenders, potatoes, biscuits and pretty much everything else was tasteless and so bad I couldn't eat it and I LOOOOVE anything fried, so this is pretty bad. We actually felt kind of bad for them when they saw how much food was on the table and we didn't want a take home box.   \n\nI advise they add salt & pepper at the least.", 'business_id': '18TUn9oiW0k0yB6lheiOvw', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2011-06-13', 'type': 'review'}

Then this is your place!\n\nNow, you go in, and ahh the ambiance, shit on the walls as far as the eye can see, oh and not just the walls, the ceiling as well! Its jam packed, you can\'t hear the person in front of you, you\'re thinking, when\'s the last time they dusted all this crap? How much falls in my food from the lazy ceiling fans. \n\nIts hot and a bit humid to, maybe to recreate that true texas experience?\n\nSo you order your tbone, medium rare, side of mashed potatoes and hell, some okra while you\'re at it. Good okra is hard to find in these parts.\n\nThe okra, crispy, soft inside (once its done being molten lava), perfect. Don\'t bother with the sauce unless your garnish for okra is tartar sauce.\n\nHey, a side salad come with it! Oh, the tiny diced tomatoes, ice burg lettuce, and what an interesting mix, diced green olives all over the top, in giant piles.\n\nNow your entree comes, but the waitress, if you\'re lucky, has worked there 4 years! Shes got a blond dye job, too much eye makeup, and a perm. She makes sure to leave every single dish on the table, just in case you missed one delicious crumb. At some point she might drop by one basket of rolls, for a table of 8. The buttermilk ones taste homemade, not bad!\n\nOh yes, the entree, a tbone, super thin, in what is that? Its pooling everywhere, oh god the grease. You did order your steak with a large slathering of grease right? Well those mashed potatoes, which are thick and standard, are drenched in heavy white gravy, and all the blandness of the gravy helps soak up all that grease!\n\nSo you\'re almost done with your food, omg, your giant glass is empty? Where was that waitress? Oh don\'t worry, just grab her by the arm and she\'ll try to remember to refill your drink. And those extra plates, well if they\'re really bothering you you can ask a bus person to take them, though you might as well be asking them to lick your shoe (or eat what you just did). \n\nNow you\'re full, you\'ve paid, and because of its "prime" location, you get to cross a busy intersection to get to the car you had to park across the street. \n\nMight as well just wait to get home to pee too, its sweltering in there, more crap on the walls and ceiling, and you pretty much have to stand on the toilet to get the stall door closed.', 'business_id': '18TUn9oiW0k0yB6lheiOvw', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2011-06-20', 'type': 'review'}

Wasn't really fresh..had a lot of ranch on it, but I can see how somebody might like it. Ate some of it and pushed it to the side.\n\nSoon our steak arrived. I was so excited to try it! I took my first bite and was shocked to find that it was completely bland. I added some salt and ate some more. The meat wasn't the best, which I understand because it's chicken fried steak, however it tasted frozen to me. After the 4th bite, I had to ask my husband if it tasted the same as before. He shook his head no and commented on how disguising it was. Even the mashed potatoes were bland. I agreed and started to feel gross thinking about eating any more of it.  \n\nWe both pushed out dishes to the side, with lots of food still left on our plate. When our waitress came by about 10 minutes after she dropped the food off, we told her we were done. She asked if we wanted a box, which we declined, but otherwise no questions or concerns - she didn't even seem to notice that we ate almost nothing off of our plates. Didn't feel like bringing it up at the time, so we just paid our $35 for and left.

Best dessert--the bread pudding.\n\nWhile the chicken fried steak used to be our favorite non-plain-steak entree--we have recently converted to the fried chicken.  It is very good. \nWith both "chicken fried" dishes,  the left-over reheating capability is pretty important since you get SO MUCH food...so the chicken wins out on this one..the Chicken reheats much better than the chicken fried steak.  \n\nThe atmosphere is...well...it is UNIQUE...and isn\'t that what you want in your local saloon/steak house.  :0)  The service is equally as local/quirky.  We consider it ambiance and character. I don\'t think we have ever wanted for beverages in all of the times we have been there, as a note.  \n\nParking can be a bit challenging on a busy night..but it all adds to the "charm".  \n\nWe have likely been to Tex Az about 25 times over the years.

I\'m a bigger guy, i like fattening food, but that was just gross to me. my girlfriends food wasn\'t that much better. \n\nwhen the bill came around, it was 48 bucks, which is what i left with no tip because the service was equally terrible, she was rude and acted like she wanted us gone. i have NEVER not left a tip. \n\ni know this place has a great reputation, and that\'s what got me in there, but when i left i was honestly impressed by how bad that was. i almost want to call my friend that suggested this place to me and tell him he owes me 50 bucks. \n\nnot worth it, never coming back here again.', 'business_id': '18TUn9oiW0k0yB6lheiOvw', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2013-05-17', 'type': 'review'}

We have been here twice and both times were excellent. The first time around I ordered the chicken fried steak and it was flavorful not to mention massive. This last time I decided to change things up and get the catfish, and I have to say this was easily the best catfish I\'ve gotten from a restaurant, it is perfectly seasoned and melts in your mouth. Catfish isn\'t my favorite fish and far too many places can\'t make it properly, the sweetness of the catfish almost overpowers things. Not here, the flavor of the breading and the work in harmony. I will definitely get catfish again here! Oh yeah, their Texas Potatoes (or whatever they are called) are good as well, basically they are potato chunks that are fried, in fact I am willing to bet they double fry them to give the outerlayer a crispy texture. \n\nThe restaurant itself resembles your typical small town restaurant, and that is fine with me since I grew up with restaurants like it. Their walls are covered with pictures, posters, signs and whatever else they can put up on it, it gives it an unique look. If you want a "nice" restaurant then you better look elsewhere, but if you want a hometown family restaurant and bar setting this is your place.\n\nService is fantastic as well, our server was constantly refilling our drinks and extremely friendly. One nice aspect of this place is that they give you large glasses for your beverage, so you usually only need a refill or two, we had a bit more because we were recovering from the summer heat.  Also for the record they carry Pepsi products, which is a bonus for me, but may not be for others.\n\nIn regards to price, they aren\'t cheap (the chicken fried steak is around 13 and the catfish for two big filets was around 12), but you will have more then enough food so it works out in the long run. \n\nOverall a great small town style restaurant and bar if you are looking for a hearty meal that is made right.', 'business_id': '18TUn9oiW0k0yB6lheiOvw', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2013-06-03', 'type': 'review'}

Next, I came with my husband and two year old daughter and the hostess told me that they don\'t have a high chair that can accommodate a two year old so she had to use a booster seat.  The problem is that she\'s at that middle age where she\'s almost done with high chairs and still too immature for a booster seat.  What a mess trying to keep her in her booster seat and contained.  She wasn\'t noisy or badly behaved, per se, she just wanted to stand up in the booth and look around and fidget with all the condiment bottles on the table.  Also, can I mention that the booths have a weird half wall that obscures the other diners from the chest up, but is open from the chest level down, so someone in the other booth could easily reach underneath the wall and dig around in your purse if they wanted to, or your two year old can peek underneath the booth wall to play peek-a-boo with the diners on the other side?  It\'s pretty weird.\n\nSo the waitress came over took our drink orders with a minimum of small talk (or overall friendliness).  We perused the menus.  My husband chose a beef brisket sandwich.  I wanted a t-bone steak, I had been craving one and I was looking forward to it.  We ordered our dinners and it\'s worth mentioning that at NO point did the waitress acknowledge that presence of our daughter.  She never asked us what she wanted to eat or if she needed anything to drink either, apparently she was invisible.  Seeing as how there weren\'t any kids meals on the menu, I just assumed we\'d feed her from our own plates, but interestingly the waitress just assumed that too because she didn\'t even ask if she\'d be having a side order of something as her meal,  She just looked right past her.  If I sound pissed it\'s because I was.  I don\'t need the waitress to pinch her cheeks and make baby talk with her, but to merely acknowledge the fact that there were three human beings sitting at the booth that night would have been covered in \'Basic Manners 101\'.\n\nSo my steak was very flavorful and tender but BADLY undercooked, terribly fatty and a sickly color gray.  (It didn\'t have a nice sear or a good caramel color to it.)  I ordered it medium rare, but instead I got bloody, almost blue meat.  And there was so much fat that I only got about half meat, the rest was all scrap fat and the bone.  My sides were non-descript.  I think my mashed potatoes were probably decent, I honestly can\'t even remember that\'s how non-descript they were.  The roll and bread \'basket\' that came with my food (one little roll and one little cold biscuit) were hard and tasted store bought.  And my hungry toddler didn\'t even want them.  My husband\'s beef brisket sandwich was a pathetic, dried out, flavorless waste of good money.  We didn\'t even bother with desserts.\n\nI had a margarita; it was very good, but beguilingly strong for how petite the rock glass is that it was served in.  After I finished it the waitress came around and asked me if I wanted another and I declined, but my husband (a non-drinker) immediately piped up and said "Yes, she\'ll have another!" and shot me a playful look, and rather than looking to me so see if I *really* wanted another $7 margarita or not she simply walked away and had the bartender make me another one!  WTF?  So within a couple of minutes I had yet another very, very strong margarita sitting in front of me.  Now I\'m no cheapskate but I don\'t like to waste money so I choked down that second margarita and it was the proverbial \'straw that broke the camel\'s back\'.  I may have finished it, but it definitely finished ME.  I spent the rest of the night stumbling and mumbling to myself about someone slipping me a mickey.  I\'ve never, ever had a margarita that strong and I am a very well seasoned drinker.   What of Earth did they put in them??\n\nSo to sum it up I spent over $60 (includes the tip) for 2 small Molotov cocktails disguised as margaritas, an undercooked, fatty, t-bone steak, an inedible, dry beef brisket sandwich and a big serving of NOTHING for my child.  \n\nNever again.\n\nThe two stars are for the flavor and tenderness of the otherwise failure of a steak and the extreme value for your money on the alcohol.  THAT\'S IT.', 'business_id': '18TUn9oiW0k0yB6lheiOvw', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2013-07-09', 'type': 'review'}

I would not recommend this place to anyone.', 'business_id': '18TUn9oiW0k0yB6lheiOvw', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2013-12-31', 'type': 'review'}

Just standing abruptly in utter fascination, usually in the middle of the sidewalk, blocking commutes in Times Square. In the office we would chalk it up to visual overload. \n\nSo when I walked into TEXAZ Grill and behaved similarly I laughed at myself. Opening the doors to this restaurant was unbelievable. Memorabilia from the Great State of Texas. Covers. Every. Square. Inch.  \n\nNeon lights greeted me.  "Texas!" (Also neon shapes of Texas were everywhere.) An old school juke box. Beer signs galore. Guitars hanging. A giant gull head. Horns. John Wayne behind the bar. "Happy Birthday Texas!" The best collection of inappropriate stickers *ever*. License plates of every state covered the bar. The collection has been cultivated over 28 years by the the owner and patrons. (Tip: When you go, feel free to bring stuff in!)\n\nAnyhoo, stuff. My eyeballs were full. Finally I made it to the bar and met Tammy. (A hoot who has worked here 18 years!) After inquiring where I was from, a peppy response, "Well, welcome to Texas!" (And so I fell in love with this place. Before food even factored into the equation.)\n\nENTREES\nSo the food... A tad concerned there wouldn\'t be a healthy option to consume I was incredibly wrong. (Plenty of non-fried options!) The ribeye steak was to die for. (Perhaps the mashed potatoes with gravy were necessary to consume. But I just had to try them!) \n\nThe meat was prepared to the exact pinkness level requested. I can\'t even describe the level of food happiness that transpired that night. The meat was just so tender. I had made the mistake of noshing on the spicy hot peanuts available on the bar, as well as eating my way thru the delightfully prepared coleslaw that accompanied the meal.\n\nAmateur hour. Yes, definitely eat the coleslaw. It was flavorful and not too heavy in mayo. (Or try the salad with the blue cheese. Wonderful chunks of cheese.) But leave space for your meal!\n\nAs I wasn\'t dining solo I had the opportunity to sample a burger. Holy bejeebers. This isn\'t a frou frou burger. This is a simply prepared burger, sans grease, on a beautiful bun with high quality meat. \n\nDESSERT\nWe earned a bread pudding! One second and I\'ll explain how. Tough decision as to what to pick but we went with the french bread in an egg custard with toasted pecans & raisins. Why? It was topped with a bourbon sauce! Dense and delicious. Served as described. Warm. Mmm mmm mmm! Biggest scoop of ice cream too!\n\nCLEAN PLATE CLUB\nClean you plate at lunch and get one punch. Two punches for dinner. EIGHT punches equals ONE dessert! How sweet is that? :)\n\nHH\nMon-Thur 3-6pm\n1/2 bottled beer\nWine by the glass\nAll well drinks\n\nAs they say there "It doesn\'t get any better kids!"\n\nWe loved sitting at the bar for dinner!

Now on to the main course, and this is where I have to say we were very disappointed. My husband had the chicken fried steak, and yes it was definitely huge, however there was no flavor to it whatsoever. Even the gravy tasted of flour and not much else. A little seasoning (salt & pepper) would have gone a long way. I had the grilled pork chops and mashed potatoes. The pork chops were a little dry, and again under-seasoned, the mashed potatoes were ok, but I could see what my husband was talking about on the gravy.

I have been enjoying their CFS since they were Lone Star (over 20 years).  \n\nMy wife and I stopped in this past Saturday (03/22/2014) for an early lunch.  We were immediately "greeted and seated".\n\nOur server came by for our drink order and I also ordered a cup of the "Sopa de Fidello" (my main reason for this visit).  The soup came and was very, very good.   I normally get a cup of their wonderful chili, but I really wanted to try this soup after reading the description on line.  I wasn\'t disappointed in the least.  Chunks of ham, vegetables, and the video noodles; all in a spicy, savory broth.  I would love a big bowl of this soup and some wonderful chewy, crusty bread on a cold winters night (yes, I know I\'m in Phoenix, but I can dream...).\n\nBoth my wife and I had a salad w/ the house dressing and the lunch sized Chicken Fried Steak.  I love the house dressing at TEXAZ.  My wife (a former ranch dressing girl) now orders the house dressing, it\'s so good. The salad is evenly coated w/ dressing, and there is never a glob of it on the plate when you\'re done.\n\nWhat can I say about the CFS, that hasn\'t been said many times before...it was perfect as usual.  The CFS came w/ mashed potatoes, corn, and a biscuit.  The steaks were hanging over the sides of the plate.  Fresh, hot and perfectly seasoned.  I have tried this dish at other restaurants, only to be disappointed w/ the food. \n\nI didn\'t get the name of our server, but she was great.  She came and checked on us regularly and was pleasant and quick w/ the tea refills.\n\nYet another great meal at one of my favorite restaurants...\n\nI think there are many restaurants here in the valley that could learn something from TEXAZ and their longevity here in a place known for "here today and gone tomorrow".\nQuality and consistency.

How often does something like that happen?  \n\nService - Our service was top notch!  We each ordered several courses and our server was always on top of drink refills, each order was correct, and we had to ask for nothing as she anticipated what each of us would need.  She was quiet but very thoughtful.\n\nFood - Giant - Texas size portions, great tasting and very reasonably priced, considering our group was mostly teenagers what more could you ask for?  The chicken fried steak is amazing!!!\n\nD\xe9cor/ambience - lots and lots of things on the wall and an infinite amount of Texas kitsch.\n\nI would recommend Texaz for lunch or dinner any day of the week.

I enjoy this place but just can't come here to often. TEXAZ is an unassuming place on the outside and settled in a very tight corner of the shopping center. Like I said very unassuming. Once you walk in then BOOM. It's like a time warp taking you back to Texas in the 1970's. Place is decorated with old pictures related to Texas, road signs, animal heads, caps, and old license places. Very interesting and very loud. Everyone talking, eating, and having a good time. \n\nWe started out with our usual fries okra. This is the only place I can find fried okra in AZ. Nice change of pace. Love the okra. Nice and crisp. Love it. So I ordered their famous Chicken Fried Steak. They say it's the best in AZ and I can't disagree. All meals comes with a side salad. Salad doesn't look that appetizing but it's not bad. House dressing is pretty good. Anyways, the CFS comes with two huge pieces hanging off the plate smothered with gravy and comes with mash potatoes. Very crispy and fresh. Not greasy at all. Really good. Best in AZ hands down. Only problem is that it's too much food. I couldn't even come close to to finishing it. I saw two guys at a table across from us share an order of CFS. Very smart and would probably recommend sharing this huge meal. My wife ordered the Fried Catfish. Two large pieces of fish with a side of mash potatoes. Wife loved it. Not greasy at all. Fresh and moist but again a lot of food. So good. Everyone's ordering the CFS and fried catfish. There's a reason. \n\nMy son ordered the prime rib regular cut. Really big piece of meat with a side of mash potatoes. My son really liked the prime rib. He's a fussy eater and he really like the prime rib. So when he likes it then I know it's really good. Looked juicy and fresh. \n\nWe were stuffed with all this food. Packed up our leftovers but you can't leave this place without dessert. We shared the pecan pie. Oh my gosh. Your probably laughing right now but this is the best pecan pie. Had pecan pie from Texas and all over and this is the best I've had. It had a hard topping that most pecan pies don't have. A little chewy and not as sweet as most pecan pie. Crust is outstanding. Hands down yummy. \n\nSo the food was really really good. The service was also outstanding. Once we sat down our server was there for our drink orders. Food was brought to our table really fast and they cleaned off our dirty dishes very quickly. We also had our server and owner check on us to make sure everything is okay. Everyone makes you feel at home just like in Texas. \n\nSo good food (aka little too much), good service, and good dessert. Enjoy and bring a wheel barrow to roll you out. It's that good.", 'business_id': '18TUn9oiW0k0yB6lheiOvw', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2014-05-24', 'type': 'review'}

The steak is actually too big for anyone's appetite but there's enough gravy for about a quarter of the serving. The breading is mushy with no flavor. I've had the real thing in Ft. Worth and let me tell ya...real Texas CFS breading is thick, seasoned and CRISPY! The gravy should not taste like wet flour.

The noise level was too high, but we had so much time invested already that we decided to stay. \nMy salad consisted of a mountain of lettuce on a plate that was too small for it. As I ate, bits fell off my plate no matter how careful I was. I gleaned so many pieces of lettuce from the table and my lap that I built a little hillock. When the waitress came for the plate I quickly scooped up the pile with my hands and put it on top of the remainder of the lettuce on the little plate. She asked me if I wanted a box for my "salad."  Really. The lettuce mess was neither my fault nor hers, and I realize it is the server\'s job to clear the table, but it did happen on my watch so I would have felt churlish leaving it for her to clean up. She had liberally sown the floor with morsels of food fallen from over-filled plates being carried to diners, but least the hostess was constantly sweeping up the mess on the floor.\nAfter asking whether the rib eye or the New York would be the most tender I ordered the rib eye. When it came it took a monumental effort to cut it. I am strong, so I managed to hack off a couple of bites and finally complained that it was too tough. I was scolded for not ordering a filet in the first place and was asked if I would rather have that. It was a clumsy job of upselling, but I agreed to try one. As I waited for it to be cooked I couldn\'t keep from staring in morbid fascination at the ocean of gravy sloshing over the gunnel of the overfilled plate across from me. The so-called filet finally came and had the stringy texture of tenderized meat, not the buttery texture of a good filet, and it would have been a nice touch to comp me the difference between the rib eye and the filet, but I was charged the difference. The time to recommend the filet would have been when I first asked about tenderness, not after I had wrestled with the tough rib eye.\nOur visit to Texaz is not one we will repeat.\n\nPS Although we are seniors we would agree with the post below about the lack of seasoning. Some salt and a couple of squirts of Sriracha would work wonders.', 'business_id': '18TUn9oiW0k0yB6lheiOvw', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2014-07-07', 'type': 'review'}

The lunch prices are a total steal, with most entrees costing 8$ and the portions big enough for two people. We split the (house specialty) chicken fried steak and a brisket sandwich. I don't know that I've ever had chicken fried steak before, and I don't know that I would ever have it again (the idea of frying steak just doesn't sit well with me.... if I'm gonna eat steak, I want to taste it), but this CFS was fairly good. The meat was surprisingly tender, the gravy was flavorful, the portion was obscenely large. It came with very tasty mashed potatoes, a biscuit, and some plain jane corn. The biscuit was good, but not the best in town. The real star of this place was the brisket. Ohhhh the brisket gods smile on this place for sure. Their brisket is super tender and the sauce they put on it was heavenly. I ate the brisket with a fork out of the bun because the bun just obscured the awesome brisket flavor, no need for it. I will definitely come back here for the brisket!", 'business_id': '18TUn9oiW0k0yB6lheiOvw', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2014-10-08', 'type': 'review'}

We took the opportunity of being in Phoenix proper to swing by for dinner.  Service was friendly and reasonably efficient.  We ordered the chicken-fried steak and smoked prime rib.  We got the LAST piece of prime rib (it's limited every day, apparently).\n\nThe smoked prime rib was a bit fatty, but the flavor was very good.  The chicken-fried steak seemed to be a lot more breading than steak.  Believe it or not Denny's has a better breading/steak ratio.  The breading itself didn't seem to have any flavor or seasoning to it.  Usually I go very light on the cream sauce when I order a chicken-fried steak, but here you need to go heavier to give it more flavor.  Now to be fair it was really good when I did that, but I think that was much more the sauce than the steak.  Which just seems wrong to me.  The sauce should enhance the flavor, not embody all the flavor.  That's why I can't bring myself to go to four stars.  I could have put the sauce on a piece of bread and probably gotten about the same flavor experience.\n\nPortions were pretty generous, and the sides were basic but good.", 'business_id': '18TUn9oiW0k0yB6lheiOvw', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2014-12-04', 'type': 'review'}

I must say that the coleslaw is the best I\'ve ever had. \n\nThe portions are over the top gigantic. There is no way a normal person can eat this meal: for $14 you get two absolutely enormous pieces of meat covered in breading and smothered in cream gravy.

Of course, a lot of people then take it home, but warmed up chicken fried steak? Really?

For both meals the breading was crunchy and the meat was moist and tender.  The mashed potatoes weren\'t bad either.  I did ask for extra potatoes instead of an additional side/vegetable, and while the waitress said they "added half a scoop more" I didn\'t see any discernible amount added to mine when compared to everyone else\'s meal at the table.\n\nTheir gravy and breading are also on the bland side, as others have noted.  Generous use of salt and pepper perks it up though.\n\nThe pecan pie was decent enough, but not memorable.\n\nThe decor and interior are not my cup of tea.  It\'s way too dark (in a neon-lit bar gloomy way) and I don\'t care for their choice of decor at all.  I feel they could "open up" the space some by de-cluttering, which would possibly bring in a younger crowd.

We started with fried okra & beer battered shrimp and for our main course we had the chicken fried steak, chicken fried chicken and brisket sandwich. From the kids menu, we ordered  smoked prime rib. And for dessert we ordered the peach cobbler.\n\nFor starters, the biscuits and rolls we got didn't taste fresh, in fact, they tasted like they'd been warmed up in a microwave. Already a terrible start. But it did get better with our apps. The fried okra was very good, the okra was ripe, not at all bitter. The beer battered shrimp was also very good, light batter, fresh shrimp, our meal was looking better.\n\nThen dinner came, the chicken fried chicken was delicious, the chicken was juicy and battered very nicely. My chicken fried steak however, was very bland and there was so much more batter than meat. The gravy was very good and sort of made up for the steak. The brisket sandwich was very dry so we ordered a side of BBQ sauce, without it, it wasn't very appetizing, with it, it was pretty darn good, nothing fancy, just a lot of brisket and bread. The smoked prime rib from the kids menu was OK. It had a lot of fatty parts, I may be biased as I'm not a prime rib fan though. We could definitely taste the smoky flavor. We ordered a side salad with both steak dinners and they both tasted like bagged salad. Nothing great about the dressings either. The mashed potatoes that came with the steaks were pretty good, they had skin pieces which I personally love. No gravy, but I prefer mashed potatoes without so I was happy there.\n\nMy favorite dish of the evening was the peach cobbler. The peaches weren't fresh, they were frozen so I was slightly disappointed but the crust part made up for it. The crust, made from their biscuit batter, was slightly sweet and tasted just right with the peaches and vanilla ice cream, (adding ice cream is $1 extra).\n\nOverall, I didn't hate this place but I certainly didn't love it. The portions are massive so go hungry or prepare to take lots of leftovers home.", 'business_id': '18TUn9oiW0k0yB6lheiOvw', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2015-05-25', 'type': 'review'}

Then the corporations came in and made them cease and desist using the name Lone Star (beer and steak corps) which really was a shame.  They came back with the name TexAZ Grill.  The menu stayed the same as did the local following of patrons.  They have great pork chops, steaks and the BEST chicken fried steak in the city!

My brother and I arrived about 7:30p and opted to sit at the bar. The interior is awesome. Just a fun old Texas steakhouse right here in the heart of Uptown Phoenix. All kinds of crazy crap on the walls, great service, and awesome grub.\n\nI get that parking in there is a pain but there are plenty of open spaces across Bethany on the SE corner of the intersection. When you consider how far people walk when they have to park, for example, downtown or at the Biltmore -- TEXAZ is probably actually a shorter walk from your vehicle. Just a point is all.\n\nAnyways, the bartender (whose name I can't recall - shucks) was great. I told her it was my first time and she walked me through the menu and highlighted the chicken fried steak (their specialty) and the prime rib. I ordered the large prime rib and it was excellent. I have also tried the chicken fried steak and, while rich, it's also very good. Just all around, nothing but good things to say about TEXAZ Grill.\n\nPlus you get little glasses for your beer.

We are a large Hispanic family and the way we were treated, it felt as though we were in the 1960s and the civil rights movement had just ended. The waitress who took our order was rude, every little thing we asked for seemed like the biggest problem.\n\nBut the real issue was when the second waitress came and asked my husband to scoot in closer to the table because the lady behind him couldn't sit comfortable enough - mind you, said lady stopped her and told her she was fine - but the waitress insisted that he need to move to an uncomfortable position so that the other person would be better (HE WAS ALREADY SITTING WITH HIS BODY TOCHING THE TABLE)! Absolutely rude, uncalled for, and unnecessary - as clients our needs were, clearly, of less importance - which left us wondering why? From the moment we walked in, we received nothing but attitude, especially in comparison to everyone else enjoying their meals.\n\nThe food wasn't good and even if it had any goodness in it, we didn't taste it because we were beyond upset. It was incredible that there is such an atmosphere that still exist this way - we were in shock. \n\nThe most aggravating part? We were only in Phoenix for the day - we live in TEXAS! This restaurant is the most abominable example of Texas food and hospitality, if you really want something from the Texas menu then please come and eat here, in Texas - we really are a friendly state!
