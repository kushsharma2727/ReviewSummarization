I love tapas and the menu looked so promising...carpaccio with truffle oil, grilled octopus with a red wine reduction, and chorizo clams in a white wine broth.  My mouth waters just thinking about these dishes and many more on Barcelona\'s menu, but I\'m sad to report that this was one of the most disappointing restaurants I\'ve ever been to!\n\nIt just so happens that I recently acquired a coupon to this restaurant and went to it last Friday.  I just want to make it clear that I would have happily tried this place at full price, and the dish I was looking most forward to trying was the carpaccio (you just can\'t go wrong with raw beef and truffle oil...I\'d hope).  My boyfriend and I were seated and greeted promptly.  When the server came over to take our drink order, he looked down at my coupon, took it and went straight to the kitchen.  Being a server for a long time, I could tell he was not happy that we brought this coupon, but I tried to remedy the situation by being extremely nice.  We ordered the carpaccio, pan fried dates, steamed clams, diabla shrimp, grilled octopus, saut\xe9ed tilapia, albondigas, and merguez.  After a short while the tapas started coming out, and after delivering the first wave, our server said, "I\'m sorry, but the carpaccio is very popular and we are running out of it tonight."  I smiled and said disappointed, "oh really?" and he responded, "yes."  Both my boyfriend and I picked up on his wording, but we did not confront him about it.  It is my strong belief that they had enough carpaccio for AT LEAST another order, but they didn\'t want to waste it on a table with a coupon!  As the night progressed our server grew increasingly more impatient and annoyed with our presence.  When we got our check he had manually written in an 18% tip...on a table for 2, and I always automatically tip 20% (even when the service is bad)!  With a coupon or something comped, I usually tip much more because that\'s what fellow service industry workers do...(can you tell how livid I am?)  Unfortunately, I wish I could say that only the service was sub par, but the food ranged from ok to not even edible.\n\nPan Fried Dates- This was the best dish we had from Barcelona.  The bacon was cooked well, all of the textures were spot on, and they had a nice savory sweet taste.  However, the red wine reduction was way too thin, the blue cheese crumbles were on the stingy side, and Firefly\'s are much better.\n\nSteamed Clams- The clams were cooked well, but the chorizo was very dry.  The broth also needed more seasoning (this is a common theme).\n\nDiabla Shrimp- I liked this, but again, it was not as good as Firefly\'s.  A nice spicy sweet sauce with shrimp, but the sauce was a little too thin.\n\nGrilled Octopus- This just lacked seasoning.  The octopus was a pretty good texture, not too chewy, but the flavor was bland.  For good grilled octopus, try Olives in the Bellagio.\n\nSauteed Tilapia- Completely inedible!  I\'m not sure if the kitchen just didn\'t care or if they genuinely made a mistake, but the outside of the fish was mushy and the inside was raw.  I\'ve never seen fish this texture before, and I honestly can\'t think of how it happened.\n\nAlbondigas- Meatballs in marinara with melted mozzarella on top.  These were so dry we drenched each bite in the marinara.\n\nMerguez- A spicy lamb sausage served over roasted red pepper couscous.  The sausage was dry and not very spicy.  The couscous was a little wet, but it had a good flavor.\n\nThe one good thing about our experience was that the man refilling our drinks was extremely friendly!  He never let a drink go empty and explained they have live music some nights.  I really wish the food had been better so I could give this place a second chance.', 'business_id': '3AMFoTdFm7j2bocSpm7Xxw', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2010-03-25', 'type': 'review'}

Though  we found the answer to having our tapas without consuming a half tank of gas when we heard about Barcelong.  We went there for the first time this past Friday night.  We had 7pm reservations and were seated 5 minutes early.  Off to a good start.  The atmosphere is what I call "rustic, trendy".  Great backgound music.  Very upbeat.  Our waiter approached the table and that\'s where everything went downhill.  He didn\'t welcome us to the restaurant and didn\'t introduce himself.  Just asked us what we wanted to drink.  The drinks came quickly, delivered by another member of the wait staff.  It took 20 minutes before our waiter came to take our order.  The restaurant is not very large.  He passed by our table several times and could see, by our closed menus, we were ready to order.  I was starting to take it personally until I saw a man, seated at the table behind us, standing up with his hands on his waist staring in our waiter\'s direction.  Maybe he had been waiting longer than us.  We finally got to order and the food arrive quickly, again delivered by another member of the wait staff.  The food was awesome!!!  While we were eating, a group seated in another table next to us got into a bit of heated discussion with the same waiter.  They had been sitting for quite awhile without drink orders, let alone food, and wanted to move to the bar.  I couldn\'t hear all that was said, but I did see the waiter "dismiss" them with a wave of his arm.  More was said, then he ended up taking their drink orders.  It took more time to get a second round of drinks.  (By the way, the sangria was great!!)  He never asked if we wanted dessert.  I wanted to order dessert, but by that time, my fiance was so upset he wanted to get out of there.  We asked for our check.  The waiter brought the check and tossed the check across the table.  He walked away without saying another word.  We are pretty patient diners and have eaten at some of the finest restaurants Las Vegas has to offer.  There were no negative exchanges between us and our waiter.  We smiled the entire time.    I\'m not too sure if he was having a bad night or whatever, but it wasn\'t only us that were far from pleased with the service.  The waiter was flat out rude and indifferent.  Our service at Barcelona was the worst I have ever experienced in this city.  It upsets me, because the food was awesome.  The bus staff, the hostess were great.  Without them, we would have received no service at all.  I would love to go back, but not sure if I want to take a chance getting treated like that again.

There aren\'t that many options for tapas in Las Vegas beyond the two Firefly locations.\n\nBarcelona Tapas and Bar gives us one other place to consider when you\'re craving small bites.\n\nLocated in a busy strip mall where locals frequent, this restaurant had a few customers by the bar and dining when we walked in on a weekday night.\n\nI had a few things in mind immediately based on previous yelpers, so we got to ordering.  We munched on complimentary bread and spreads while we waited for our orders to arrive.\n\n* Beef Carpaccio "Thin sliced of tender tails drizzle with balsamic vinaigrette, truffle oil, tapenade, and fried onions" ($8) - I love beef carpaccio...when it\'s done right.  Yelpers raved about their version and sadly, we couldn\'t quite see why.  It\'s more like cured beef than raw beef, which is what we were expecting.  Not quite like beef jerky, but not delicate like what we\'re familiar with.  It was also covered with large shavings of cheese, which was not mentioned.   Not sure if this was to cover up the beef or enhance the taste.\n\n* Pastelillos de pollo (Chicken Cakes) "Chopped chicken, green and red onions, red pepper, chopped cilantro, black bean and corn salsa molded together and grilled served with gribiche." ($5.50) - Something a bit unusual that you don\'t see on every menu.  It\'s a bit misleading in its description since we were expecting all the ingredients to be \'molded together\' to create a corn cake.  In actuality, the black bean and corn salsa are on the side of the corn cake.  Nonetheless, it was quite tasty with the accompanying egg sauce.  And it is only one corn cake.\n\n* Merguez Lamb Sausage "Served with couscous, and roasted pepper tomato sauce and a Merlot wine reduction sauce." ($7.50) - There was a distinctive lamb taste to it, and what I\'m sure was some liver blended into the mixture.  The Husband isn\'t a fan of most livers so he was very aware of the funny taste to it.  Comes two in an order.\n\n* Pan Fried Dates "Pitted dates stuffed with almonds wrapped in bacon with merlot reduction and sprinkled with blue cheese crumbles." ($5.50) - Anything wrapped in bacon usually can\'t go wrong, and dates mix perfectly with bacon in this case too.  Comes five in an order.\n\n* Boquerones (White Anchovies) "Toasted French bread with a spicy aioli topped with sweet white anchovies and balsamic reduction sauce." ($5.50) - Anchovies were something we enjoyed everyday when we were in Spain, but we didn\'t know what took so long for this one order to come out.  The bread could have been toasted just a bit longer.  \n\n* Lomo a la parrilla (Petite Filet) "Mashed potato, mushroom and Merlot sauce." ($8.50) - Our final order, which we put in at the last minute.  It took a bit too long, and the waiter did come by to say it was coming out soon.  (It still took longer after that.  I can only assume that our order got stuck behind the larger parties that had come in after us.)  Another one of those dishes I ordered based on raving reviews, and sadly, it did disappoint.  We ordered it rare and although the center was pink, the outside was grilled a bit too long and thus hard.  \n\nWe were impressed by how busy it got for a weekday night - and Barcelona Tapas & Bar does cater to families with plenty of large tables, high chairs, and a diaper changing station in the restroom.  Right now they are offering an introductory and temporary offer where kids eat free on Sundays through Tuesdays from 4 pm to 8 pm, for those 10 and under only and with a purchase of an adult entree.\n\nService was okay - we asked our waitress for another set of silverware and she completely forgot about it.  (Immediately after we asked her, she went to sit a  party that arrived and never came back.)  We also had to ask for our beverages to be refilled.  The man who sat us did ask us how we had heard about them.  We also noticed the chef come by our table four different times to look at what we were eating, but never actually said anything to us.  \n\nSpecials include:\nMondays: Half off bottles of wine.\nTuesdays: Half off their homemade Sangria.\nWednesdays: Half off Martinis.\nThursdays: Half off Mojitos.\nFridays: Half off all their tapas from 4 pm to 6 pm\nSaturdays: Ladies Night with Half off all House drinks, wines and beer from 10 pm to 12 am.  Live music.\nKaraoke everyday (except Fridays and Saturdays) and tapas are half off after 10 pm.\n\nAccording to their website, they are open for lunch now - but their opening hours are still posted as opening at 4 pm.\n\nThere are coupons everywhere for them - restaurant.com, local newspaper, and online.', 'business_id': '3AMFoTdFm7j2bocSpm7Xxw', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2010-04-29', 'type': 'review'}

I actually went down to Southern Highlands for Uncle Al\'s hot dogs, but to my dismay, the place was closed.

Let me tell you, I was pleasantly surprised with the food, service and "drank." Let\'s break this down into categories. \n\nFood:\nPan Fried Dates - Excellent and highly recommended. For those that have been to Firefly\'s, they are essentially the same. Bacon wrapped dates, with Blue Cheese. \n\nSliders - Sliders come as 2 mini burgers and are just fine. Of course, I always say you can\'t ruin a burger that much when they are so simple. \n\nAbodingos (sp?) AKA Meatballs - Tasty little guys come in a marinara like sauce with lots of cheese. \n\nEmpanadas - There are two types to choose from. I had the chicken, but the alternative is Pork. Chicken was chosen because my friend doesn\'t eat pork. However, the chicken empanadas were excellent.\n\nFruit Parfait - The parfait was sweet and tasty. Raspberry, Strawberry and blueberries, with whip cream and a sweet yogurt like mixture. \n\nSangria - Thursday night is 1/2 off Sangria night. This means it\'s $3 per glass. Not too shabby and a good sized glass too. \n\nAtmosphere:\nI have mixed feelings on the atmosphere. Walls were great, but the tables were a bit small for me and I am only 6\'2". My knees hit the top of the tables. However, there were booths that looked like they had more room. It was a Lakers game night so it was rowdy because we were the only Lakers fans in the place. Every else was for Boston. :-( \n\nService:\nFood was fast, and service was excellent. It was more personal then most places. Waiter recommended, talked about the game, chit chatted and more. \n\n\n\n Pan frie dates. Sliders. Meatballs. Parfait for dessert. Empanadas.

The lamb sausage was soooo good and surprisingly spicy; potatas bravas (sp?) were very nice with a oregano and a hint of mint; pan-fried dates were such a party in my mouth - they were wrapped in bacon & topped with a bit of blue cheese; both the chicken and pork empanadas we cooked beautifully but I have to admit I preferred the pork; sauteed mushrooms were very flavorful and again cooked perfectly; the shrimp skewers had a tasty but not too spicy seasoning; and I wanted to keep slurping the steamed mussels broth!

Had the surf & turf skewers which were a bit on the overdone side but still had a pretty good flavor. We also had the stuffed red peppers which were very tasty as well. Just a quick sampling but we'll definitely be back.\n\nThe only comparison there would be to make here locally would be Firefly and honestly we prefer it for several reasons. The prices on the dishes are more reasonable at FF and they're a bit overpriced at Barcelona for what you're getting. Also, the flavors are just a little more refined at Firefly and their sauces are right on the money where Barcelona needs a little more practice.\n\nIf it sounds like we weren't happy that's far from the case.

Great options for vegetarians, omnivores and carnivores alike. Not too vegan friendly due to the excessive cheese factor in the menu. The decor reminded me of country bars/sandwich places in Texas so I didn't really get the Spanish vibe. I thought the prices were a little high ($5.50 to $6) for most tapas vegetarian items...rather small portions. \n\nThe items I sampled:\n\n1. Fried Goat Cheese ($6.50) - 4 panko crusted goat cheese balls deep fried and drizzled with honey balsamic. These balls tasted excellent. But I thought $6.50 for a small bite was a little outrageous\n\n2. Potatoes Bravas ($6) - Tasted pretty bad. I don't know how to describe it except that it was a serious letdown. $6 for a small portion of baked potatoes? I don't think so....\n\n3. Raviolis ($5.50) - Cheese medallion raviolis in a creamy tomato sauce. The sauce was excellent. But the raviolis (4 in an order) were undercooked\n\n4. Vegetable Empanada ($5) - 2 empanadas with a bean, corn, mushroom filling served with more beans and corn and a tomato based sauce. The pastry was flaky, the filling tasty and the entire combination a rousing success!\n\n5. Stuffed Piquillo Peppers ($7.50) - 3 peppers with goat cheese and beans and corns served in a tomato sauce. Tasty but definitely overpriced.\n\nWe had  pitchers of Mojitos that I felt were way too sweet. \n\nWe were there as a group of 12 for a birthday. Edgar, the owner was very accommodating and helped us with the table arrangements as well as the cake cutting. The rest of the wait staff...oh gosh. It was a travesty. Water glasses were never filled, our orders were totally ignored for the longest time, drink orders were messed up, we got pork Empanadas to the table twice even though we explicitly told the waitstaff we were vegetarian multiple times and had ordered vegetable Empanadas. Just dismal service. They did make accomodations on the check and acknowledged the awful service but I'd rather have had water to drink with my meal than pay a few dollars less. \n\nThese guys need to reduce prices and buck up on service before I'm tempted to try them again. 2.5 stars rounded up to 3.", 'business_id': '3AMFoTdFm7j2bocSpm7Xxw', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2010-11-08', 'type': 'review'}

Given its way-out-of-the-way location, I'd likely have otherwise not heard of it. After a few months of the $25 certificate sitting in our kitchen drawer, my girlfriend and I finally decided to make the trek out to Southern Highlands to check out this tapas joint. \n\nI was nervous at first; the Yelp! reviews were not encouraging. Everyone was basically saying the service was terrible, the place was too loud, and the food paled in comparison to Firefly (a favorite), especially for the price. But we gave it a go anyway, and ...\n\nI'm glad we did.\n\nWe went on a Friday night, which you'd expect to be a super-busy time, but it wasn't. Aside from one big party seated near the bar, the remaining booths were only half-occupied. We were greeted by the server/host immediately upon entering, and seated right away. He got our drink orders in before we even had to open the menus. Throughout our meal, we had servers constantly checking in on us, refilling water, etc. So, for us, the service was super.\n\nThe food? Pretty good in general. The patatas bravas were tasty, though could have been a hair spicier. The tortilla espanola was very satisfying, a thick, fluffy omelet that -- I hate to compare -- puts Firefly's to shame. I assume my girl enjoyed her manchego mac & cheese, because she ate it all. Even the toasted bread served with the meal (accompanied by a garbanzo bean dip and garlic cheese butter) was good. \n\nThe only thing that was not awesome was the tuna tartare. While it was inspired to serve it with tostada chips (that almost tasted like wontons!), the tuna was bland, even with accompanying pineapple cubes.\n\nBut that's the great thing about tapas -- you try a bunch of things, and some hit, some miss.\n\nThe red sangria we had was also very good. Not too sweet, not too strong, a good mix of wine and fruit. Someone else here thought it was too sweet. Maybe they had the white? We'll have to try next time.\n\nI don't know how soon we'll be back based solely on Barcelona's location (although we made it a date night with a movie at Southpoint, which was only about five minutes from there), but we'd definitely recommend anyone in the area try it.

It tasted good then but almost anything is good after "drinking".\n\nThe second time I was here I was with someone who did not eat certain foods and I was kinda full to begin with.  So we shared the EMPANADA.  From what I could remembert...it was not memorable.\n\nThis time...I wanted to give it one more shot.  I brought my son with me this time hoping he would like it and he would be able to give me honest  "TASTE BUDS OPINIONS"\n\nWe got there before dinner rush and there was only one couple in the whole place.  The host/waiter dude was in the back.  Maybe he did not hear us but maybe there should be a bell or something to let him know there are customers.  I had to go towards the back to find him and ask if we should sit ourselves.  \n\nWe chose a booth which the bench was lower than the table.  (just an observation)  My son had to get our menus since no one was really helping us. \n\nSo on the quickness for your reading...\n\nWaiter- not very talkative, ok for attentiveness, easy on the eyes but not warm.\nAtmosphere- the walls were black and ok "so-called Spanish" decorations.  Lots of TV\'s and there was a full bar. \n*House Salad- too vinegary, the sliced apples tasted as if they used an apple that was old\n*Calamari-bland, needed salt and seemed rushed out of the fryer since the batter was not fully crisp.  But at least the tentacles were there.  \n*Son\'s Sliders- he was sad there was no cheese (LOL).  My son was not too happy and said he\'d rather have McDo\'s.  So I had to take a bite since most kids would rather have McDo\'s.  The burger was dry and tasted like ground beef with the Lipton Onion Soup Mix.  He actually said he\'d rather have home-made burgers.  hahahhaha\nand the french fries that came with it...he said it\'s like those fries you get in a can....bwahahahaha.\n*Some sliced Steak thingy with mashed potatoes.  It was not hard and chewy but it was very salty.  \nMy son even tried to dip his dry-ass burger in the sauce of the steak...but  it did not help. \n***White Sangria-tasted just like cheap white wine with diced apple in it.  (To make good Sangria...it must be made overnight and have the flavors marry each other)-NO I will not share my special recipe which I promise will beat the SANGRIA @ CHA CHA CHA\'S in the Haight in San Francisco.  I assure you that. \n\nAnyways....I think this place is only staying in business because of the full bar and all the promos they run.  \n\nI THINK....they should close the place and I can take over running it as a Filipinasian Karaoke Bar and Restaurant....\nWhadda you think?????\nSOUTHERN HIGHLANDS  need some new flavor and some excitement.\n\n-Firefly is and will be better....sorry Barcelona.', 'business_id': '3AMFoTdFm7j2bocSpm7Xxw', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2011-01-26', 'type': 'review'}

I was VERY hesitant to try this, but it was AMAZING. He didn\'t like the balsamic drizzle, but I did... not "fishy" at all and one of the best dishes\nTortilla Espanola - It was just alright. Being from Spain, I think my man judges a little harshly, but I\'ve had better than this too. It didn\'t stop us from eating all of it though :)\nSteamed Mussels - So good. The broth was amazing, and so flavorful. We ate all of this in a hurry.\nGarlic Shrimp - Just what you would expect. Really good. Lots of garlic in a good way.\nCroquetas - There was supposed to be serrano ham in here, but we couldn\'t really taste it. Nonetheless, it was really good. Crispy outside, and really cheesy/potatoey goodness on the inside.\n\nAfter ordering all of this, and devouring it cause it was amazing, our server sent out a complimentary chicken cake :) \n\nOh, and it was national chocolate cake day, so I decided to get to Chocolate Tres Leches, and it was rich and sweet, and just what I needed to end dinner with.

And to make it worse, he reminded me of a used car salesman - extremely pushy about getting you to order certain dishes. The table next to us was a mom and young daughter.

You may want to ask for "light sauce" since some dishes (i.e. mushrooms) tend to be soaked in it.  I usually ask and they comply.\n\nAs for the service, it is usually pretty good. I don\'t know if they have had some turnover recently, but I notice some new faces working there.  But the owner/manager is a really nice guy and does a great job making tasy dishes.\n\nI\'d like to point out they have some awesome deals - 4-7pm everyday I believe the tapas at 1/2 off.  At 7pm, it flips and drinks become 1/2 off.  The 1/2 off times definitely make this place a much better deal.

The first time, I went to take advantage of the half off tapas on a Sunday after 8 PM.  I tried the pan fried dates, mac & cheese, butternut squash soup, and the baked cheese.  The mixture of the cream cheese and goat cheese in the baked cheese was a little too overwhelming, so we didn\'t continue eating it and it was thankfully removed from our bill.  The pan fried dates were pretty much the same as the stuffed dates from Firefly, which is fine by me.  The mac & cheese is better than the one served at Firefly in my opinion and the butternut squash soup was tasty as well.  We ended the meal with the bananas foster dessert and it was A-MAZING.  I\'m not even usually a "banana dessert" person, but this was awesome.  The service was great, but we were one of the only groups in the restaurant that night.\n\nThe second time I went was on a Saturday night.  It was much more crowded, which was good to see since I wasn\'t very sure how this place stayed in business based on the volume I saw the first time. Again, I had the pan fried dates and mac & cheese, which were still delicious.  I also tried the sliders and was very satisfied.  For dessert, I had the sweet empanada, which reminded me a lot of a Cuban dessert called pasteles de guayaba.  Overall, both experiences were good ones, but it\'s also nothing special.

The sauce was flavorful but not overpowering, the pineapple chunks went well with the sauce and the meat practically fell off the bone.

We must have come at a good time because we really didn\'t wait long for anything. However, I would say that a great deal of credit should also be given to our server, Marco. He was funny, engaging, and (most importantly) very attentive! \n\nFirst, and most importantly: the drinks were deceiving delicious in the sense that they were so tasty that I inhaled three glasses without hesitation only to find that I was pretty ridiculously drunk. The red sangria (arguably the only true sangria) was refreshing and light without being overly sweet or disrespectful to the essence of sangria. We had two pitchers. We also had a pitcher of mojito, which was just as refreshing and tasty (though I favored the sangria). For kicks, I tried a glass of white sangria to Marco\'s and my husband\'s chagrin, and while it was delicious, it was nowhere near as awesome as the red (which I refused to admit until now). \n\nSecond most importantly: the food. Delicious. I read a few reviews prior to visiting and was worried about the menu until I realized that the issues were mostly with the marinara sauce dishes and I had no interest in them to begin with. Worries gone! \n\nAnyway, the food was fantastic. We actually viewed the menu ahead of time and wrote out a list of the items we wanted to eat (for a group of 5). After the first round, we narrowed down to those we wanted seconds of and, voila, we were full and drunk! \n\nWe had:\n\n- Bread Course (complimentary): I think we had a cannelini and honey almond spread. Both were such a great start, but that butter was lardy crack, I swear! I wanted to spread it on everything and make the world a happier place with it. \n\n- Calamari: Good portion and tasty sauce. I\'m partial to the battered calamari over the breaded variety so I was a happy camper. \n\n- Tortilla Espanola: I know it\'s just egg and potato, but it\'s really easy to eff this up. I think it was cooked perfectly (and it got "pretty close" remarks from my husband, the guy who thinks all tapas places not in Spain can\'t get it right).\n\n- Chicken and Mushroom Soup: Not my call. Soup with sangria? What kind of nut orders that? My sister, that\'s who. But the soup was good!\n\n- Bacon-Wrapped Dates: Standard fare done well here. We got seconds. \n\n- Manchego Mac and Cheese: I swoon for cheesy goodness and everyone gobbled theirs up, but I couldn\'t get seconds because everyone else does not have the same dairy love that I do. \n\n- Patatas Bravas: Okay, you know how when you eat out and something\'s supposed to be spicy but, usually, it really isn\'t? That is not the case. I love heat, but even I caught myself saying, "WOO!" and gulping down sangria. We for sure got seconds!\n\n- Escargot: The sauce, the snails, the veggies... they were soppingly good. The toasted bread was the perfect accompaniment and we all found ourselves wiping the plate clean so as to not waste that delectable sauce. Seconds? Yes!\n\n- Beef Carpaccio: It was dressed so well with the fried onions, balsamic sauce, and cheese. Hell yeah we got seconds! \n\n- Garlic Shrimp: We got seconds, first, because it only comes in a set of three and we had five people. Secondly, garlic butter sauce, man! \n\n- Petit Filet: It was like a mini meal of perfectly cooked steak and mashed potatoes. We got seconds. \n\n- Chocolate Tres Leches: I WANTED to get seconds! \n\n- Bananas Foster: Thank you, Marco, for this treat! What a satisfying end to such a fulfilling meal! \n\nAll this fun and gorging came out to about $40-$50 a person with tax and tip thanks to the magic that is Happy Hour. \n\nThe only downside is that, for a non-local who comes in from LA, it\'s a trek to get out here, but sometimes one should venture away from the main haunts.

Sometimes called the Spanish dim sum, these dishes are the perfect size to try a few. I am not the type of person that goes to a happy hour to save money, instead I order twice what I normally would and have it even out in the end.\n\nThe fantastic dishes: \nChilled orzo salad- The orzo was cooked al dente with a nice bite and the grilled veggies were very flavorful. \nBeef carpaccio- This was a generous portion of thinly sliced raw beef. The parm, fried onion strings, balsamic vinaigrette, and tapanade mingled well. Place on on the bread and you have a good contrast in textures.\nStuffed peppers- The creaminess of the three cheese blend with a corn and black bean salad was mellow compared to the other strong tastes.\nBananas foster crepe- The crepe was more crisp than normal, but was perfect with the softness of the caramelized bananas and ice cream.\n\nThe good:\nStuffed dates wrapped in bacon. These were pretty standard.\nFried goat cheese- The balsamic vinegar and honey that line the dish made it delicious, but very decadent.\nSummer bean salad- good but took the dressing from the goat cheese to make it better.\nStrawberries tossed in a balsamic vinegar and cream with a sugar crust. Was decent, the balsamic did not play a prominent part in the dish.\n\nThe bad:\nTuna tartar- I love raw tuna in any form, but my friend said it all when she said it looked like cat food. It was bland on top of looking less than appetizing. \nFried tres leches a la mode- Tasted and had the texture of fried chicken. Not the most appealing of the desserts.\n\nThe desserts are not part of the tapas deal for happy hour. The only one I would pay full price for is the bananas foster crepe.

The patatas bravas, wrapped in bacon, are cooked perfectly to taste on the inside like baked potato. The chicken banderas are bite-sized skewers of garlic, roasted pepper, grilled chicken and avocado, served with a tasty vinagrette.

All of the booths in the restaurant section were full, so my wife and I grabbed a booth like table in the bar as noone was there and it seemed the best choice at the time. It turns out we should have picked a different table as my seat looked right into the kitchen, boxes of soda, the co2 tanks, some dude sitting on a box on his break.  The opening to the kitchen does have some black curtains but they weren\'t using them and had them tucked back presumably because it was annoying for the workers to walk thru them.  I\'m guessing the decorator or owner put those curtains there for a reason, would be nice to see them used.\n\nThe menu prices and drinks are all reasonably priced, so no complaints there. They have lots of coupons available including a discount on Yelp, as well as a 3 hour happy hour with most dishes 50% off so if you time it right you get a big bang for you buck.\n\nI ordered the Grilled Octupus and Shrimp Ceviche to get started with while we looked at the rest of the menu for other stuff.   5 minutes later, the Waitress returns with a "I\'m sorry we don\'t have any Grilled Octopus or the Shrimp Ceviche tonight". I\'m mildly irritated at this point as:\n\na.) these are two of my favorite items\nb.) I hate it when waitresses don\'t tell you what they are out of when you sit down.\n\nok, granted they may be out of Octopus because it is not fresh, etc but they do have plenty of other shrimp dishes on the menu so regarding the shrimp ceviche I think it was more of poor planning or lack of desire to make more.\n\nI asked if there were any more items that they didn\'t have, and the waitress scampered off to the kitchen again to ask (is it really that hard to know what items you aren\'t serving tonight???) She mentioned two other items they didn\'t have one of which was another dish I was interested in, big sigh :(\n\nThe food was quite good. My only real complaint was the lack of product knowledge from the waitress. We asked a couple of basic questions like what kind of cheese is on this? etc only to get a blank stare with her picking up the menu to look :)\n\nIt\'s also milldy irritating when they just drop off the food without a brief explanation.  This is XXX, this is YYY.  My wife and I had ordered escargot and they just dumped it off, we thought it was another dish we had ordered because the escargot was prepared in a method we weren\'t used to (it was good, but would have been nice to know we were eating it :) )\n\nWaitress made two more mistakes regarding the check.  a.) didn\'t deduct the value of the coupon even though I gave it to her when we sat down, when she adjusted the bill, she gave me the wrong change and I had to point out her mistake to her. Not the end of the world, but I enjoy my evenings out without having to go through small hassles.\n\nOverall, I would give the food a solid 3.5 stars, and the service about a 2.  \n\nI will give this restaurant another try when I\'m in the area. Hopefully, they won\'t be out of the items I want and we will get a better waitress.

I mean, we\'re talkin the door\'s unlocked, but the "open" sign is turned off, the chairs are still sitting inverted on the tables, and neither the owner nor any waiters are there.\n\nThe first time, one of the cooks, who was busy in the kitchen, heard us come in and came out to greet us and offer us something to drink and eat. He didn\'t know how to make mixed drinks, but was happy to offer us some red sangria. The owner showed up 20 or so minutes later, apologized, and offered to make us something else (not comped or even discounted for the inconvenience, mind you).

Both the cook and she were very nice and accommodating, but I\'m still confused as to why they pretend to open at 11:30am when they clearly barely open at noon.

I went in for a glass of wine, came out with new friends and a promise to return for some food. I went back three times the following week, including my birthday party.\n\nCasual with an elegant, tony *feel*, but inviting, not ostentatious, and fabulously friendly. \n\nSome of the Firefly favorites (you did know they're within that six degrees of separation idea, right? Well, now you do.) are here, with a twist. The stuffed dates, patatas bravas and various others are throwbacks (in a good way) of what we love from the Firefly*.\n\nThe first standout for me: The escargot is simply amazing. I am so used to the tasty (but overused) butter and garlic bath in which snails are usually prepared and presented. En croute or no, let's face it, they're done that way everywhere... everywhere, that is, but at Barcelona. A savory, tomato-based broth with complementary veggies and a healthy (but not overpowering) bit of spice for kick. I can admit it... we ordered it three times. For one friend, it was her first taste of escargot and I was so pleased it was here. We have a convert! Snails *are* yummy!\n\nThe portions are perfect; I am only left wanting more because something is that good, it is not for a lack of generosity on the part of the kitchen.\n\nSmaller and more attention-oriented, Barcelona allowed for dietary substitutions (within reason, of course) and was helpful to a fault in finding dishes we would like or helping us if something just wasn't what we expected (diner error, I assure you, and no reflection of the restaurant).\n\nEverything tasted fresh and the flavors were clean.

I just wished I was served this first so I could have had room for seconds.\n\nBeef sliders, I'm not a big fan of burgers but from what my brother said, it was bomb . com.

Their thin fries were pretty good also, it had a nice crunch to it.\n\nManchego mac&cheese, definitely enjoyed this one a lot better than Firefly's, the taste was spot on. My boyfriend even enjoyed it, so big thumbs up for BT&B!\n\nPaella, it was okay, I just didn't like having big, uncut lumps of chicken in there.

The waiter comes up, brings us water then disappears. He never introduced himself, nor did he show any interest in taking our order. It took about 10 minutes before he came back to take our order. \n\nThe food was great. Everything was cooked perfectly, leaving my girlfriend and i impressed. We asked for the check and gave the waiter the coupon we had bought off one of those group coupon websites. He instantly became hostile claiming that it was more work for him because he had to activate it and deduct it from the final check.  He returned and threw the check in front of me. He never once said thank you, or even came back to check on our drinks. I finished the check and we left.\n\nHe followed me into the parking lot and asked for a signature, which I had forgotten to do out of irritation. The gentlemen began to tell me I shouldn\'t be angry about the coupon situation that it was just more work for him. I had never seen any waiter be so assertive. I told him I was upset about the fact that he didn\'t check on us once during our meal. He than said, "I don\'t need your excuses." My excuses for what? For not tipping him? He didn\'t deserve a tip considering how rude he was. He stormed off and called me an a**hole at the door of the restaurant as he was walking in.  After leaving I attempted to call the restaurant for a manager, but the phone kept going to voicemail. This was during business hours by the way.\n\nI\'m sorry but that was unacceptable. Not even in the most run down places in town do you have the waiter insult you. Even these waiters are more gracious than this guy.  Horrible service.

They weren't horrible, and they weren't great. The sliders weren't anything to write home about, as the meat quality was average at best. The fries were quite good, however shouldn't be a determining factor for patrons. \n\nThe determining factors in this case: The service is horrible, and food is average at best. These two facts, coupled together should be a deal-breaker. It is as if they take pride in offering poor service. The wait staff would place the wrong orders in front of the customer, and did not seem to care if people are satisfied. They did this both with the drinks, and later with the entrees. One guest at our table had to wait ten minutes for ketchup, and when we finally got a waiter's attention, he was visibly annoyed at our request. On a side note-the coffee tasted like it had been sitting in the pot all day before being served. \n\nStrangely enough, if I see reviews for good food and poor service, I'm not deterred, as I see it like a 'soup nazi' situation: The food should be so outstanding that people overlook the horrible customer service in order to experience good tastes. \n\nIn the case of Barcelona Tapas & Bar, I recommend avoiding this place, as the poor service does not justify the lackluster food served and the atmosphere is uncomfortable. \n\nI think the fancy name 'tapas' makes a place like this appear special, but in my case, it is simply a place to avoid.", 'business_id': '3AMFoTdFm7j2bocSpm7Xxw', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2011-12-05', 'type': 'review'}

The waiter/waitress is always very prompt with bringing over some fresh bread with honey butter and hummus, which is outstanding. I prefer the Sangria at Barcelona, the white-red mix is definitely the way to go. The wait staff always have time to check on the food and the experience, a nice addition to service at a neighborhood restaurant. Overall, I've always had great service. The menu and food is comparable to Firefly, in fact I sometimes feel like they ripped off the menu, which isn't a bad thing. My favorites are the bacon wrapped dates, the albondigas, the empanadas,  the chicken skewers, and the stuffed mushrooms are very good! The food quality at Barcelona definitely gives Firefly a run for its money and the wait staff actually come back and chat with you. At a busy Tapas place like Firefly(although it's super fun for a party) you don't get the personal experience. Also they have live music sometimes which is AWESOME! Spanish style guitar, so romantic!\n\nLarge Group Dining:\nLast year I had my birthday dinner here. The restaurant handled the additional 30 people on a busy Saturday night with calm and provided the best service. Everyone got everything they ordered and in a timely manner.

I have mixed emotions about tapas, just because I've been programmed from a young age to appreciate large portions and having small plates with small portions (though plentiful) messes with my head :)  I also think I end up spending more that way...but I think that speaks more to my issues than to Barcelona.\n\nFirst off, I've passed this place a million times and never eaten here.  It's conveniently located and easy to find in the Smith's shopping center.  It's much bigger inside than I imagined!  I mean, it's a modest size, but I pictured it much smaller.  We went in the late afternoon on a Saturday and it wasn't too busy.  We were seated and proceeded to order off the Happy Hour menu (half off).  Also, by checking in on Yelp, you get a free drink!  Awesome!\n\nMy friend and I ordered about 7 happy hour tapas...mac n cheese, escargot, some kind of chicken dish, eggplant dish, mushroom dish...and a few other things I can't remember.  Everything was REALLY good!  Drinkwise, we went with the sangria and mojitos.  I think I enjoyed the mojito more, but both were pretty good.\n\nAll in all, I don't have any complaints.  Our server was so nice and very attentive.  This place had a very comfortable and homey feel to it.  Everything seemed clean and in its place.  I do have to reinforce...tapas DO add up, especially the way my friend and I eat, so I probably would not come at any other time slot besides happy hour which is 4-7p Sun-Thurs and 4-6p Fri-Sat.", 'business_id': '3AMFoTdFm7j2bocSpm7Xxw', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2012-07-03', 'type': 'review'}

For me, this was a craving that spanned the course of three weeks. So when a friend wanted to meet up for dinner, I knew that Barcelona's happy hour was a must.\n\nFrom the hours of 4 to 7, happy hour is a must do. Check in on Yelp for a free glass of sangria - sweet, strong, and in quantities more than a single glass, potentially dangerous. My friend and I ordered a mass array of goodies from the happy hour menu. The vegetable empanadas ($2.75) were little fried pockets of all sorts of vegetables - pretty good but nothing fantastic. Croquetas ($2.75) were also good, only made better with the aioli on the side. Lastly, the eggplant cannelloni ($3.50) was perfectly balanced with the hearty eggplant and the tang of tomato sauce. \n\nWhile dessert was the last thing on my mind, we somehow got conned into ordering...wait for it, Fried Chocolate Tres Leches a la Mode (I take liberties with the word 'conned'). Sometimes you don't realize you're having a bad week until you take a bite into something so sinfully delicious. One bite of this Tres Leches and suddenly, life is better. \n\nThe food is good, and the happy hour deals amazing. But the real keeper here is Edgar, the owner. He's so warm and hospitable.

This place has its own charm. \n\nThe decor is a bit shabby-chic, lending to a laid-back, casual atmosphere, but it's an interesting look, not a bad one. There's a slight sports pub feel due to the TVs and the wide variety of objects on the walls, which were painted dark green (at least the wall alongside my area). The booths are roomy and comfy with slightly high tables. I really liked the servers - very friendly and attentive.\n\nThis is a tapas restaurant, therefore there are only a few entrees. I didn't feel like eating a bunch of little meals (ironic, huh?) so I had the pasta entree. My friend had a Groupon, which is why I happened to be invited for this outing.  My pasta dish was not bad, and neither were the fries I tried, but as there was nothing special about them I would try something different during my next visit.  The bread and butter were good, though. That butter was heavenly, as a matter of fact. I hate sweet honey butter but this butter was just right in terms of flavor, sweetness, creaminess (and the way it melted on my tongue like a dream!). \n\nMy friend loved her bacon-wrapped dates and had no complaints about her mac & cheese, beef (veal?) medallions or sangria.  I was impressed that our waiter didn't give us a hard time about the Groupon, as some restaurants do.  The restaurant has its own version of a Groupon on their website, by the way.

When it comes out and served to your table, other patron will say, "what\'s that smell?"  \n\nLastly, the banana pancakes.  I\'ll tell you why this is a must try.

More so when they first opened, I believe it was around 2009. At first I really liked it. My husband and I used to go at least once a week! We loved the bartender, Melissa who I might add is no longer with them. I feel that I never reviewed this place for that reason, because we just really enjoyed her service, even after numerous bad meals there. \n I've had meals there that were hit or miss. The food is extremely inconsistent. You have a dish you love, like their Tilapia, for instance was great the last few times I ate there the sauce was different, and the tilapia was so way overlooked. The last straw for my husband was when on Fathers Day last year they had a prime rib or ribeye special, can't remember which. My husband asked the weight, again don't remember if they said 12 or 16 ounces. It was so shady and sneaky, it couldn't be more than 4 and a half ounces! The shady part is this, it was cut very very thin and at a strange angle. It looked like perhaps the rest of this tiny piece of meat was under the mashed potatoes it was served with. My husband lifted up the potatoes and there was nothing there! They cut it slanted and made it appear that the rest of the meat was under the potatoes. If we didn't look, we couldn't prove that this was not the size that said. So sneaky, so much lack of respect for their customers, not to mention we were regulars! Our server was so embarrassed and apologetic. On the top of it it was Father's Day! He was so upset he did not order anything else or has yet to return. My dumb ass have given them so many more chances and wasted to much meals there. My wonderful drinks by Melissa kept me going for their mediocre food, but not since this past Saturday, February 8th, was my meal so horrible! Stuffed mushrooms tasteless, served cold in the middle and just a funny texture. My 7 year old said Barcelona Tapas made her hate mushrooms! She said the best thing was the sprite. The ribs although very tender and fell off the bone outrageously sweet, it was a pile of meat and bones and pieces of bone mixed in the meat.  We ordered a filet, which was not a filet, it was chewy, had weird bristle and we  ordered medium rare, it was medium well. So 10 dollars for crap! It was a horrible mistake to eat there and we ruined our Saturday night by choosing Barcelona Tapas.

The saut\xe9ed calamari was extremely rubbery and tasted not night, saut\xe9ed spinach with garlic was edible but soaked & chewy, stuffed mushrooms with chorizo tasted ok but something off with the cheese, and lastly the filet mignion medallions were the worst tasting meat dish of my entire life...the meat was rubbery, tasted as if it had been frozen, thawed, and sat for days until it was almost bad. I had high hopes for a tapas restaurant in south Vegas...very disappointed.

Apparently that's never been done before and the server asked if he could take our picture! The only thing was, everything came out very close together, leaving some plates to get cold, unfortunately.\nAlso, the jalape\xf1o mango margarita, delicious.

We were excited to come here for the end of the week happy hour and to get ready for the weekend but were surprised how bland the food was.  It was obvious that they did not use fresh ingredients.  We ordered a few items that were served within two minutes, which leads us to believe that is pre-made and either sitting under a heat lamp or microwaved for quick delivery.  The food came quickly and was really hot for about 45-60 seconds on the surface but cool on the inside. We ordered the stuffed artichokes that were rubbery (squeaked as you chewed), mac and cheese was ok and the tortilla a la espanola had no flavor, not even the "spicy" sauce that comes with it and the last thing you would want is lukewarm eggs and potatoes. Finally, we got the chicken picatta. This was the last one to come out so they probably cooked this one. The sauce and potatoes that comes with it were good. Chicken was ok, basically a pounded out chicken breast. Maybe they don\'t make their food for happy hour and just reuse leftovers. The food was bland, nothing like real tapas or true Barcelona flavor. The service was ok, nothing horrible but nothing great - didn\'t feel really welcomed but not neglected either.
