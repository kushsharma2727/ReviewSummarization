Remember, this is the first day.  I ordered a drink and there was much confusion as glassware is limited to mason jars\' I ordered fried oysters and bbq baked beans.  The beans were immediately served, (I make much better).  I played with the beans but did not eat them.  Five to ten minutes later my drink and oysters arrived.  The drink was OK and the oysters need future attention. The acoustics are terrible!  With all of the noise, I had to leave.  I\'ll try the bbg next time, but the portions were not as large as the first review stated.  I\'m glad there is finally a  restaurant in the vacant slot.  I hope they get the bugs worked out.

I am so glad I did. This food was phenomenal. I had the hush puppies (3$ for about a thousand of them), which had jalapeno inside and were little fried balls of joy. I tried a grilled oyster... never had this before... it was so fantastic. Garlicky and wonderful. There aren't many places where I would actually order oysters, but this is now added to my list. For my meal, I had the fried cod po' boy (7$.... yes you read right... and this thing was big enough for 3 meals) with a side of the 'trifecta' sauce at a level 3 spiciness. This was damn good... spicy, without being too spicy. The fish was flavorful without being fishy. The bread was soft and delicious. The fries it came with were crunchy and spiced perfectly. This place has some serious 5 star potential pending a second visit (which should happen in the near future). Definitely recommend!!!\n\n\nPS they have Abita beer here, which was good, and the service was fantastic... these guys really took care of us.

I freaking love that city. I love that nothing ever closes. I love that people speak French. I love that you can take drinks TO-GO from restaurants. I love that it is simultaneously home to some of the finest white-glove restaurants in America as well as some of the seediest, most degenerate bars that have ever been built. And most importantly, I LOVE the food.  So when I saw that Angry Crab, a Mesa restaurant that I\'ve been meaning to get my Cajun fix from for months, was opening a new location down the street from my house, I was beyond thrilled.\n\nAngry Crab doesn\'t necessarily bill itself as a "New Orleans" restaurant, but the elements are there. Cajun seafood boils, po-boys, oysters (even char-grilled!), and alligator are all on the menu and when we ventured over, a whopping 4 days after they open (I\'m surprised I could even wait that long) I knew exactly what I wanted: A dozen raw oysters and a pound of crawfish.  Unfortunately, after we were greeted by our cheerful waitress, we were informed "We\'re out of crawfish and we\'re out of raw oysters". Whomp whomp. So I guess they need to work out some kinks in inventory, understandable since they\'ve been open for such a short period of time, but I honestly might not have even gone had I known that in advance.\n\nInstead we split a dozen wings (kinda like oysters right? Except...not at all), I got a pound of snow crab (trifecta sauce, spice level 2) and Lance got the Alligator Basket.  The wings were delicious. Instead of traditional wing sauce we just got the same trifecta sauce they use for the boils and it was fantastic, no ranch or any additional dipping sauce was needed.  My crab legs were also awesome, and a HUGE portion. I wasn\'t exactly sure how much a "pound" would be, considering the shell-meat weight ratio, but it was more than enough for me and would probably be enough for two people to share with a couple apps and sides.  At $15/lb that day for the snow crab (less or more for other items), I thought it was a pretty decent value.  I was too busy working for my food to try any of the Alligator basket but it was devoured so I\'m sure it was good too.\n\nAll-in-all, I\'m looking forward to Angry Crab reversing the curse of that particular location so I can keep getting my NOLA fix without buying a $300 plane ticket (and nursing a 3-day hangover because, come on, it\'s New Orleans). I\'ll update when I can go back to get my oysters and crawfish, which I\'m sure I\'ll find a way to do VERY soon (though I\'ll call ahead this time).', 'business_id': '5D5DLnLMYiIt2ztgp6rTqA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2014-10-27', 'type': 'review'}

The Snow Crab was cooked perfectly, it was so juicy and tender I was very sad to see I ate it all it was that good!\n\nI also added an order of hush puppies, that was some fried up goodness right there and tried out there bbq beans, those were not the most pretties to look at but it made up in flavor for sure, before I knew it. it was gone.\n\nThe Angry Crab was a great dinner choice, look forward to going back!", 'business_id': '5D5DLnLMYiIt2ztgp6rTqA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2014-11-05', 'type': 'review'}

A crowded restaurant, but didn't have to wait too long for seating. They have the Cajun style seafood with the addition of fried sides and even BBQ.\n\nOf course I had to try their Trifecta sauce and shrimp and decided to go for the frozen crawfish and Tamarind sauce just to try- both with Medium heat. The latter you should pass on. Also decided to try their fried soft shell crab with cajun fries and some soda.\n\nTheir shrimp seems so much bigger here, fresh and their Trifecta sauce was well balanced. Their sauce isn't too liquidy or dry, overly salty but good cajun flavor. \n\nPass on the Tamarind sauce as it was overly salty, way spicier than Medium and had a strong fishy taste to it. Nothing close to what Tamarind really tastes like, the frozen crawfish is to be expected. Dense and not fresh tasting- but I knew that ordering it for $8 a pound.\n\nGreat service! Checked back on often, refilled drinks and I love that they provide lemons or limes and all kinds of hot sauces.\n\nCan't wait to come back to try some of their BBQ!

Here's our experience:\nMy wife & I were quickly seated, and our waitress quickly got to our table and explained how things work at the Angry Crab. At this point we're thinking we are in for a good meal. Drinks were served right away and we looked forward to the arrival of the food. This is where things went downhill. \n\nMy meal arrived first. I ordered the brisket which was not good. It was mooshy and tasteless aside from the bbq sauce that was ladled onto the meat right before it arrived. The meat tasted like it may have been boiled before it was put into the smoker. If you want to taste the real thing head to south Phoenix and try Little Miss BBQ (it's a TEN). I did eat most of the brisket because I was hungry. I give it a 3 out of 10. Bummer.\n\nAfter I completely finished my meal my wifes diner arrived. Timing not so good. \n\nShe ordered battered shrimp. We expect deep fried anything to have some oil on it since it is submerged in the stuff until cooked. Problem here was that the fries tasted like shrimp, so we think it is all deep fried together. Also, the batter held onto too much of the grease. It left a heavy after taste. The corn that was served was COLD, not like it had become cold by sitting, but cold as if just taken out of the fridge cold (yuk!). \n\nI brought a pulled pork sanny home for  my daughter. I tasted the pork once home: same mooshy boiled flavor the brisket had. It was not something I would order again. Sorry guys.\n\nThe drinks were great and Rachel provided great service. I really want this place to work, so I am going to give it another try. I will order the crab and shrimp boil next time I go in. I hope it is good.

The spicy level at this restaurant is pretty strong.  We had medium and it has some kick already.  The shrimp is nice and big, but may not be completely fresh.  The clam has a little bit of sand inside.  The frog leg was a nice surprised, but the frog leg was huge and a bit chewy.  the meat has a bit waxy taste.  Perhaps frog taste is just not for me.\n\nBeside the Cajun food, I ordered the Pit Plate which contains brisket, rib and pulled pork.  I had the mustard sauce and it was tasty.  Meat fall off the bones and are very tender.  I strongly recommend this over the cajun food.', 'business_id': '5D5DLnLMYiIt2ztgp6rTqA', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2014-11-25', 'type': 'review'}

This is one of those places where the bigger the group of people the better the value. You order by the pound, you share, and everyone gets messy together.\n\nI brought a friend from back East and we both grew up on seafood from the Chesapeake Bay. We were looking forward to blue crabs but they were out. From the remaining seafood choices - and we decided to stick with seafood instead of barbecue - we chose shrimp, crawfish, and king crab legs. Trifecta sauce, mild heat because our server, Dion, said that things run on the spicy side.\n\nSo, it's entirely possible that ordering Alaskan King crab legs at the angry crabshack and barbecue is a bit of a reach. I didn't care because I have to try them, right?\n\nI wasn't disappointed in them, however, roasted and then split and served with drawn butter is just the best way to eat Alaskan King crab legs and now I know. Everything was delicious just the same and cooked just right. Nothin worse than rubbery overcooked skrimps and there was none of that here. \n\nI couldn't pass up the sausage four-piece and I'm glad that I tried it because it is excellent. For me it was the most memorable part of the entire meal and I will be going back soon for more. I've got to try the barbecue as well.

While I was pondering...he said yeah you do and brought it to me and charged me for it. I get it that I still drank it but really? Ya you do? Let me answer for myself. Or if you're making the decision for me, you pay for it!  My friend ordered brisket and it looked like it was kind of jelly like. It seemed super fatty and he said it was not appetizing.

So I thought me and the gf would check it out. \n\nSo lets just say it was not what I expected. It was extremely busy about a 15 minute wait, this was around 9pm on a Friday night, I would almost suggest going later to miss the end of the happy hour crowd. They take your number and text you when your table was ready, but I never got the text, they just came out and called for me when our table was ready. I would highly suggest if your going to go on a weekend night to call and reserve so you don't have to wait. And this place is loud, you can barely hear the person across the table from you, I would not say it is a good place to bring kids, or for intimate conversations. Most of the crowd was couples and groups of young people eating dinner, very few families, and allot of the area hipsters hanging out at the bar. \n\nSo my gf got the pulled pork Sammich and I got the alligator basket we both got gumbo. The gumbo was good, I know they use bay leaves in the cooking process but I wish that they would strain them out before serving it. I just don't like them. Nothing like biting into a big old bay leaf. But otherwise the gumbo was pretty good, served hot, but I would have preferred whole pieces of sausage and shrimp, it seems like the sausage was chopped up to small pieces and the shrimp was in pieces too, I never quite got a whole one. All in all it was very good and served piping hot, It comes in like a plastic Tupperware type serving dish so you can put a cap on it and take it to go if you want. \n\nMy alligator was seasoned quite well, but it was a bit fried too long, which dried it out and it was a bit disappointing, when you fry alligator, they need to be more flash fried when cooking it, alligator is a white meat, and it doesn't hold moisture well so if you over fry it, it dries out quite a bit, that's what happened to mine anyhow. This place would of got 5 stars if it was not for that. Overall the the food was good, the Cajun fries were heavily seasoned, was not to big of fan of the potato salad, should maybe try the coleslaw next visit. \n\nThe service was good, our server Cassie was very informative, and was sure to keep checking on us and made sure our beverages were kept full. I wish she would have offered to give us a marker I would have like to put some graffiti on the walls like most other people appeared to do. I am a fan will definitely come back soon for the crab or lobster. I suggest giving it a try.", 'business_id': '5D5DLnLMYiIt2ztgp6rTqA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2015-01-17', 'type': 'review'}

The shrimp was great and a level 2 trifecta was definitely spicy considering we both grew up eating spicy food! The potatoes and corn were big portions to our surprise, we could have ordered less. The cajun fries were just alright, but we ordered two baskets of it to cool down our tongues from the spicy shrimp. And last but not least, the oysters were fresh and huge! Hubby loves oysters so if he approves then so do I. Seriously though, these oysters were so meaty we were a little worried they were on steroids or something haha. One complaint is that they don't do half pounds or offer combos with mixed seafood unless you get it by the pound. Good customer service, and no wait at 3:30pm on a Friday. Food comes out fast too!\n\nSo recap: 1 lb. shrimp, 4 potatoes, 3 corn (half pieces), 2 baskets of fries, a dozen oysters. Came to $41 excluding tip. Great deal.

I've been to lots of fine dinning restaurants, but I must say the service was outstanding. Dion kept all the beverages full, replenished napkins, and removed finished items without us even asking. The restaurant was packed too, so extra skills points. If you look around all the staff seemed to enjoy being there and it showed. I SO,,,can't wait to come here again.

OMG-it was so good, in fact it was so good that I made another trip there before I left Phoenix. The first night I went there I had Justin as my waiter. He was an excellent waiter and he had the best personality. He gave us excellent customer service. I ordered the level 3 which is suppose to be hot, it wasn't (but it was still good). We ordered, lobster, shrimp and two types of crab. Out of everything the snow crab was my favorite. The second time I went I had a waiter that wasn't very good (cannot remember his name). This time I ordered the level 4 of the snow crab. The waiter kept trying to talk me out of getting it and kept telling me that I wouldn't be able to eat it. Also I wanted kajun (their spelling), traditional boil and garlic sauce. The waiter kept telling me I should get the trifecta (which I didn't want) and then he tells me that he has never placed an order like that (WTH?!). He then proceeded to tell another table what I ordered and they all looked at me crazy (which I found very rude and unprofesional). The order came and OMG level 4 was what I wanted and needed! Eating my snow crab and drinking my Stella I was in heaven. The waiter was shocked that I could eat and finish the crab at that level (whatever-I like hot and spicy food). Seriously why should you care what I order as long as I pay for it?! If I ever travel back to Phoenix this will be the first place that I go too but I would try and find Justin's section. \n\nSome advice: wear something you do not care about and wash your clothes immediately. I wore something I didn't care about but the smell stayed in my clothes for awhile. I had to have the hotel clean them because I couldn't take the smell anymore. Also if you go during the week early you will not have to wait. Go on a Friday night at 7:30 and you are going to wait 45-60 minutes to be seated.", 'business_id': '5D5DLnLMYiIt2ztgp6rTqA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2015-02-05', 'type': 'review'}

I have to point out that I spent a big chunk of my life living in the Mediterranean so I really love simple, off the grill, seafood or mixed with pasta and risotto, typical croatian and italian style meals. So if you are more into that then this is not the place for you. All the seafood was prepared in really heavy sauces that varied in spice and were pretty heavy on the garlic. Normally, I use garlic when cooking all the time but I dont like leaving a restaurant with my clothes smelling like im going off to chase vampires. The mussels were mixed in with really strong-flavored sausages, which kind of takes away from the beauty of eating seafood. The raw oysters were really "meat-y", it felt like I could almost choke on it and i sort of had to chew it pretty hard to be able to swallow it; all in all a very different experience. \n\nThis is definitely a "get down and dirty" kind of place; they even give you gloves! Don\'t expect utensils or anything metal or glass for that matter, even the cups are plastic. Overall the environment is okay (if you disregard the screaming servers every 10 minutes or so). I give them three stars because, overall, the seafood seemed pretty good on rare occasions when I was able to taste it from all the sauce.', 'business_id': '5D5DLnLMYiIt2ztgp6rTqA', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2015-02-06', 'type': 'review'}

We absolutely love this place. For a Friday night at 8:00, our wait was only 15 minutes. Not bad at all. For the first time, the menu is a little confusing but once the server explained it, it was on. We started with the charred oysters. They were cooked nicely,  great texture & full of flavor. We will definitely have them again. For the entr\xe9e, we ordered a pound of shrimp, a pound of mussels, a pound of snow crab legs with corn, potatoes and sausage. I didn't like that the corn, sausage & potatoes cost extra but you must do it. The sauce we chose was the trifecta medium. Before you judge, the medium is no joke. Medium my ass! It starts out mild, but because you eat so much, the burn quickly intensifies. The food was cooked to perfection and was more than enough for the two of us. It was so much, we had left overs for the next day. I rinsed off the sausage, cut it up smaller & scrambled it in eggs for breakfast. For drinks, appetizers & entr\xe9es, we got out of there for around $77 including tip. Not too bad. \nI recommend the angry crab for just you & your mate but its really good for large gatherings. Its a fun atmosphere, with awesome seafood food & plenty of laughs. We're going again tomorrow night!", 'business_id': '5D5DLnLMYiIt2ztgp6rTqA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2015-02-27', 'type': 'review'}

I ordered a pound of crawfish in the trifecta sauce on a number1 level of spicy. Having read reviews, I knew this would be plenty spicy (and I like spicy food). My friends that are bigger wusses wished they ordered a 0. The seasoning is very flavorful, unfortunately my plastic bag (how the food is brought out to you) had a leak, so be careful about the red sauce getting on your lap. A plastic bib only covers so much. I was fortunate because these crawfish were alive right before I ordered them and came out looking/tasting great. I also added some sausage to my bag (it's one kielbasa-style sausage cut into 4 pieces) which was also flavorful and made it just the right amount of food for me. Sides ordered included the sweet potato fries-ok; cajun fries-ok; and bread for my friends needing some spicy food killer. We were fortunate to not have a big wait and the food came out relatively quick. My biggest complaint would be that we needed paper towels vs the napkins provided on the table. There are a couple of wash basins to fight for when it is time to get cleaned up. Also, the table clothes are paper. Before we were all done, a bus boy came to roll up/take away half of the stuff still there on the table.

It slowly grew on us as the recipe kept improving. And by the time THIS location opened, it has been perfected! Yay! My family came in on day 2 of the opening and was pleasantly surprised to be seated within 5 minutes. Hallelujah! I celebrated my new job here and there was no better place I would have rather been. Our server was a total sweetheart. So attentive and charismatic as are almost all the servers we get when we come in. We don't come in without several pounds of shrimp in Trifecta sauce (mild or medium). The shrimp are sizable compared to their competition. The clams are always good as well but sometimes we can skip it if we don't want to go too crazy... because of course we HAVE to get the BBQ... Oh my goodness... Their brisket is SUPERB. ACQ sauce mild is the way to go. I think now their BBQ dishes comes with 2 choices of meat and we have tried their ribs but I highly recommend sticking with double brisket. BBQ also comes with 2 sides but we ALWAYS opt to substitute for cajun fries. Oh those fries... careful because you won't be able to stop eating them. We've had to get additional orders of those fries on more than 1 occasion. We have come here on weekends and weekdays on all sorts of different hours of the day but NEVER had to wait more than 5 minutes on a table. The place is huge, much bigger than the Mesa location.

I'm starting to think that they're serious about the crawfish being live & expecting me to eat it that way . I also ordered clams & there was hardly anything in my bag.. just a lot of seasoning inside the clam shells . So be careful when ordering clams or you'll jst be eating a mouth full of seasonings .\n\nMy overall experience was ehh.. okay . I just wish they would learn how to cook the crawfish better .

I had a 1lb king crab (from the Bering Sea per the waiter) @ $24/lb, added a half corn for $1, happy hour shrimp cocktail $5, happy hour calamari/clam $5, and 2 soft shell crabs for $7. Let me tell you, every single item was excellent. \n\nI was concerned the corn would be soggy, but it was just right, corn came right off the cob.  And the spice choices ranged from 0 to 5, with a 2 being jalapeno hotness.  I trusted the very friendly and knowledgeable waiter and went with zero spicy, Trifecta seasonings. It had a little spice, but I was able to taste the Cajun flavor without burning my mouth at all and that's exactly what I wanted.\n\nThe king crab was cooked perfectly. All the crab and corn came in a plastic bag carried in a bucket to the table. That was cool, I'd never had food that way.  At the bottom of the bag was the excess butter and Cajun spices which were so delicious to dip the crab in. There was more than enough at the bottom.  The waiter said to wait on asking for butter on the side because a lot came in the bag. He was spot on.\n\nThe shrimp in the shrimp cocktail was surprisingly large. Not jumbo, but not Red Lobster tiny. The shrimp was cooked perfectly, not undercooked, and chilled just right, but not frozen one bit.  The sauce, basic horseradish and ketchup, was delicious. But, the horseradish was plentiful and it cleared my nose well, but the heat only lasted a short while, not long at all.  So good!\n\nThe calamari was of good strip size. The clams were as well. The batter was a bit heavy than I'd like but overall the dish was still good. The sauce that came with this was less spicy than the cocktail sauce with the shrimp.\n\nThe crab cakes were delicious. I took them home and they were still very good. The size was as big as or bigger than most places, and the price, 2 for $7, amazing. Most places charge like $8 for 1.  One place I went charged $12 for 1.\n\nThe environment was so awesome. Very relaxed.  You get a rock to smash your crab legs. But I opted to get a nut cracker and scissors to keep down on the mess.  No silverware, so you eat with your hands.  AND they have an outside hand washing sink that was very large, with automatic soap dispensers and automatic water so you don't dirty anything beforehand, and automatic paper towel dispenser.  This idea is fantastic. Every BBQ or seafood place should have one.\n\nThe waiter was funny, let me ask as many questions as I wanted, and was very knowledgeable about the menu items. He was very accurate on descriptions and what to expect.  Very unusual for a restaurant. He was very enthusiastic about the restaurant which was great!  The manager (I think) came out to ask how everything was and he listened well and even discussed future locations which was very handy since I had to go 45 mins away to visit this location.  (It was worth the drive.)\n\nThe prices are normal or even less than many places. But worth every single penny I tell you.\n\nThis was my 1st Cajun experience and I am glad it was here, as it enlightened me to how delicious it can be.  \n\nOh, when you have a birthday they get really loud about it and enthusiastic. Not like the Olive Garden trite pretending to be enthusiastic.  Some waiter dropped a glass and it broke and it seemed every waiter and server was heckling him. :D\n\nIt was not crowded on a Wednesday night, but for some reason the parking log in this strip mall was packed.  Had to circle to find a spot.  It's in the same strip mall as Manuel's Mexican and a Starbucks and a grocery store.\n\nI definitely will be back. I even already mentioned the place to some other friends and we plan to go. I am so excited. :D\n\nForgot to mention.  The waiter notified us that our food will come out in stages. Why?  Because there are NO HEAT LAMPS, so your food comes out super super fresh when it is ready!  I love it.  It was great that it came out in phases, no waiting for everything to be ready at once, getting stagnant and soggy under heat lamps.\n\nThat is all for now that I can think of.  So delicious I tell you. What a fun experience.\n\nAdopt a pet. :)", 'business_id': '5D5DLnLMYiIt2ztgp6rTqA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2015-04-24', 'type': 'review'}

As a bartender in the neighborhood, I couldn't believe I had never heard of this place! Everything was FAR from perfect, but being in the industry I know things happen.... Candice, our server, and the male manager did what I wish every place did under the circumstances to make us happy! Thanks guys!\n   We arrived at 7:30 on Sunday and it was PACKED! There wasn't even space to grab a drink at the bar while we waited the 30 we were quoted (they text when your table is ready- how refreshing for us youngsters!) so we walked across the parking lot to another restaurant for a quick drink. We were texted at 7:40, so we rushed back over. I know that would bother a lot of people, but the restaurant cannot help when tables decide to leave, and I was super excited to try this place! We were seated in a booth with a view of the entire dining room- perfect for people watching! Candice said hi and that she'd be with us shortly immediately after we sat. This is huge to me as a bartender- I am constantly amazed at how rarely we get this tiny gesture at bars and restaurants!\n   Candice was BUSY but she handled it like a champ and gave us the lowdown and answered our questions. I ordered king crab and my husband ordered the bbq combo... this is where things could have taken a turn... Candice came back and informed us they ran out of brisket. No biggie, there's a few other meats to make up for it. A couple minutes later the nice male manager came and told me they ran out of KING CRAB! Oh nooo! This was the only crab joint of it's kind, and it's all I wanted for my birthday (they didn't know this because I avoid embarrassment at all costs)! The manager and our server were professional, apologetic, upbeat and had every intention of making us happy. They did. \n   I had the snow crab instead, which was perfect and messy and what I wanted all along, I just didn't know it, and the bbq was beyond our expectations. The mac and cheese was delish, so were the sausage, potatoes and fries. We are pretty easy going, but I thought for sure I was going to be disappointed and not want to come back... Nope.\n   I have never been treated better by a restaurant and we eat out many times a week. We usually get stereotyped as young, tatooed and probably cheap/poor, etc and not treated great.

Between the two of us, we ordered 1 pound of crawfish, shrimps, and clams with medium spicing. I would recommend asking if they have frozen or fresh crawfish. Sometimes the crawfish are frozen depending on the season. Luckily, they had fresh crawfish today! We usually get the trifecta sauce, which includes kajun, lemon pepper, & garlic.  The cajun fries are just right - crunchy on the outside & inside. If you're not into seafood, they also have a meat selection of pulled pork, brisket, ribs, and chicken.   Plastic bibs are provided. I usually tie my hair up in preparation to dig in. Plenty of napkins at the table. A bucket to dispose trash. There's also a sink outside the restroom to wash our hands.  \n\n I've been to similar places like this in CA, such as Boiling Crab & Kickin Crab.

G\'z. Manage your expectations, people!\n\nAnyway... \n\nDid a taste test between their frozen $8/lb & live crawfish $13/lb - definitely different as night & day. I\'ve had decent frozen ones multiple times at their competitor\'s restaurant so I thought that maybe theirs would be the same. WRONG! Don\'t ever order the frozen ones here. As you\'re chewing it, it has that really old smell & taste like it was frozen in the 1920s, it\'s dry & the texture is like you\'re eating a damp paper m\xe2ch\xe9. You know what I mean? Maybe this chain has a different (read: subpar) supplier of frozen crawfish -- seems the crawfish were already borderline stale before they were frozen, & not while they were still fresh. Unpleasant. Not even the trifecta sauce could mask the "unfreshness" & salvage the taste. \n\nThe live crawfish however are wow! Very tasty, delicious & tastes like how fresh crawfish should! Cooked just right so the meat retains its juiciness & decent crunch to it. And they are ginormous - like baby lobsters! (I wonder if they fed these crawfish cat... Just kidding!) Big fresh crawfish makes sucking those heads very enjoyable. Mmm. These were so huge I had a couple of heads that won\'t fit in my mouth! Ha! \n\nOrdered my crawfish with the trifecta sauce, which I\'m not sure if I really like it. It is their answer to their competitor\'s signature sauce -- which I really love (of course I am quite partial to garlic). But I couldn\'t quite figure out the taste profile of this sauce - none of the Cajun, lemon, pepper and garlic flavors stood out nor held the flavors in a tastegasmic way, & together it doesn\'t seem like they work quite well...

Plus,  their menu has tasty options beyond the boils that don\'t seem like after-thoughts ie - "Oh yeah,  let\'s put something else on the menu besides seafood boils".   Nice because boils can be a little messy. \n\nIt is no secret,  I love the little dirt Devils known to most as crawfish,  some know them as crayfish and others crawdads.   For the past 2 years,  I have had the pleasure of going between AC and HnJC for my crawfish.   Crawfish are in season from early in the year until about MID-SUMMER.  They are best,  to me, between April and late June.  The window is small considering the fact that I can eat snow crab all year long.   OK,  with that in mind,  it is mid-June and I have been to both places 3 times each since April. \n\nI have come to the conclusion that Angry Crab is the best and most consistently good establishment in Phoenix for Southern flavored seafood boils.   Every time I have gone over the past 2 years,  I have received a consistently flavorful and fresh batch of crawfish.   I order the Trifecta-hot.   There is always an adequate amount of seasoning and the seasoning has consistently tasted good and the same.  I normally add half an order of sausage and corn to go in my boil.  I Took a visiting family member their this week and she said her crab boil was the best flavored she has had in quite some time. \n\nThe nice part about AC is the "extra"  stuff on the menu is equally as good.   Po\' boy sandwiches,  char-grilled oysters (oooh lala,  delicous)  and the oyster shooter is to die for!   They also have the yummiest seasoned fries.   If you like oysters or if you like escargot, I highly recommend that you order the char-grilled oysters.  They are delicious!  You won\'t regret it.  Send me a compliment if you read my review and order them!  I\'ll just reply back, "I told you so!"  \n\nBTW: They do have BBQ.  If you read through my reviews, I only do BBQ at one establishment in PHoenix.  Their oysters are good on the barbie.  I have no clue about the other meats.\n\nKid Factor 7/10\nMy Return Factor: 100%.', 'business_id': '5D5DLnLMYiIt2ztgp6rTqA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2015-06-21', 'type': 'review'}

This should have been a tip off that the night would be headed downhill.\n\nWe told the server (Jared) that it was our first time and he welcomed and explained the menu (not too difficult to understand).  We asked for a few minutes and after about 5 minutes, we were ready and 5 minutes after that he passed by and said that he would be right back.  He then proceeded to assist and serve the table behind us for another 10 minutes or so.\n\nWhen we did get to order my girlfriend ordered the Blue Crab and he informed her that they were out of it.  Now, they either were out of it when we showed up and he didn\'t tell us or... they ran out in the 20 minutes it took us to get our order taken.  Strike one.\n\nWe both ordered a pound of shrimp with the trifecta sauce and a few potatoes and a piece of corn (they list the corn as corn on the cob but its more like half a cob).  We also ordered a piece of corn bread (pretty small but we were at least told this before ordering) and an order of mac and cheese.  The portion of the sides were pretty lack luster given the cost. Strike two.\n\nThey brought out my order and we waited for her order to come... and we waited... and waited.  It was between 15 to 20 minutes until they brought it out!

That would be like riding a bike that doesn't have tires!  Of the remaining mudbugs, I found them to be dirty in flavor.  You have to purge these things and I just think they missed that step.

The Southerner in me could not have been more thrilled to find the Angry Crab Shack off of Camelback!!\n\nThe place looks unassuming and chain\'ish from the outside, tucked away in a strip mall... but after reading the reviews here, we were ready to give it a try. There is plenty of parking, and we were there around 6PM on a Thursday, which meant no waiting for a table. The family-friendly atmosphere was apparent, as we watched kids and adults alike drawing on the walls and their tables.\n\nAs soon as I saw the menu, I knew that alligator nuggets were happening! I\'ve had them a few times before, and these were great! The flavor is a lot like chicken, while the consistency is slightly chewier (like shrimp). This is a great place to try it if you\'ve never had gator before!\n\nOne thing I\'ve really missed from home is having a good, cajun seafood boil, and WOW did this place deliver!!! We ordered the veggies, mussels, snow crab and shrimp, with the trifecta flavoring and a spice level of "2" on a 0-5 scale. I\'m a spice-lover, and this was just right for me! The crab legs were a hands-down stand out, and the mussels weren\'t far behind! We loved the shrimp and veggies too, but agreed that next time, we\'d probably forego them for more of our favorites! The consumption process is (as with all good boils!) a little messy, so we just poured it out on the table and went to town! (Maybe don\'t dump all of the sauce, but the rest is fine on the butcher paper.) We stuffed ourselves, enjoying every bite!! It was well-complimented by my Abita purple haze, which I was happy to find on draft. The butcher paper and sink on the side of the room made for an easy post-meal clean up, so that in no time, we were sitting at a nice, tidy table again.\n\nWe\'ll definitely be back soon, and next time, I\'ll add some red potatoes to the bag!

In addition, the Hurricane was authentic and very good. \n\nOn the downside the food was not only bland, the dungeness crab we ordered was terrible. It was both watery and rubbery which is obviously not what you want in your seafood. The crawfish we ordered (we ordered the fresh version, not flash frozen) was also not good. Nothing was cooked in to flavor the food. It was like something was quickly removed from a boiler and then thrown into a plastic bag with a bunch of goop and shaken up. In addition, the two Po Boys we ordered to go (we love real Po-Boys) were flat out inedible and we got home took a few bites and ended up throwing them away. \n\nAfter spending $100 and not expecting anything great, we got well below even mediocre and my wife ending up heating up a pizza when we got home.

I tried to snap a couple pictures but when everyone's too busy wolfing down the food and your hands, maybe forearms, are covered in trifecta sauce, things get a little difficult.\n\nFor the three of us, we got: 2lbs of shrimp, 1lb of mussels, 1lb of clams, 1lb of blue crab, and vegetables, all in trifecta sauce at a hot (level 3).  I loved the sauce - it definitely had a good kick to it but I might give level 5 a shot next time cause I mean who doesn't love a little challenge?  The veggies were okay, but next time I'll probably give it a skip and stick to the corn and potatoes instead.  Similarly for the mussels and clams, I mean there was a lot of shell.  I know, I didn't think this through, but probably half the bag was shell and I would've much rathered more meat.  Shrimp was a solid first choice for me, with crab coming in at a close second.  If you couldn't tell, I've got my next visit all planned out.\n\nThe boyfriend's mom doesn't care for seafood in general so she ordered 1/2lb of pulled pork.

The service is great, the food is great and the overall atmosphere of the place is great! We were a party of four and was greeted and seated very fast. No waiting in line around 5pm. (Just FYI the line was forming around 7pm) They do have a happy hour for appetizers and drinks in the bar area, and drinks only in the main dining ($1.00 off all drinks). We had Ashley and she was great. She was always refilling our drinks and she was very personable. She made the whole experience enjoyable. The seafood was out of this world. It was excellent. Our party shared a 1.5 lb lobster, 1 lb mussels, 1lb snow crab and 1lb shrimp. You order by the pound, add your seasonings (highly recommend the TRIFECTA) and the amount of heat (level 2 was perfect). The food was hot, tasty, and cooked to perfection.

She took excellent care of us all night. We ordered: 4 pounds of shrimp, two pound of mussels, two pounds of snow crab, a full rack of rib and a pound of catfish. We also got Gator bites and Cajun Fries plus a couple of red potatoes. After two rounds of drinks it came to $220 or about $37 per person plus tip. We had a lot of leftovers. \n\nI had the Gator and Snow Crab. Since I ordered my crab with '#3 hot' sauce, Alexa recommended I get my gator in buffalo sauce. It was better that way. The crab was boiled in a bag (like all other non-BBQ dishes) and the seasoning was added in. Great flavor. The shrimps came unpeeled as well. \n\nMessy but good. It was very loud in the ACS and there were a lot of celebrations going on, so we just shouted thru our meal. \n\nGood, fun place to go but not on date-night: too messy and too loud.", 'business_id': '5D5DLnLMYiIt2ztgp6rTqA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2015-09-11', 'type': 'review'}

They have the seafood boils which you can make your own by picking what kind of sauce, what level of spiciness and how much (if any) corn, sausage or potatoes you want in it.  They also have the barbeque which was as good as the seafood boil we got.  There's more sides and po boys etc you can get too but we didn't get that far.\n\nWe got the 2 meat platter with baby back ribs and brisket.  It would've been solid at a barbeque restaurant!  The sides could be a little better.. we got the beans and cole slaw.  They were decent but lacked a bit of flavor.  I loved that they served it with a thick piece of white bread!\n\nFor the seafood boil we got the crawfish with trifecta sauce to medium spiciness.  It was just perfect!  Next time we'll probably try it with shrimp though because there's not a lot of pay off for meat there.  I learned later you're supposed to get like 2-3 lbs crawfish per person.\n\nI absolutely love this place.  It's so fun and the pricing's actually reasonable.

Reminds me of Florida where I lived for 14 years and going back to next week for good. The d\xe9cor the set-up of the restaurant reminds me of Florida. Most of all the food reminds me of Florida. I had 2 servings of the raw oysters, the brisket/rib combination with corn and baked beans and it was soooo good! The brisket literally melts in your mouth when you bite into it. I had the jalapeno (level 2) sauce and it gave it that extra kick which really set off the flavor of the meat. My GF had the salmon with rice and hush puppies. The salmon was pretty close to perfect with white rice and came with coleslaw. All was really good. Our server was Lexie (?) who was very knowledgeable and accommodating and believed in the product she was selling. For being on the job for a week she was very professional and knew her job.

Here, you buy the seafood by the pound, if you think you want a veggie, you add it, if you really think you have room for potatoes, add them.

We waited approximately 45 minutes to be seated, however, it was a very busy night, so the wait wasn\'t totally unexpected. Our waiter was great--he was very funny, animated, and attentive. So far so good, and the evening is off to a great start. We ordered the shrimp and mussels in trifecta sauce, as well as calamari and hush puppies. The latter two were delicious, and the shrimp and mussels were good, but certainly nothing to rave about. \n\nAfter dinner, we went to our friend\'s house to hang out for a bit. Shortly after we arrived, my husband\'s stomach started rumbling so loud that I thought he was joking and playing a soundbite from his phone. No--it was his stomach making all that noise. Seriously, it was so LOUD I could hear it when I stepped into the other room to grab my phone. That continued for about 10 minutes while my poor husband just sat there with an embarrassed look on his face. What he didn\'t realize, however, was that his embarrassment was about to grow exponentially. He was telling a story, and mid-sentence, stood up and hurriedly headed to the restroom. Myself and our friend excused ourselves to the other room further away from the guest bathroom so he\'d have a little privacy. Pardon the graphic nature of this review, but he had horrific diarrhea that, to quote him, "just wouldn\'t stop."\n\nA short time after he resurfaced from the bathroom, MY STOMACH STARTED TO MAKE THE SAME LOUD GRUMBLING NOISES! I only lasted about two minutes after the grumbling began before I was forced to run off to the bathroom to suffer a similar fate. \n\nWe were both absolutely mortified having had this experience at our friend\'s house. We decided it was best to head home. I barely made it through the door before I had another bout. And then ANOTHER that woke me from sleep in the middle of the night. And then ANOTHER in the morning. I was SO SICK! \n\nThat following day, I called the restaurant to speak to a manager, who was busy and could not come to the phone. I was, however, promised a call back "right away." No one bothered to return my call.\n\nFast forward a couple days later. I called back and was able to get a hold of a manager, who added insult to injury by accusing me of lying because I couldn\'t locate our receipt right that moment. When I located the receipt a few minutes later and offered to email him a copy or provide him with any details from the receipt over the phone, he scoffed and made an off-color comment about how their location seems to attract "broke" customers who don\'t want to pay their bill, as well as other "undesirables." He then proceeded to pronounce my last name with a ridiculous, over-the-top accent. When I corrected him, he repeated it twice more, each time more exaggerated than the last.\n\nAs a side note, this absolutely HORRIFIC experience took place in JUNE 2015--four months ago! Every time I sat down to write this review I would get so upset thinking about it that I had to stop and leave it for another time.', 'business_id': '5D5DLnLMYiIt2ztgp6rTqA', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2015-10-27', 'type': 'review'}

She was sweet, informative and prompt. \n\nOn our second time here we came for my man's birthday and it was not as pleasant of an experience, unfortunately. Our servers (Brandon and his trainee, didn't catch her name) were great. Fast and friendly! Food? Still unreal. This time we had five pounds of seafood, multiple shots and cocktails. This is where things went sour for us. Problem number one: we asked for two Irish car bombs and they came out as two full beers and they were short on shot glasses so one shot was in a plastic cup (no big deal) but how am I supposed to chug a bomber short with a full beer?!!! Weird, but nothing to be upset about really. Next I ordered two of the same type of drink, the Dixie Peach, but since I CANNOT drink tequila I asked for mine with vodka. When they came out the girl who dropped them off was not our waitress, so I asked which was vodka and which was tequila, to which she had no clue. So I smelled and tasted both, as well as my boyfriend and they we're definitely both tequila, so we sent one back with no more than two sips depleted. The bartender, Miranda, proceeded to come over and pretty much argue with us that one was vodka. Look, I don't want anything comped, I'm not looking for q handout. I just want the drink I ordered!! I was offended that I was being argued with over something so easily fixable. I work at a bar and I give impeccable customer service, and I've never even considered arguing with a customer, even if I thought they were wrong! \n\n\nOverall this place is unbelievable! Brandon and his trainee are fabulous and deserve to be rewarded for their candor. I wish I could give it five stars but service is a priority to the fullest to me. And sadly today I have to dock a star for the bartender's attitude toward the situation. \n\n\nThe manager, Derek, was super kind when we brought it up to him.

We went in about 4 PM which was a perfect time, no a lot of folks yet.  In fact, maybe 3 tables...  We were greeted by Shelby, our server for the evening.  She was kind enough to share the process, since this was our first time.  Just know up front, the whole shell fish (Lobster & Dungeness crabs are on average 1.5 lbs and up)  Well, we ended up ordering a lot of different things, so we could try, everything we ordered for the steamed/boil had the Trifecta Sauce (Kajun, Lemon Pepper & Garlic) with Spice level 2 (Medium-sizzlin).  We ended up with Dungeness Crab, Lobster, Shrimp (Jumbo size) & Crawfish (jumbo size) and added sausage, potatoes and corn on the cob.  We also added, the Catfish Dinner and Hush puppies; needless to say, we took a lot of food home.  The season blend/combo we selected was so tasty and flavorful.  Everything penetrated the shell fish well and the season on top of the shells was so good you couldn't help but suck/lick (sounds dirty, but not meaning to) the shells.  The additional (sausage, potatoes & corn on the cob) that were steamed in carried the flavor well too.  The catfish was corn meal coated and fried to perfection.  It was light, fish was flaky...I would be happy just having the fried catfish dinner alone.  It came with some kajun seasoned fries and those were good too and I'm not a fan usually of seasoned fries.  The hush puppies were ok, they had a nice balance of heat/flavor, but a little too dough or dense for me.  Again, our server was Shelby, a very friendly person and very good about sharing information...which is great if you have never been here.  She was very attentive, I don't think our iced teas were ever low.  The restaurant is very clean and orderly and all tables have the basics, napkins and heavy butcher type paper as table cloths (trust me, it's a good thing and needed if you order from fresh market).  They even have a wash sink in the dining area for you to clean yourself up afterwards, so cool....As we wrapped up our meal, it was starting to fill up and folks waiting; so timing is everything.", 'business_id': '5D5DLnLMYiIt2ztgp6rTqA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2015-12-06', 'type': 'review'}
