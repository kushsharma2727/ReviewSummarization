They had fried plantains, and they do Asian food better than any buffet I\'ve been to (which isn\'t saying that much, but is saying something).', 'business_id': '8zL3V6rmFKBess3bxPLAoQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2008-03-18', 'type': 'review'}

Anyway, the lack of a long line typical of Sunday  mornings should have been a major red flag.  We had a time constraint so we waited 15 minutes and settled for brunch here at the price of $24.95.  \nI'm not sure about the other buffets, but you could also get free mimosas with your brunch here.  \n\nThere was a lot of selection with a variety of Chinese, sushi, breakfast, salad, dessert, gelato, and meats.  I avoid all sushi for the most part at buffets, and for good reason, too; my friend decided to try a couple of pieces found the rice to be stale with meager portions of fish.  \n\nMost of the food was mediocre, but the oatmeal was good.  I was also surprised with the har gow and how it tasted like something I could get from Rowland Heights.  I was excited about the gelato case but in the middle of my chocolate gelato, I found a chunk of ice, aka the deal breaker.\n\nI must say that the lady who served our table was very courteous and attentive.

I think I have found my new favorite buffet in Las Vegas. Move aside Spice Market (PH/Aladdin) and Bellagio Buffet (the two other top buffets on the Las Vegas strip IMO)....Cravings is where it's at. Very short or even no line (didn't really matter for us either way because we had line passes as guests of the hotel) that immediately puts Cravings a step ahead of Spice Market and Bellagio Buffet where the line waits would easily be 30-60 minutes.   Pricing for dinner was under $30 which I think puts it right on par with Spice Market and cheaper than Bellagio.\n\n  Food quality and variety. I think Cravings actually had way more variety than any other buffet I've seen. Gyros, Wonton noodle soup, salads, soups, ice cream...whoops I mean GELATO!!!, desserts, pasta, pizza, and of course prime rib and all you can eat Alaskan king crab legs. Now how's the quality...okay I'm going to put the quality of their food somewhere between Bellagio and Spice Market Buffet. Which for the same price as Spice Market is a damn good deal.\n\n  Service also was excellent, even considering our party of eight. Atmosphere, ambience and cleanliness also felt right on par with Bellagio. I'll admit Spice Market feels a bit dingy, but Cravings had a nice atmosphere to it.\n\n  Anyway with all said above. Cravings is now my #1 buffet in Las Vegas. Good price, no line, excellent variety and quality of food, good service, and nice atmosphere.

The other things were a little... off.\n\nThe Lamb osso Buco was soft enough that it would just fall off the bone, and it had a good flavor to it- not really gamey.  This went along well with the sauteed buttered wild mushrooms in the italian section of the buffet.\n\nThe Flank steak goes well with the port demi (which is alongside the porkloin wrapped in bacon, which didn't taste all that great...)  \n\nThere was also the Ceviche, which was waaaayy too sour, and not enough spice.  The Cioppino was really salty and super mini-shrimped.  They also had dim sum (which was bland) and sushi (which had meat which didn't look so tasty so I didn't try it).  I don't remember much of the other things because they didn't taste good.\n\nHands down the best thing from this buffet was the dessert!  Their mini pecan pies and mini lemon meringue were really good.

You pick your ingredients, and a friendly cook will prepare it before your eyes. \n\nThe breakfast section is blah. Pancakes and french toasts were tasteless. \n\nThe salad bar was also fun. You pick whatever you want and they mix them up for you.\n\nThey also offered 2 kinds of meats (ham and prime rib) at the carving station. I believe there were also the Chinese section where they had below average dim sum and Latin section to which I didn't pay much attention.\n\nThe highlight of my meal was the crepe. The peach crepe was heavenly. I would go back just for the crepe. So soft, creamy, sweet but not overly sweet. mmmmmmmmmmmm ~~~~~~~\n\nI am not a doughnut fan, but i was very impressed by it.

I was NOT dissapointed with the salad bar, but I was with the fact that some lady tosses it together for you. She put a paltry amount of lettuce in the bowl but topped it with waaaay too many toppings and too much dressing. I had to ask her to add more lettuce. Good thing I did because even with the extra lettuce there was still too much everything else. Sheesh. \n\nThe eggplant parmesan and the pesto pasta were surprisingly good. As good as I have made at home. The cab legs were scary and gross. I put it on my mans plate when he wasn't looking. \n\nThe rest of the buffet left something to be desired. Too bad.

I have been there several times before and have enjoyed my experience.  With that being said, I gave it 3 stars based on my most recent visit (2/20/10).  I don't know if it was because the last couple of times I went there I was starving or if the food really was good, but compared to my previous visits this time was a bummer.\n\nThe buffet is set up with several different stations resembling regions in cuisines.  There's Italian, Rotisserie, Carving, Chinese, Fishmonger (fish), Japanese, soups, salads, sandwich, and desserts.  The Rotisserie, Carving, Chinese, and Japanese are usually good.  \n\nThis trip I had Carving, Fish, Chinese and Japanese.  At the Carving station I had Prime Rib w/ Au Jus sauce, mashed potatoes, and herb-roasted potatoes.  At the Fish station I tried the grilled cod.  At the Chinese I tried their various forms of shu mai (w/ shrimp and pork), fried rice, chow mein, and sweet & sour pork.  And at the Japanese station I tried their sushi.  There were some high points and some low points...\n\n+ = prime rib was rare and juicy (the way I like it), the shu mai (especially the shrimp) was excellent, the sweet & sour pork was tender with just the right kick of sweet and sour, the deep fried salmon hand roll was a surprise because of the crunchiness of the deep fried salmon, DESSERT STATION!\n\n- = the fried rice was overcooked, it was hard and bland, the sushi station was kind of pathetic\n\nBottom Line = Like I said before, I am a fan and will most definitely try this buffet again, however, this most recent trip was not as memorable.  I think the best part of the meal/buffet was the dessert station.  I loved that they serve gelato ice cream.  Very creamy and tasty.

We got in at 2:30, just in time to grab the last of the Brunch food and then stay until 3pm to get the dinner menu, and all for the brunch price! YAY! \n\nThe presentation at this place is pretty cool. They have fish tanks with fishes swimming around over the raw fish section. LOTS of carving stations and make your own stuff. There is an entire selection just for salad where they will make you any salad you want! There is, of course, all the sections one would expect from a buffet: Chinese, Sushi, Fish, Italian, Mongolian, Rotisserie, Mexican... \n\nThe most interesting thing about this place: the variety of foods. Normally when one sees an Italian section, what does one expect? Pizza, lasagna, generic pasta, right? Well, at Cravings, you get one or two generic buffet items, but then you get two or three very unique items that I have never seen at a buffet before. the Italian section had rack of lamb and garlic parmesan chicken. The Mexican section had fajitas, posole, and even some weird looking sauce / soup thing that I had never heard of before. The Chinese section did not have gross Panda Express food, it had szechuan beef, shrimp fried rice, egg rolls, and a chicken dish authentic to China. How cool is that? \n\nThe dessert selection is enormous and they have two entire shelves of sugar free items for diabetics. Thumbs up! Now I can stuff my face with food and control my blood sugar with sugar free dessert. They also had fruit, mini chocolate and banana cream pies, fresh chocolate chip cookies, and slices of every kind of pie and cake you can imagine. \n\nI knock off two stars for a couple of reasons. One, it is pricey ($18.95 plus tax for brunch) and two, the unique food selections force you to be adventurous. Sometimes trying new foods is not a good experience. There were a few items on my plate that did not taste good at all, and that sucks when you go to a premium buffet like this one.', 'business_id': '8zL3V6rmFKBess3bxPLAoQ', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2010-05-05', 'type': 'review'}

They have fresh omelletes made there, and breakfast pizzas, tons of meat, sausages, bacon, fruit, yogurt, bagels, cheese, etc.  The only thing that stopped me from giving it was 5 star was the staff.  We went there on a Monday morning.  Our first server forgot the milk that my wife ordered and I had to hunt her down after seeing here walk pass us a few times without the milk in sight.  Then after half an hour, another server took over and I finished my first glass of orange juice so I asked him for another glass.  He went into the kitchen for about 5 minutes and then came out a bunch of juice containers and walked off into the other side of the restaurant.  I gave up on the OJ and we left.  Also another thing was the women at the cheese/deli meat station.  The salmon plate was almost finished so an older European gentlemen politely asked her to change it saying " the salmon looks sad, can you change it please?" and she walked away to another side that I was close to and while she was unpacking a new salmon plate, I could hear her mumble, "the only thing sad here is you".  I would expect better service at such a nice hotel but obviously they\'ve gotta better train their buffet staff.

My experience here was not what I expected.  After being a loyal customer at the Buffet @ Bellagio, I expected greatness after being named one of the top buffets on the strip.  What I CAN say about this place is that they have the best asian food I\'ve tasted from international buffets such as cravings.  They had wonton soup, a beef noodle soup, and spring rolls!  I\'ve never seen these options on a strip buffet so I was impressed.  The quality was good tho not as good as authentic asian food of course.  But their asian options by far exceeded other buffets of its kind.  The dessert selection was great.  Loved the gelato and the macaroons!!  I couldn\'t stop myself from getting seconds and thirds.  \n\nThe prime rib was inconsistent.  Some slices were good and others were dry and unappetizing.  I think that the food here is solid and gives you a diversity of dishes that you don\'t find at other buffets on the strip.

Add some scallions and cilantros and you are definitely good to go here!)\n\nCrepe station:  Fresh peach / peach cream crepe.... wow!  One of the best  crepes I've had in a while as the cream reminded me of Beard Papa's except is a little bit tarty..... but not overly sweet and just right...  Crepes were made to perfection so it turned out awesome!  Had to share it with everyone though.. couldn't finish this large chunk of heaven!\n\nSalad station:  Skipped this because I was getting really full, but noticed that they had fresh made Paninis if requested.... so for those of you who like to take a little snack out of the buffet for later.. this option would be great as those sandwiches looked healthy and wonderful!  I'll give it a try next time!\n\nDessert station:  By this time I'm ready to faint..... but had to pull myself to take a look.... took a sugar free cheesecake and that's about it... not bad.....  Had to end the meal with ice cream though... so grapefruit gelato was on my menu to clean up my palate.....\n\nCravings...... I can't crave you anymore for today.... maybe another time.....", 'business_id': '8zL3V6rmFKBess3bxPLAoQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2010-08-25', 'type': 'review'}

LOL...this was my fiance and I at about 1:30PM on Sunday morning (well afternoon I guess, but it felt like morning).\n\nAfter an incredible "Vegas style" Saturday night - all we knew was we were still tired, and still starving from the night before.  We also knew we had to get up eventually.  How were we going to combat this beer hangover?  How about mass quantities of food.\n\nLet me preface by saying - we aren\'t the buffet types AT ALL.  If we\'re going to spend money on food, we go for quality over quantity. We\'d find it much easier to spend $100 on a sushi dinner, or an amazing Chinese banquet, than a buffet.  But again, my yelp research had led me to Cravings.  Not because it\'s the best.  Not because it\'s the cheapest. But because of it\'s Asian selection.  We knew we were in Vegas.  We knew we needed a ton of food.  But we also knew we needed Asian.  And it needed to be fast.  We were in no condition to wait in a massive line.  And it needed to be on the strip.  What the heck - Cravings it is!\n\nWe got to the Mirage at about 2PM, (let me also tell you that the strip anytime on the weekends is a PARKING lot.  We did not take Las Vegas Blvd once while we were there).  We found a spot by the elevators to the Mirage and entered the tropical paradise.  I already began feeling better (it HAS to be the casino air) - and the beautiful gardens really helped brighten the mood.  But this is not a review of the Mirage.\n\nWe walked through the gardens and casino, passed the Cirque Du Soleil Revolution Theater and Lounge (looked SOO cool, if only there was more time)...passed Kokomo\'s Steak House...Passed Japonais...and finally, we made it to  Cravings!  It was seriously like a light shone from above on the restaurant sign.  It was at the end of the casino (really..NOT that far of a walk, just REALLY far when you\'re still hungover and starved).  The BEST thing EVER was seeing that, there was NO line.  Seriously - none.  I had read horror stories about two hour lines at Bellagio, and wasn\'t about to have it.  This was perfect for us.\n\nCost for Sunday brunch with Champagne with tax was only $56.10 for two!  That included bottomless mimosas/champagne and soft drinks/coffee. Okay, that may seem like a lot - but REALLY, when you consider your dining options on the strip - you can either go fast food cheap, and settle for McDonald\'s or Panda Express, you could go fine dining and pay $100 for lunch, or you could do a buffet - which includes champagne.  We were happy with our decision.\n\nService was great for us - although, I CAN see where other yelpers may have had issues with this.  We were very lucky - we started off with a subpar server, but during the brunch/dinner shift change, we were replaced with a wonderful server who always kept our glasses full (trust me - my fiance probably consumed 10 iced teas in 20 minutes) and my champagne always full.  Champagne was a nice touch (even though I had complained of a hangover only ten minutes before).\n\nOnto the food.  REALLY - the ONLY reason you should come here is if you like Asian food.  Seriously - I don\'t think this buffet would appeal to customers who do not like Asian food.  There is a section called "Noodles" that serves shumai, steamed pork buns, and potstickers, reminiscent of dim sum.  At that same station you can order beef and meatball pho, wonton noodle soup, and many other varieties of soup and dishes.  And then next to that is a "chinese" section that has noodles, rice, congee, and a variety of other Chinese dishes.  And next to that is a Japanese section (with a very small variety of sushi and to be honest, not really good sushi).  But they do have miso soup which is soo soothing.\n\nThe pho is good (not the best broth ever) but it does the trick!  The wonton noodle soup was really good, and the congee as well.  We must\'ve loaded up on all of the soups.  The shumai is okay - it just depends on when you go.  It was a bit chewy but when they put out a super fresh batch and it was fine.  \n\nAll in all a very pleasant experience.  So much so we went back for dinner the following night.  No champagne - but the same price - $56.10 for two - not bad for dinner!  And the variety was better - singapore noodles, shrimp and veggies.  And their prime rib was amazing.  Seriously soo tender.  \n\nI would highly recommend this buffet if you like Asian food.  And their "carving" station is good too.  My fiance sampled the crab legs and said they seemed frozen and salty.  We only stuck to Asian, soups, and meat.  We didn\'t even hit dessert!\n\nYou get what you pay for - and you ARE at a buffet.  I wasn\'t expecting New York Chinatown or SF Chinatown quality food, but it was a wonderful variety (and yes - there were Asians cooking behind the stations!)  Haha.  If you\'re looking for a reasonable buffet with NO lines I\'d definitely stop here.  Maybe not the quality of desserts or french cuisine as the Bellagio or the Wynn, but not nearly as pricey either!', 'business_id': '8zL3V6rmFKBess3bxPLAoQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2010-09-08', 'type': 'review'}

We were there at about 8pm on a Saturday night.  There was no line, which probably should have been an indication that it wasn\'t great, but at that point we had been looking for the "perfect" buffet and were just tired of searching.\n\nThey had a wide variety of categories to choose from: Italian, carved meat, Latin, Mediterranean, Seafood, Sushi, Chinese and Salad.  However, within each category was the most basic of each food.  \n\nItalian: Pizza, pastas with either marinara or alfredo sauces.

I strongly recommend getthing the chipotle mashed potatoes though.\n\n(Note: If you want the perfect plate, get a slice of prime rib, a side of chipotle mashed potatoes with turkey gravy, a made-to-order salad from the salad bar, and some corn bread. So. Good.)\n\nThe sushi station was measly and didn't even look good enough to try though. I've seen better looking sushi at Chinese buffets. \n\nOh, but the desert station! Little pies!! I'm a weirdo for mini versions of things, like some girls. They had mini Dutch Apple Pie, mini raspberry pie (filling had souffle consistency) mini pecan pie, and a mini peanut butter pie. They were all scrumptious and adorable! The passion fruit infused cake with orange and strawberry slices on top was both aesthetically pleasing and subtly sweet. The strawberry gelato was very, very bold flavored and the cookies and cream flavor was a miss. The chocolate one was probably the best.\n\nThe service was not that great. It shouldn't be a big deal for a buffet if the waiters are good or not but the tables were kind of small and the plates were huge so it was noticeable when we'd been unattended for half an hour and even the ice in my water is gone. Because I ate my ice cubes as a form of hydration. Bad bad baaaaaaad.\n\nThe setting was pretty nice, contemporary American theme going and the stations had their respective titles above them to keep from having lines and long wait times to get food. \n\nI would go again, if there were coupons or I'd try that tip to go for lunch prices but dinner items.", 'business_id': '8zL3V6rmFKBess3bxPLAoQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2011-01-11', 'type': 'review'}

However, our stay in Las Vegas was this time with the Mirage, so we ended up going to Cravings after all.  We went there for lunch and paid 18.50 per person, which is an ok price.  Unless you\'re looking to go to McDonalds or another fast food chain restaurant, that\'s about the price you\'ll end up paying per person for a decent meal anywhere around here, so it wasn\'t too daunting.\nI ended up giving Cravings 3 stars, based on my findings below.\n\nFirst of all, service was excellent.  I\'d rate it 5 stars if I could separate service & food stars.  Our drinks were always filled, in fact, most of the time we\'d barely emptied half our glasses before the waitress/attendant came and topped off the drink.  Also, our plates were promptly cleaned up once we were done with a course, and the waitresses/waiters & greeters were VERY friendly.  \nSo kudos to the staff @ Cravings, keep up the good work.\n\nLet\'s move on to what we\'re here for.... food!  I think the easiest way to rate and comment on this would be station by station.\n\nMexican/Latin Foods - very disappointing.  In fact, my husband even asked if there truly was a Mexican chef there or if they\'d hired a British chef to handle the Latin food.  (No offense to British chefs out there that are good at all types of cuisines.... he was just playing off stereotypes, obviously.... Gordon Ramsay probably cooks better Mexican food than any Latin chef out there ;-))\nANYWAY, the plantains - huge disappointment. I love plantains, I was very excited to see them but the taste was off.  The enchiladas were not very good either, and I didn\'t attempt the taco fixings but I\'m assuming those were ok since theres not much to prepare in way of cooking those...\n\nBBQ - fairly tasty! :-)  They redeem themselves some!! I had a wonderful veal brisket with a tangy BBQ sauce on the side.  The sweet potato salad w/spicy mustard was also good.   They had a cornbread "pie" which was awesome, very smooth, and their BBQ beans were great.  I\'m definitely a fan of the BBQ section of "Cravings".\n\nCarving Station - Two thumbs up!! I had the thickest, juciest slices of turkey on my plate and they were not cheap on the servings, I was a very happy camper while endulging in the delights of the carving station.\n\nChinese - Meh.  Middle of the road, not a big selection of good stuff, but enough to satisfy any craving for Asian foods.  Nice eggrolls.\n\nSushi - I\'ll have to rely on my husband for this review as I\'m not a big fan of sushi.  He said it was great, he complemented the Sushi chefs... the sushi were just the right size and they had a good variety.\n\nSalad bar - Awesome! Great selection of fresh cold cuts! \n\nFishmonger/Raw bar - no comment, didn\'t visit those so I can\'t judge, however the selection was not very good and whatever they had there, didn\'t look too tempting....\n\nItalian - Middle of the road, ok selection of pizzas.\n\nDessert -  Pretty tasty.  Best Napoleon Cake I\'ve tasted in a long time! Also their chocolate mousse was fantastic, with chunks of chocolate bites in there, and the bread pudding was also very good.  Nice selection of sugar free desserts as well, and they tasted good... not "sugar free"\n\nAll in all though, I must say you can find better buffets in Vegas for less... I probably won\'t be choosing Cravings in the future.', 'business_id': '8zL3V6rmFKBess3bxPLAoQ', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2011-02-18', 'type': 'review'}

And even when it took a back seat to fancier, pricier, and more popular offerings from newer resorts such as Bellagio, Paris, and the Wynn, it still held its own as an excellent above average Vegas buffet. As recently as one or two years ago, Cravings offered a great dining experience. While you didn't get more upscale items like seared ahi or beef wellington, you did get a wide selection of food that was delicious and fresh. I recall prime rib that was juicy and tender, mounds of moist crab legs, and steaming entree selections. Well, not anymore.\n\nNow things have gone noticeable downhill. The prime rib which I remembered so fondly was overcooked. My piece of medium prime rib had hardly any pink left in it and no juices running out of it when I cut into it. I can't imagine what a piece of the well done would have tasted like. The crab legs looked a bit dried out and only enough was put out throughout the evening to cover the ice underneath. A lot of the the other meats offered at various stations were also a bit overcooked. Knowing that buffets typically undercook their food slightly (since the heat from the steam trays and lamps finish the job) it suggests that the cooks were not careful with their technique or that the food was just sitting out for too long. \n\nMany food items were not being replenished or refreshed as often as they should have. The two bowls of ceviche I wanted to try were half empty, with much of the seafood already picked out of it. It remained this way for the entire duration of my meal. The hand rolls at the sushi station were replenished sporadically. And meager allowances of crab legs on the ice tray left me feeling like I was constantly picking through leftovers.\n\nService at the tables was adequate, but service at the food stations was detached and unfriendly, with hardly a smile to be found. I also had to make three trips to the gelato station before finding someone to offer me a scoop.\n\nTo be fair, none of the food at Cravings was bad enough be inedible or unpalatable. At a lesser buffet in a lesser hotel, it might have been passable. However, at $26.99 for a buffet at the Mirage (Bellagio was only a few dollars extra this weeknight) I expected more in terms of quality, freshness, and service.", 'business_id': '8zL3V6rmFKBess3bxPLAoQ', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2011-08-18', 'type': 'review'}

Wide variety of foods here, but fast forward to 2008 and beyond, where the Cravings Buffet has expanded and vastly improved. There is quite an international feel to the buffet, ranging from Americano to Mexicano to Asian (Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese). Lots of cut meats to choose from and plenty of soups to try! Desserts included cakes, tarts, bread pudding, and a gelato bar! Drinks are free, so drink up if you're into fruit juices: orange, cranberry, apple, etc. Service was great too, as they servers regularly cleaned our tables and refilled our drinks. The food is arrayed around the the dining area in a wide circular arc, making you walk a bit to find your favorite foods (a little exercise within the buffet compound). Not a bad buffet in Las Vegas.

My girlfriend paid, so I didn\'t see the cost til it was too late.  That put a bit of a damper on things, because I was ticked from the get-go.  I don\'t even want to say what we paid, because it\'s embarrassing.  We really should have walked out and gone to STK or something, it wouldn\'t have been much more.\n\nSo, let\'s start with the "good": Our server was VERY nice!  She was a doll and should really be serving somewhere better.  The pot-stickers and shrimp/pork dumplings were edible.  In fact, with a little Sriracha, they were pretty good.  The chilled shrimp and crab legs, on this day, were perfect.  The legs weren\'t huge but they were nicely split and easy to access the meat, so it made them easy to eat.  I really should have just stopped there.  OH, actually, the prime rib was decent.  Actually, when we got some fresh out of the over, it was really tasty.  Cooked just right, amazingly enough.  There, I should have stopped there.\n\nThe "bad": The chinese food was crap.  Worst garlic beef, ever.  Chewy, nasty pieces of meat and the sauce was like gelatin.  The breakfast options must have been sitting out for hours.  The eggs had a crust on them 1/2" thick.  I couldn\'t even force myself to get any.  The bacon had been sitting for a while too and had gotten soggy.  HOW does bacon get soggy???  And the desserts?  If it wasn\'t for some OK gelato, I would have gone all Hulk on this place for the crap desserts.  The chocolate cheesecake actually made me physically sad.  And then the "key lime pie" made me really mad.  Bah, I don\'t want to talk about this anymore, it\'s just depressing me.\n\nMy recommendation, avoid the buffets.  Unless it\'s at a very high end establishment and they have freshly prepared food items, it\'s just not worth it.  Oh, and it wrecked me, my girlfriend and her kids for two days.

The food is still good and though it has long since been eclipsed in variety and quality by others across the Strip, what struck me today was how few of the staff bother to smile at the guests, and none more so than the staff tending the actual buffets. Indeed one whose name I noted was Bernard (an elderly chinese or other asian) was irritated that I had asked for a slice of prime rib as he was busy filling a bowl of horse radish. He made me wait until he was finished and then quickly sliced a dry piece which he flung on to my plate. Another staffer (an african american man, late forties/fifties, didn't catch his name) looking after the breakfasty items (this was their midweek brunch service) ignored a question I had and disappeared off inside. Sure the rest of the reviewers are right here - there was no line and the food was solid. But the key to hospitality is not just about product, but more importantly about making people feel at home. The Mirage has lost that quality from 20 years ago when it was fully staffed by professionals who remembered the golden era of Vegas and had been chosen by leadership because of their interpersonal skills. I question if Mirage leadership, certainly at the buffet restaurant, is being as critical now. Remember, this isn't a cheap meal at $23-24 and the Mirage is still deemed a four star brand. Not sure if Mirage leadership look at reviews like this but the staffer details are included for them - for the rest of the readership, I do suggest that there could be several reasons why some buffets have long lines and the Mirage has no line.", 'business_id': '8zL3V6rmFKBess3bxPLAoQ', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2012-06-28', 'type': 'review'}

My slice of prime rib was full of fatty pockets, my steamed rice was stale and hard. I mean, seriously, how does one go about messing up steamed rice?? The pizza was flavorless with crust like cardboard and sauce that tasted like ketchup with basil in it. You could find better quality food at Jack in the Box at 3 in the morning on a tuesday night.\n\nThe one good thing I can say about this place is that our waiter, Dan was very nice and our drinks were always filled.

My favorite part of the buffet is the seafood section because I'm such a huge fan of the big shrimp cocktail and the king crab legs!! \n\nMmm mm TASTY!!...\n\nThe sushi section offers 4 different kinds of handrolls (Tuna, Salmon, Yellowtail and Scallops), and 3 different kinds of Japanese salad, Soybeans, cut rolls and miso soup.\n\nMeat section offers Turkey, Roast Beef, Prime Rib, Barbeque and other stuff. Then they have the Mexican, Italian and deli areas but the section that needs some work is the dessert section because you have to squeeze in between the dessert island and the cake shelf if there are other guests grabbing dessert and it just feels so cramped. \n\nAnother thing that bothers me is the section between the seafood and Mexican food because you'd have to walk across a small part of the dining hall to get to the other section and I think it would be better if they extended the tile connecting both stations rather then walking on the carpet. \n\nLike the other Yelpers said it feels like eating in a cafeteria and I do agree with them.

I have always wanted to eat at this hotel but I was not so sure about their restaurants. However, coming to Cravings made me have no regrets about buffets. \n\nFirst off, the interior is extremely nice. You are greeted to a wide space where there are two cashiers, one in front of the other, and there you will pay for your meal. The hosts are nice as well. I like how there are more than one hostess in this buffet because they are able to organize where to sit the customers, so it won\'t be such a big mess when there are many parties waiting for their seat. \n\nThe inside of the buffet is wonderful. It has a clean, functional, modern look to it and there are signs of what stations they provide. They provide typical sections such as Chinese, Italian, BBQ, and more. What was really interesting was their salad bar. Someone actually prepares the salad for you the way that you want! I thought that was nice. \n\nThe food is pretty okay. The crab legs are a bit salty but it\'s enough to satisfy those seafood lovers. Their jumbo shrimp really gets the brownie points here. They\'re big and they\'re not pilled up, like how they do it at other buffets. They put out enough shrimp for you to get enough on your plate. Plus, they offer other ways of eating shrimp. Their food was not dry and I appreciate that a lot. They make sure their foods are fresh and ready to serve. Even their pizza wasn\'t as hard as cardboard. It tasted fresh! Their prime rib was excellent and even their Chinese food was easy to manage for someone, like me, who can\'t stand Chinese food as much as they want to. They have a variety of options in each section so you\'ll  be able to get enough food for the price you pay. One thing that bothered me as a Korean was that they put Kimchi in the Chinese section. Kimchi is an authentic Korean side dish, not Chinese. I hope they make this correction fast. \n\nTheir plating is absolutely AMAZING! I love how they care about every aspect of the buffet from the interior of the restaurant to the plates and silverware they use. The pictures the other Yelpers provide definitely give you a great idea of how the restaurant is and what to expect. It shows that they value their customers and want everyone to feel that they are eating the best of the best in Las Vegas. \n\nOverall, I am a huge fan of this place. I have been to many buffets in Las Vegas and I cannot be any happier about choosing this buffet. You can come here before seeing a show or with your friends before a long night of partying with your friends at the hottest club in Vegas. If there are children part of the party,  come by for their desserts. There are a wide variety of choices from ice cream to cookies and cakes everyone can enjoy. For the parents, a nice sip of coffee will do just right after a delicious meal from many cultures. This is one good stop to go to and there won\'t be any regrets choosing a buffet instead of a restaurant. There is a reason why this buffet is called "Cravings": everything that you are craving for, you can get it here! :) \n\nBon appetite!', 'business_id': '8zL3V6rmFKBess3bxPLAoQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2012-12-24', 'type': 'review'}

Boy was I wrong...I was very disappointed as soon as I walked around and realized that there isn't anything special.

There were no crab legs and they had very little shrimp entrees to choose from. On top of that, everything here tasted just okay. Definitely not worth the price!\n\nThe only thing that was good about this buffet was the fact that they had so many different types of food to chose from.

I think some of my favorites were the mussels, ravioli, and the shrimp cocktails. My siblings and I also gorged on the nachos we loaded up with toppings. I would pass on the sushi because the rice was just so hard. If you're like us, you will just eat the fish and hide the rice under some other dish. If you're super Korean like my parents, you will like the fact that they serve kimchi. They had a pretty huge selection on desserts. The cupcakes are GROSS so please pass on those. Actually pretty much all the desserts were kind of unappetizing. Some of the cookies were okay but that's about it.

A LOT, but nothing from Mexico or Italy. \n\nWe got lots of stuff from the Asian section. \n- Edimames: already shelled, nice.\n- Japanese potato salad: nice.\n- A little sushi: only the octopus was good, the others were grocery store style.\n- Chinese buns: spouse liked them, pork & seafood, I only had the seafood, too doughy.\n- Potstickers: good. Spouse liked these quite a bit, actually.\n\nThen on to the seafood section.\n- Large shrimps: good. But the cocktail sauce was obviously from a jar. Took a little drawn butter instead back to the table, that was nice.\n- Bay shrimps, various preparations: avoid.\n- Ceviches: avoid.\n- Crab legs: the thinnest, chewiest, worst crab legs I\'ve ever encountered. I took only one, ate half, yuck. Never again.\n\nSpouse had lots more. What was it? Oh, biscuits/gravy (I tasted, so-so), some kind of potatoes gratin, what else? He was OK with all of it. Me, I had read the ups and downs of the prime rib. "Only get it rare", some have posted here. Well, spouse came back with a small non-rare, and it was so-so, he only ate half. I went, got bloody rare, huge piece, ate nearly the entire thing, I was very happy! Not the greatest prime rib, of course, but still, it was really good, at the end of the savory foods.\n\nIf there were ever a next time, I think I\'d stick to the Asian section, try some of those egg-drop soups, etc.\n\nDesserts? Sad. "Mirage bread pudding" was a mishmash of runny bottom of pan with hard-ass top of portion. Not good. The creme brulee was so-so. The only recommended ones we\'d say would be the raspberry bar (very fruity, probably jam, but who cares!) and the marshmallows covered in dark chocolate (which were light after a huge meal like ours). \n\nTo sum up. I would never go there and pay full price.

This buffet restaurant had bad service and bad food we did not expect to be at 4 star hotel. We came there the day before Thank Giving 2012 for Dinner with a group of 4 adults and 3 kids. Price is expensive $30/adult and $23/kid but it failed our expectation for the price we paid. The king crab legs were supper dooper salty, I meant very very very salty (they intended so you can't eat)! These crab legs also had the smell of spoil food and the crab meat ( you could see since they precut in half) turned yellowish/ brownish color. I think that why they dumped in more salt in to reserve the food or to masked the taste of bad food. Their meat dumplings (dim sum) filled with undercooked meat clearly visible supper red meat inside and smell bad. I urged to throw up after a bite of it right at the table. After that, I asked to talk to a manager, manager never came and later was told by our Waiter he will tell the manager himself and will talk to the guy who in charge of the dumplings and suggest I get different food. I couldn't pick anything else except for the salad bar and bread that look fresh. Their boiled shrimps on ice smell bad and taste like you eating bad white rice. Their foods and soups are all salty. If you want foods like these you don't have to go to a restaurant and pay that much. You can play with a 5 year old to mix all the ingredients in and it might turn out better. It also take us so long to get our drinks and when we ask for refills, the waiter busy and when we reminded the other waiters who was walking around and another one cleaning up our next table, they said I had to ask the waiter who serve our table. Then our waiter came back after 10-15 minutes. We needed the drink to saturated their salty food but need to wait that long ? I will never ever come back there again. If there is a zero star I would give them a zero. Please don't waste your time and money here.", 'business_id': '8zL3V6rmFKBess3bxPLAoQ', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2013-04-16', 'type': 'review'}

Gelato red velvet cake cookies  cupcakes that are just so cute and great tasting. Great salad bar. For about 20 dollars plus tax you can enjoy all this .

We've tried The Village at Paris, Spice Market buffet at Planet Hollywood, The Buffet at Treasure Island, and Flavor at Harrah's.  We weren't too impressed at our last visit to Cravings.  It was much better this time.  The restaurant walls are all glass so you can see out and people can see in.  We got a nice table for four in the middle of everything and a nice waitress who brought drinks and cleared the table when she came by.  The first section has someone who is usually making egg dishes.  In our case, omelets.  They will sautee the onions, bacon, and mushrooms and then add it to the omelete.  They have one main guy and he has helpers.  They have a tip jar too.  \nNext section along the wall was some cooked items, eggs benedict, either waffles or pancakes.  Whatever was there, a customer in front of me wanted what wasn't there. \nThen there is the meat person.  He had turkey  and prime rib.  The prime rib was well done.  There was au jus and turkey gravy in that section too.  Next was the roast chicken section, fondue and bread/crackers. The fondue didn't harden by the time I got to the table and it tasted okay. \nThe next wall had mexican food, but it wasn't well organized or I was going the wrong way.  I walked by cheese, then the meat, chips, taco, and tortillas, salsa, and enchiladas.  Before I forget, the enchiladas were good.  \nThere was some ceviche and tiny shrimps in little glasses, shrimp on ice in the cubby holes in the walls.  I don't have a good way to describe it.  I tried the clam chowder and it needed pepper.  The texture was clam chowder and it looked good, but it wasn't really tasty.  There was a Japanese counter.  I thought the crunchy spicy tuna roll and unagi roll was too cold.  \nThe Chinese counter had shrimp flavored chips, yummy, but greasy. It was either a gyoza or potsticker and it was on it's own little plate with a little sauce.  It's the presentation. \nEverything was clean.  Hot and sour soup was the right texture but not enough flavor.  Chinese noodles and rice, sauteed veg and sweet and sour chicken or pork.  I didn't try it. \nThe last section was dessert.  They had mini cupcakes.  I liked the chocolate and regular creme brulee cups.  There were also tiramisu in a little cup and I think it was a berry flavor panna cotta.  And the very end had a gelato section.  The tiramisu gelato was good.\nThere is a lot of food dishes that I'm not mentioning.  The Village was our favorite at one time, same with the others, but we go back and then we are disappointed.  The eggs benedict wasn't very good, the hollandaise sauce didn't stand out.  The presentation is usually much better at Cravings.  There's so much food that we kind of try everything and then we are full.\n  \nSummary - Cravings was better than our last trip.  Kids were happy, waitress was nice, no dishes were really bad, everything was clean and presentation was nice.  We'll be back and we'll also go back to the other buffets too.", 'business_id': '8zL3V6rmFKBess3bxPLAoQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2013-06-22', 'type': 'review'}

While both are spectacular choices, I think one of the biggest drawbacks of both of them is that the wait is pretty long. It can be anywhere between 40 minutes to 1.5 hours.\n\nYou'll never had such a wait at cravings. Since we didn't want to wait that long and we needed some sort of sustenance to soak up all the excess alcohol we drank the night before, we decided to be efficient and go to the buffet downstairs from the Mirage, where we stayed this weekend.\n\nWe arrived there around 10:30a and zipped pass the cashier since there was no line! For $28, which is $10 less than Wynn and Wicked,  we got not only entry into the buffet, but unlimited mimosas.\n\nWhile I wouldn't say the choice selection here is that big of a range, they did have all I wanted from a buffet. Smoked salmon, check. King crab legs, check. Prime rib, check! But one of the greatest things I discovered at this buffet was that they had Bouillabaisse!! The soup was prepared pretty well, while it doesn't compare to what I had in Marseilles in 2010, it sure hit the spot in my stomach and evoked many great memories from my time in Europe!\n\nOverall, Cravings is an underrated buffet you should consider if you don't want to wait at Wynn or Wicked. 4 stars and definitely returning again!", 'business_id': '8zL3V6rmFKBess3bxPLAoQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2013-07-22', 'type': 'review'}

I make no claims to the dinner service.\nSecond, my evaluation is done from a perspective that I am evaluating a buffet.  I don't compare and rate a buffet with fine dining restaurants.\n\nThe Mirage breakfast buffet was acceptable, but it would not have been at full price (we were comp'd both times).  The food is typical buffet quality.  Not outstanding and not original.  The options during the breakfast are surprisingly limited.  This is even true at the omelet station where there are a limited number of ingredients.  I walked away full, but felt those who paid full price would have been disappointed.\n\nThe brunch has many more options and comes with alcohol, however the price is significantly higher (again, I didn't pay it).\n\nI'd have a hard time justifying the $20 price for the regular breakfast.  If one has transportation, Sunset Station would offer a better buffet at less than half the price.\n\nIf you're on the strip and going to pay full price, I think you'd do much better at Cosmo (Wicked Spoon) or Aria.\n\nThe one place I felt the buffet might have had a slight edge was in the desserts.  Some very good options there.\n\nIf you're comp'd, it's a fine.  If you've got a two-for-one and you're already there, it's okay.

The food quality is good. 95% of everything I tried, from the pizza to dimsum, were all delicious. \n\nOne thing I did not like was their Spicy Tomato Soup. Holy ishhhh, one slurp tasted like a whole bottle of hot sauce. I understand it had to be spicy but it didn't have to be dsfhdkjhsdfkgjfskjldSPICYYYYYY! Besides that one particular item, I liked their food.\n\nDon't forget the extensive dessert selection, tucked in the corner. I think I ate too much of the Creme Brulee because it was SO yummy! Really cute arrangement for the sweets but ice cream flavors could definitely improve. They need more, I think.\n\nOverall, it's a good place for a buffet. But don't expect it to be Bacchanal or Wicked Spoon-esque. Those are the big league of buffets.

Perhaps the single most influential reason for us coming back so many times was Marivell the cashier who we purchased our buffet from. She was so friendly and kind. We had a number of different servers and they all had their unique characteristics but Marivell treated us with respect and kindness. One of the nicest people we interacted with during our stay in Vegas. \n\nThe four stars is because the cost was high. I know it is not the most expensive buffet but it was pricey to say the least. The first breakfast we paid full price which was $41 (ish) before the gratuity. Dinner was almost double that. After that we were able to use myVegas points to purchase 2-for-1 coupons which made the price more reasonable. \n\nThe quality and variety of food was great. So many options and many great tastes. Dinner has even more than breakfast but both have plenty for just about any appetite or desire. Free beer and wine are limitless and included in the price of the buffet. Though I do agree that it is 5 oclock somewhere, I was not up for beer at breakfast though a few others guests were. I did at dinner and also purchased a mixed drink which was made very well. The bartender was nice and much nicer to me since I tipped him rather than demand free beer and grab and dash with it only to return a minute later demanding more still with no tip. That is a gripe on customers not the buffet so I'll leave it at that. \n\nGood food and pretty spot-on service from the servers and excellent customer service from Marivell.", 'business_id': '8zL3V6rmFKBess3bxPLAoQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2014-03-01', 'type': 'review'}

By whom? A bunch of drunks?), I was delighted to have just the opposite experience tonight at Cravings! Seriously...from start to finish, it was like night and day!\n\nTo begin with, the first thing we noticed as we walked in (other than the fact that we WERE able to walk right in) was that everything smelled and looked incredibly appetizing (a real contrast to Bacchanal\'s rancid-smelling steam tables!). A quick turn around the stations (which are organized in a neat oval, so you can easily see what\'s available) showed that there was plenty available for us to eat (we\'re vegetarians, and my husband has a seafood allergy, so we\'re a little pickier than a lot of buffet diners).\n\nMost importantly, everything was beautifully fresh, clearly labeled, and nicely presented. Again, after our experience of wilted greens, dried-out rice and bread, and tasteless pizza the night before, the contrast was striking. This looked and smelled, from the get-go, like stuff we really WANTED to eat rather than something we were settling for.\n\nAnother important point: When I asked the people at the stations what was in this dish or that, they KNEW, without having to scratch their heads, mutter "I dunno" and go find someone else (yes, we had that experience at Bacchanal as well).\n\nEverything I had was delicious (and it was quite a mixture...ranging from vegetable spring rolls from the Chinese station to beautiful Arab-style hummus, tabouli, and FRESH, SOFT pita from the Mediterranean station). I was especially impressed by the range of cheeses in the deli section. Sage Derby! Guinness-laced Irish Cheddar! Yum!\n\nJust because, I sampled the pizza as well, and again, the contrast was marked. This pizza was fresh and tasty, and I would have had more if I hadn\'t had so many other things I wanted to sample.\n\nI think my favorite part was the salad station. A nice selection of lovely, fresh greens, and all kinds of toppings and mix-ins...and the entertaining salad chef puts it together for you and tosses it to order for you!\n\nI don\'t eat it myself, but you seafood fans will be happy to know that yes...they have unlimited king crab legs and drawn butter. Every buffet in Vegas has unlimited crab legs. It\'s a thing.\n\nOh, and did I mention the free beer and wine? That\'s right...you get all the beer or wine you want as part of the price of your meal (soft drinks as well, of course).\n\nAnd the price? Well, this is Vegas, so it\'s not not cheap, but it\'s not bad at $26.99/person (especially when you factor in the drinks). We had a better food selection, MUCH better quality food, a knowledgeable and friendly staff, a better \nselection of drinks, and just an all-around better experience, at a fraction of the cost. From here on out, Cravings will be our FIRST pick when it comes to buffet dining in Las Vegas!', 'business_id': '8zL3V6rmFKBess3bxPLAoQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2014-03-03', 'type': 'review'}

At least if you eat (and drink) like I do, it is.  \n"Buffet, meet Jessica."  *buffet runs away screaming*\n\nI can safely say that this is my favorite buffet for champagne brunch in Vegas.  I have now been here three out of the last three times I have been in Vegas and plan to make it four out of four whenever my next Vegas adventure may be.  The mimosas are truly bottomless, and the service is friendly and attentive.   I love that they\'re open on Saturdays as well as Sundays and especially that brunch runs until 3pm (because let\'s face it an "early start" is anytime before noon in Vegas time).\n\nThe crab legs never run out.  They have a beautifully fresh and bountiful seafood section that overflows with an abundance of various shellfish, as well as a tasty selection of hot seafood dishes.   This is what stole my heart and kept me coming back.   \n\nI love that they have a wide variety of international cuisines to choose from, with plenty of emphasis on the Asian styles (my favorites!) including sushi, dim sum, assorted pho and ramen soups, Thai, Chinese, and the like.   I tried my first (good) Ramen here, and that is the bowl that first sold me on it as a legitimate cuisine.   There is also a selection of Mexican, Italian, Indian, Mediterranean, and so many other types of food I can\'t even think of them all.   They also have a nice array more common american-ish foods here including a rotisserie (serving prime rib and other meats), fried everything, any side dish I can ever remember having on my parents\' dinner table, a salad bar, and all breakfast-y  foods imaginable including an omelette bar and waffle station. \n\nAnd then there\'s dessert.  (If you have any hidden nook in your tummy that is not stuffed full at this point.)   A decadent assortment of chocolate and baked everything.  Cue sugar coma. \n\nKeep in mind that it *is* a buffet so you are not going to get sushi that is equal to the best sushi restaurant you\'ve ever eaten at or prime rib as good as the Michelin joint up the street ...  but considering how (comparatively) little you are paying the selection, sheer volume, and the fun experience make up for that in my opinion.  I don\'t consider this my \'fine dining\' experience of the weekend... it\'s more of the \'lets see how many mimosas and crab legs we can shove in our faces in 2 hours then walk around Vegas all drunk-and-full-like for the next few hours\' way to start your day/weekend.

I thought that was pretty good for a Saturday night. It took less than 10min for us to be seated at our table. \n- I suggest starting off with the shrimp cocktails and crab legs. The line can get pretty long, but if you time it right, your meal will start off great. The shrimp cocktails are pretty big too compared to Feast Buffet. Crab legs not as meaty as Bellagio. \n- Their wanton soup was pretty good but not as good as the Rio Carnival World. \n- Prime rib was average like any other buffet like Feast, but there is no grill if you wanted it Med-well or well done like Sam's Town. \n- I did enjoy their seafood stew. It had a lot of scallop and clams in it, less small shell bits, few corn. \n- Avoid the steamed cod. It was a bit tough and flavorless. \n- Do mack on the BBQ spare ribs! It was tender and so saucy! I loved it. It was especially tasty with the creamed corn. I love corn! :D nom nom\n- The sushi was filler for me so after a few, I didn't bother getting more\n- Their dim sum was pretty good. I suggest that you should at least grab one of each. Don't get the Ramen though. The noodle tasted like Maruchan. meehhhhh! But I did really like the egg! \n- I don't care much for the desserts, but my girlfriend thought it was worth trying. Don't expect to find macarons here though!\n- Although I did not drink the wine, I did get the beer. The choice was between a Bud Light or a pale ale.

Redeeming my reward at the buffet was easy, just let the cashier know you're using one and they take care of the rest. \n\nThe buffet is located at the back of the casino floor, close to Stack. The dining room is huge, and it was packed at 9am. Scored a booth on the side at the end, so we had lots of room. The food choices are expansive! Almost every station was open for breakfast, even the pizza area! They were making omelets and breakfast pizzas, yum! They offered every type of breakfast pastry you could ever want, along with every type of breakfast meat you could ever want. Tons of choices, but if you're vegetarian you might have a harder time filling up. I don't eat pork, so my meat options were pretty slim, but I had more than enough on my plate to make up for it. \n\nThey have a bar set up in the back - it was open for breakfast but I don't know if the drinks are extra. The buffet areas are a little spread out, but you need to do a little extra walking after eating here lol. I have recommended this buffet to everyone I know visiting Vegas in the near future, it was great! And getting a big discount doesn't hurt, so sign up for the MyVegas game if you want 2 for 1!", 'business_id': '8zL3V6rmFKBess3bxPLAoQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2014-05-07', 'type': 'review'}

I tried this buffet after being blown away by the buffet at Bellagio, and was mildly disappointed after visiting this one. \n\nThe staff was friendly and attentive but we had to get our own drinks. I liked that Bellagio brought them to the table. Also, the free wine that comes with the meal is awful. The Chardonnay was bitter and super dry instead of smooth and buttery, which is what I like, personally, in a Chardonnay. I opted for Sprite Zero after a sip or two. \n\nThe assortment of food was kind of... Off. Nothing really matches. The barbecue section had not one item with BBQ sauce and no grilled items; it consisted of hot wings, cabbage and nothing else I would see at a BBQ joint down south.  The Latin section had quail, tortilla chips and potatoes.  As I walked around it was hard to decide what to build my meal out of because it was all so random. \n\nThe good: prime rib was juicy, shumai was scrumptious. \nThe bad: The broccoli stir fry in the Chinese section was bitter and greasy. Wine selection was awful. \nThe ugly: The creme br\xfbl\xe9e was liquidy and the sugar on top was not at all crispy-- it had the consistency of flan. The pizza dough wasn't cut all the way through and it was pretty gross watching people pull it apart with their hands, leaving pieces they touched behind. \n\nMy advice- go to Bellagio instead.

My guesses are depending on your palate of what you like to eat rather than quality etc. Next is depending on the day you go they may serve better things, lets say the weekend. I came here on a weekday for dinner and i didn't each much because nothing seems good to me. I go to Vegas quite often and pretty much tried 90% of all the buffets in Vegas. Not embarrassed to say, people don't call me a buffet queen for nothing you know. So I am comparing them to each other. Here is a few things in a nutshell:\n\nThe Chimichurri sauce was extremely spicy without warning. Although I guess its my fault for not catching all the chilli flakes that were in there but it would have been a nice courtesy to put that on a menu card. (minus-1/2 star) The biscuits were hard and cold as if it may injure someone if I threw it across the room. I even questioned if it was suppose to be for display only and I grabbed it by accident since they were cold. (minus-1/2 star) The presentations of the food were ok not great. For a place that big, I would have thought there were a lot of varieties but there wasn't. The seafood are not as fresh as many other buffets I have had in Vegas. The desserts were good but again not great. They had macarons which I love but they were thrown all over the place on a dish. Some fell off to the table and some were pretty broken up pieces that shouldn't be placed there anymore. (minus 1-star)\n\nIn a way, I kind of like how we can grab our own drinks at the beverage bar yet I also see it as part of a service. So you can be the judge of what floats your boat. The service was great though as the server looked at my receipt while I was getting my food first and when I returned he greeted us my our last names. Very professional. They were friendly and grabs my old plates away pretty quickly. There were ice cream but the person that scoops it was not there. I stood there for almost 5 minutes before she came out from the kitchen. First time this ever happened in Vegas. Don't they have coverage should she need to walk away for a minute?\n\nCost: for about $30/dinner, I have had much better and more variety of selections.  I understand maybe its because the beer and wine are unlimited but think the customer should have a choice to opt out and not pay for that portion if they don't want to drink any alcohol there. (minus-1 star)\n\nSo overall, this place is descent but seriously for the price you pay, I wouldn't eat there again as I had much better elsewhere for a fraction of the cost.

We also felt it lacked in comparison to others we have been to in the past.  \n\nThis is not to say that we did not like it; however, if we would not have been redeeming the Buy 1, Get 1, we might have even given it a 2.  \n\nIn the world of Vegas Buffets, they are also changing things up.

We received not only the option of mimosas, but a wide selection  of beer and wine with our meal at no extra charge. We stuck with mimosas as that just seemed the perfect thing after a evening out on the town the previous night. The pastries were good, better than you get at any free breakfast with hotel stay (comparing it to other hotels we stay at when traveling, not in Vegas). The croissants were cold but were flaky and not overly buttery. Almost the best I've had in the U.S. Bacon was warm and crispy, not overly greasy like typical buffet bacon. We sampled the Asian, Mexican, and Salad areas of the buffet. We liked everything we tried. I did wish the Mexican station had tamales, but that's only because I was craving them. I'm a salad whore and felt their more upscale way of making/serving their salad (they make it for you but you get to pick what goes in it) was a bit snobbish. It's served in these little bowls. Probably good for the average person. When I want a salad, I want a huge plate of salad! Delicious house dressing, btw.

Huge prawns and crab legs all peeled and ready to eat, juicy tender roast beef just the way you like it, a wide dessert range to give you a big toothache, just to name a few.. The food really do hit the spot, get your cravings sorted! ;) oh, drinks are included in the price including all the beer and wine you want!! nb: toilets are outside the restaurants, literally next door.", 'business_id': '8zL3V6rmFKBess3bxPLAoQ', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2014-09-10', 'type': 'review'}

The Cravings Buffet at Mirage is certainly not a fancy buffet, but it works in a pinch.  It works even better if you can get it for free, or at a discounted price.

Now, I\'m thankful that the meal was free, because had I paid full price I don\'t really feel like it would have been worth it, at least this time.\n\nThis buffet certainly has a lot of options, it\'s just that a lot of the food is mediocre.  We came here for lunch, and they still had their homemade omelette station going, so I nabbed one of those.  I enjoyed the omelette, but was having a tough time finding other options that interested me.  They do have a self-service drink station now, which consists of one of those fancy new coke machines.  You can also get coffee, milk, juice, etc.  Or, you can get free beer or wine, but the selection is limited.\n\nI feel bad for the servers at this buffet, because they are essentially glorified buss boys.  All they did was clear a few of the plates off the table once, and then we never really saw them again.  It\'s kind of a pain to walk all the way to the other side of the room every time you need a refill.  No service=No tip.\n\nI guess the thing that bugged me the most was their dessert station.  It was noon and they still had several of their breakfast items out there.  Sorry, but I\'m not interested in donuts that have been sitting there for a few hours for dessert.  Many of the cupcakes offered were dry, and the creme brulee was subpar at best.  Also, they took away the homemade gelato and replaced it with ice cream machines.  Seriously??

They also have a to-go option: $16 for a box.\n\nBF wanted something fairly quick and everything else in the casino would\'ve had a long wait. Came on a Sunday (3/1/2015) around 11AM and there was no line (that should\'ve been our first indicator about this place).\n\nNote: Drinks are SELF-SERVE!! So if you\'re going to pre-tip at the cashier, I wouldn\'t tip very much since they hardly stop by to clear the tables or re-fill any alcoholic beverages you may have ordered.\n\nBeer, Wine & Mimosas included during brunch.\n\nWaffles were soggy but the french toast was pretty good (lots of cinnamon). There\'s a chef station that does custom omelettes but the line was too long. There\'s also different pizzas next to the chef station if you want pizza for brunch.\n\nTried the potsticker and seafood bun. The bun was really gross and mushy, but the filling was ok. Potsticker tasted like the frozen kind. Fried wonton was mostly oil and almost no filling.\n\nThe chilled shrimp and king crab legs were decent. The cioppino was probably the tastiest thing there but the bread that supposed to go with it was very stale (avoid it). Stayed away from all the sushi and sashimi since they all looked old and rubbery.\n\nThere\'s a carving station where the carver kind of creeped me out. He kept staring at me while he was cutting the prime rib that I ordered -_-|| The meat was fairly tender and juicy, but not much flavor.\n\nThe desserts didn\'t look too appealing: very dry-looking. The creme brulee tasted boxed and the panna cotta tasted like a pudding cup. I found it very weird that the "sorbet" is dispensed out of a soft serve machine. The toppings are around the corner of the machine.\n\nService is pretty much non-existent which sucks since my BF gave a good pre-tip. Lucky we were seated at a 4 person table even though we were only a pair because we just left our dirty dishes on the empty table (which got piled high). If you want a refill on your mimosas or beer, just get up and go to the counter yourself (otherwise you\'ll never get another drink).\n\nIf you have a voucher or a discount to come here, try it out.. But do NOT come here if you have to pay full price. Definitely not worth it at all. Our friends had a free voucher and they thought the buffet was really bad.

He did not speak English and her questions were received with pointing and grunts. She returned the plate started again and pointed to the gravy she preferred. The second gentleman picked ham no topping and finally it was my turn. Prime rib rare please!

I'm not going to keep the 3 people behind me waiting any longer so I moved to the mashed potatoes and corn, which were the height of my meal at Cravings. So good I grabbed seconds.

I was suprised that u have to go get soft drink for myself. \nIt is not worth it for $29.99 even with MyVEGAS redeem gold coins. \nI will stop writing now because I have to go get drink for my wife. I am the server myself. Ahhahaha\nOh I forgot 1 thing, ask to come inside to take a look before you pay.\nI recommend please tip good the server because the plates are heavy. You have to go get drink it is not their fault. They set the rules that we have to server drink for ourself.', 'business_id': '8zL3V6rmFKBess3bxPLAoQ', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2015-08-03', 'type': 'review'}

I was very unimpressed.\n\nSo let\'s begin -\n\nThe pros:\n\nServe-yourself drink station. They have that new-fangled Coke machine (actually, it\'s been out for a few years) that allows you to customize your own drinks (as long as the syrup is part of the Coke family). Milk, coffee, cappuccino (don\'t get too excited - we\'re talking about the ones you find at the gas station mart).\n\nComplimentary wine and beer. I cannot comment on this, since I did not partake.\n\nA wide range of stations (Asian, Latin, Italian, et al).\n\nThe cons:\n\nRemember that cappuccino machine? I tried a Vanilla Cappuccino, and it tasted watery. Evidently someone forget to check the powder level for the mix.\n\nThe food is seriously sub-par. Prime rib was cooked medium rare, but was inexplicably tough. The Asian foods were scary ick - sushi was sub-sub par (according to my wife), the shu mai (a type of dim sum) was mushy and tasteless. My wife said that the mashed potatoes had the consistency of paste - too bad we didn\'t have reams of newspaper, I could have started a paper-mache project.\n\nThe dessert section deserves its own paragraph of ill repute. There is a machine that says "gelato" - unfortunately, it spews something more like ice milk ("something that was almost, but not quite, entirely unlike gelato"). There was Boston Creme Pie, which somehow lacked the Creme portion (I guess you cannot call it "Boston Pie"?), a concoction called "Equator" that left a weird brown smear that resembled the slime left by an apoplectic snail after binging on bad cabbage. And worse - no cheesecake. I mean seriously - have you ever been to a casino buffet that did not offer cheesecake? That\'s like going to a diner south of the Mason-Dixon Line that didn\'t offer grits....\n\nThe one saving grace is that our dinner had been comped. But even then we somehow felt short-changed.\n\nPro Tips:\n\nGo for dishes that cannot be ruined. Pasta, white rice - this trip probably wouldn\'t be the best time to start that gluten-free diet.\n\nJoin M-Life (the loyalty program at the casino). I know I sound like a shill, but if you\'re going to play the tables and machines, you might as well earn points.\n\nPlay MyVegas. We earned the comps via the game. It\'s free - and you can get free stuff. You too can be Mike and Trent (let\'s see who caught that reference).', 'business_id': '8zL3V6rmFKBess3bxPLAoQ', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2015-08-05', 'type': 'review'}

The line is very short at 7:00pm.  I used to come here before this place got remodeled so I expect it must be better after remodeling.  The first thing I know is I have to get my own drink which is the other end where I sit.  No server for drink like before.  Only bus boys to take your dishes.  Be prepared if you have small children and you have to serve them drinks.  The Asian food section is more than half empty.   For over one hour I kept checking on BBQ Pork Bun and Seafood bun but they did not get refill.  The chef was very busy with his wok.  Every section has only one chef so the refill is very slow.  The wonton and noodle is ready to serve in the pot.  It used to be prepared by the chef for your order so it's very fresh.  The American food section offers like five items but no fries.  BBQ ribs is hard and dry.  The corn is very good.  I got to say the only good item I like is corn that night.  Buffalo wing is ok but very spicy.  The Carving section offers very well done prime rib so I came back later for a medium slice.  The well done part is falling apart so I hear the other guests asked if it was pull pork.  Prime rib has no taste.  I cannot taste the spices from the rub at all.  Seafood section offers crab legs and cocktail shrimp.  Salad bar and cold item have a good selection.  They also have the Latino food section.  Beside pizzas there is Chef's Kitchen for Italian food but I found no menu for you to order which dishes you want.  I saw the pasta dish that the chef was cooking.  It came in big portion that I'm sure I cannot finish that.  There are vanilla yogurt, chocolate yogurt, raspberry sorbet and peach sorbet at Gelato section.   The dessert section needs to get updated on the menu and the d\xe9cor.  The watermelon is cut with dice shape so they get smashed up with the serving spoon.  The watermelon should be sliced and use tongs to serve.  It should not be an issue to get drinks if you do not have children or sitting too far from the soda station.  For the same price, you can go to other buffet like Aria that offers more variety of foods, dessert and gelato and has server.  I noticed that not a lot people left tips for the bus boy who cleared the heavy dishes but I tipped him anyway for his hard work.  For the variety and quality of food and speed of refilling food, I would not recommend to others.", 'business_id': '8zL3V6rmFKBess3bxPLAoQ', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2015-08-05', 'type': 'review'}

After reading the Yelp reviews with a "Yelp sort", we knew we could not go wrong at Cravings.  Yelp sort is interesting.  You always seem to find higher rated reviews on top, which is the first thing a viewer sees, so when a reviewer writes that Cravings Buffet is one of the best on the strip, you can\'t help but put faith in the review.  Wrong thing to do.  Sort by the most recent reviews and read everything for the past few weeks. \n\nWe arrived at Cravings Buffet and were greeted with smiles from the cashier to the hostess to employees on the floor.  Eleven food stations were filled with fresh, perfectly seasoned and delicious foods to tantalize even the most sophisticated palate. From Asian to Italian, each station duplicated authentic ethnic cooking.\n\nThe second paragraph written above is more of a fantasy and not reality.  Our experience was the exact opposite.  I have given Cravings a one-star because that is the lowest Yelp allows.  Had there been an opportunity to give a negative 1,2,3, etc, it would have been rated the absolute lowest and for good reason.  \n\nThe old saying, "you get what you pay for" does not apply when dining at Cravings Buffet in the beautiful Mirage Hotel, Las Vegas.  The buffet is one of the more expensive on the Las Vegas Strip, so anyone reading the Yelp reviews and other expect at least good food, if not exceptional.\n\nWe arrived at Cravings just a few minutes after 3 PM when the dinner menu began.  Prices increase considerably if you arrive at 3 PM instead of 2:58 PM or 2:59 PM.  That is the difference between their Friday brunch and Friday dinner.\n\nFirst impressions are lasting ones and the cashier was not too friendly, though not nearly as rude as the seating hostess. Okay, so you only deal with those two for a few minutes before moving onto more disappointment. My husband went straight to the seafood station, while I headed for the Asian cuisine.  His crab legs and mussels were terribly overcooked and had no seasoning.  He drank one of their cheap beers from the bar before trying the crappy red and white wines.  Veronica was working the floor when she came to the table to ask if everything was okay.  My husband told her the crab legs were rubbery and she said that is the way crab is prepared at Cravings.  I grabbed some rice, chow mein, Asian dumplings, sushi, and a few other things to sample.  Of course nothing tasted good.  Everything was mushy and bland.  Sad, sad, sad.\n\nA few tips to Cravings Buffet management at the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas:\n\n1) Train or retrain your staff in customer service.  When employees are rude to customers, they will likely not return.\n\n2) You have a serious issue with food quality.  If your chefs are preparing the food according to the recipes, then change the recipes and purchase better quality ingredients.  If not, hire chefs with formal training.  That applies to your pastry chefs as well.  Your desserts are not worth eating.\n\n3) Train your serving staff, especially at the carving section.  First they should be knowledgeable about the products they are attempting to carve.  The carver should know the type of cut and the difference in temperatures.  When a customer requests medium rare, and the options are medium rare or well-done, it should be served as ordered.  If your  procedures are to have both temperatures available and they are not prepared properly, then your chefs should have caught the error and corrected.  Second, when someone asks to have meat cut thin, that does not mean 3/4" or more.  Their carving knives appeared to be capable of carving properly.\n\n4) Even when customers have a horrible experience, a good floor manager can make things better if they tried.  Again, that wasn\'t the case with us.  One of the other diners in our group requested the manager come to the table.  An older frumpy woman came, along with an assistant chef to hear some of the issues.  She explained to both that the food was grossly over-cooked and was terribly bland.  Salt and pepper is cheap, so why not use to help make your food taste better.  It was one of her birthday meals and she ended up spitting out \neverything she put into her mouth.  She told the manager it was some of the most disgusting food ever attempted to eat and was truly disappointed with the experience.  \n\nWhile three of the four at the table expressed to your personnel that the food was crappy, the only thing done was the manager refunded money for one person.  A good manager at a reputable restaurant would have refunded the entire amount, apologized for our unfortunate experience at Cravings Buffet, then ask us to return one day after they improve on their shortcomings and nothing less.  \n\nYou totally failed with food, customer service and value for price paid.  Shameful.', 'business_id': '8zL3V6rmFKBess3bxPLAoQ', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2015-08-08', 'type': 'review'}

Asian, American, Italian, fish, etc. The food seemed to be fresh, but they had obviously cut some corners on the food. The eggs Benedict was served on a roll, not the typical kind I'm used to. The shrimp was, well shrimpy. There was a long line to wait for the carving station. When I got the roast beef back to the table, it was rather fatty- a low quality of beef. \nThe desserts seemed to be leaning heavily towards the sugar free side, which blows my mind. If you're going to a Vegas buffet, I'm sure you're not terribly concerned about your waist line. \nThere was a lady that came by and picked up the used plates, but there was no other service available. You had to get your own drinks like some sort of shlub. \nI was pleased to see that there were about four different types of sushi, which seemed fresh. \nBut they were lacking many things that I have come to expect on a Vegas buffet.

You get entertainment as well!\nFood quality is better than average. I like the fact that you can make your own salad. So many buffets have someone mixing all your junk in stainless bowl and spilling it on your plate. I like to have the control please. Did you notice that those salad bars got scarce after the 9/11 attacks and all the fear that we would all be poisoned at a salad bar? Well, that happened right?..uh, no?\nBack to this buffet, the only thing missing is a really great desert section. Maybe real ice cream instead of the yogurt dispenser please? \nSo my advice is to hit this place for your first meal at 12: 30, and sit and eat and drink for about 2 hours, and you are good to go for the rest of the day.

There are so many stations filled with deliciousness that it is impossible to adequately describe.  My last few trips here have been brunch so I'll describe it in detail.  There is breakfast food, french toast, omelets, eggs benedict, and so forth.  Of course there is pizza, and Italian food.  There is a seafood station, with lots of peel and eat shrimp.  There is a Latin flavored station, an Asian themed station, of course the standard salad bar and dessert.  I didn't miss the best part, there is a sushi station that had Tako (octopus)!  It was amazing!\n\nNow the beverages:  In addition to the awesome Coke Freestyle Machines, there are milk, and juice machines.  There is also FREE beer and wine!  Yes this is included in the price of the buffet!  So much awesomeness!\n\nAlthough the beverages are self service, the wait staff was always busy cleaning up dishes and asking if there was anything they could do to make our dining experience better.  \n\nThe best part- being a local gets you 20% off! \n\nIf you're looking for a great place with a ton of options, a great local's discount, and a fun casino, you can do no better than to go to the Mirage.

As always, I win if I emerge with a full belly and happy about the things I put in it. The buffet wins if it makes me hate myself.\n\nRound One:\nI fill my first plate with a variety of sushi and pour myself a bowl of miso soup if for no other reason than the sushi station is adjacent to the bar (bottomless beer and wine for the win!). I\'m pleasantly surprised by the quality of the rolls and the miso goes down smoothly. I mean, is it even possible to screw up miso soup? In any case, I\'m very happy with my first plate and ready for further punishment. Round one goes to me.\n\nRound Two:\nA thought strikes me as I chug my third glass of wine. It\'s only 11am. I should get some breakfast food. I mosey on down to the omelette station and have the chef whip me up one with everything. I supplement it with way too much bacon and sit down to enjoy. Unfortunately I can\'t get more than halfway through it. The eggs are heavy and the toppings taste like they\'ve been sitting out for awhile. Well, they have, so I don\'t know what I was expecting. I shove aside the plate. Round two goes to the buffet.\n\nRound Three:\nI have to bounce back from my slip up last round. I make my way to the Asian station for Gyoza and War Won Ton Soup hoping to repeat the success of the sushi. Little do I know the soup has been lying in wait like a sleeper cell, ready to pounce on my tastebuds in a flavor explosion. It is far and away the best thing the buffet has to offer. I sneak another bowl as a victory lap. I win round three.\n\nRound Four:\nI\'m starting to feel the pressure of fullness creeping in, so I decide to take it easy this round. I slide to the salad bar for something light, grabbing a bowl and stuffing it with a generous scoop of every topping. After drizzling it with a glob of dressing, I shove this Frankenstein\'s monster of a salad into my face. Surprisingly it makes me super full. But it\'s lettuce, right? Oh well. I call this round a draw.\n\nRound Five:\nIn a surprising lack of judgment I decide to finish with something very stupid. I stroll over to the carving station. "Prime rib please." They slap a huge slab of dead cow on my plate and I scoop a mountain of mashed potatoes on the side with green beans. I don\'t know why I thought this would go well. I graze my way through the salty side of beef and do my best to put the potatoes away, but it\'s a losing battle at this point. Stomach at the edge of bursting, I shove aside the plate and raise my white flag. You win this one, buffet.\n\nThe verdict:\nWho even cares? It\'s $30 for all-you-can-eat (and drink of you only want beer or wine). The options aren\'t that great, but if you\'re like me and get blasted on wine first, you won\'t notice. 3 stars.', 'business_id': '8zL3V6rmFKBess3bxPLAoQ', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2015-12-13', 'type': 'review'}

We've had brunches and dinners. We've always found the food to be prepared well, plentiful both in selection as well as quantity, the servers to be friendly and helpful and the establishment to be clean.\n\nSome of our favorites are the prime rib, chilled (peeled and ready to eat) shrimp, crab legs, roasted chicken, omelette bar, unlimited wine and beer, and the desserts! YUM!\n\nThey also offer Ethnic choices such as Cajun, Asian, Italian and others.\n\nIf you're concerned about budget, I'd suggest buying the lunch buffet and going around 2:30pm. You'll get some of the dinner selections as well.", 'business_id': '8zL3V6rmFKBess3bxPLAoQ', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2015-12-20', 'type': 'review'}

Yea wine and beer were included and bottomless because the wine was likely made yesterday out of some synthetic package - terrible. \n\nThe stations themselves were mediocre at best; ITALIAN looked the best but didn't try any as it was all carbs and way to heaven to eat and the LATIN station was ok with chips/salsa and guacamole, bad canned beans, orange dye color rice, the CARVING station roast beef I have to say was very good, but the frozen crab legs and warm shrimp at the FISHMONGER looked terrible, American was empty when I went to it other than some corn bread muffins and the DESSERTS as wonderful as they looked I saw allot of them in tables with one or two small bites and the rest left. In fact most staff clearing tables were clearing plates still full of food \n\nI guess maybe two years ago the Christmas brunch was far better that the regular buffet.  \n\nShame - will not be recommending or returning here.", 'business_id': '8zL3V6rmFKBess3bxPLAoQ', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2015-12-24', 'type': 'review'}
