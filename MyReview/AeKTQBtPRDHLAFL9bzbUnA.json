They're opened 5PM to 3AM, great for the early dinner people and the late night munchies crowd. The restaurant is not huge, but I would say big enough for at least 50 patrons. All you can eat (AYCE) is $27.  \n\nThe menu seems to be the same as Sushi Mon, all except the extra items that were added to the blackboard and featured on the place mat. Some of the items were:\n\nGrilled Tofu Salad (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JyxHvtj-syke7m9rbza7mA?select=uTwz4uGpvFM6H8EttW-MVg). I've never had grilled tofu before, but it was interestingly good. The taste of the grilled tofu with a garlic sesame sauce was a good way to start the night. \n\nGrilled Pork Belly (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JyxHvtj-syke7m9rbza7mA?select=1pQReeZwUFgCpzY7qJ5rfA). Was similar to Monta's pork, but in a thick slice form.\n\nSpeaking of Monta, for whatever reason the Shoyu ramen is offered after 11pm. Not sure if the tonkutsu or miso are offered as well.\n\nExtra desserts not on the regular menu were tofu cheesecake, green tea creme brulee, and a green tea mousse cake, all were presented nicely and a nice touch for a AYCE sushi place. \n\nWhat I really enjoyed was the quality of the fish for a AYCE place. It was like they were not affected by the economy and continue to serve fish that wasn't chewy or smelled. Yay, but too bad they still use krab. \n\nThe service was excellent was well, the server checked up on my party quite often and we did not have to wait long receive our orders. One of my friend's ordered a shrimp nigiri and a few moments later the server came back asking if he wanted to try deep fried shrimp heads as well, with no cost of course since its AYCE. They actually want you to enjoy your meal haha.\n\nAnother plus is that I don't have to drive all the way to Maryland Pwky to get some quality AYCE anymore.

We arrived around 7pm on a Saturday night and there was an empty bar (totally meant to be for us). Shortly after (like 15 minutes later) the restaurant was full and there was a wait...luckily we got there at just the right time. This might be the new "it" place for sushi.\n\nThe sushi chef asked if we have been here before and we said no. He asked if we have been to the Sushi Mon on (Silverado and Maryland Pkwy), we said yes. He said the menu was the same except for the specials. There was a special menu that listed all the specials. \n\nWe started off with the specials.....toro (yes, fatty tuna) was on the specials menu!!!! This is totally not an all you can eat item! Some other items like the cajun salmon, big eye tuna, etc were also on there. We got our sushi pretty quickly and let\'s just say the quality was superb. One thing that I noticed quickly was that the nigri was not over stuffed with rice. It was a lil bit of rice with a lot of fish...definitely NOT your typical AYCE. We were able to try the grilled pork belly, a bunch of other nigiri and a few rolls. I don\'t think I had anything that I didn\'t like. \n\nDessert was good. They had this lychee sherbert that had chunks of lychee in it. I also tried the green tea creme brulee as well as the green tea cake. I think the lychee sherbert stole my heart though and that alone will make me come back.\n\nService was attentive for how busy they were, fish was fresh and everything was delicious. I will be back!

I don\'t think it\'s even close.  According to our very nice and helpful sushi chef, this is owned by the same folks who own Monta Ramen.  And Monta Ramen is delicious.  In fact, you can order the same ramen after 11 pm.  Either a la carte or as part of the all you can eat deal.  Not sure I\'d fill up on Ramen when getting AYCE but it\'s nice to have options.  \n\nPork belly - Wow.  Just absolutely deliciously fatty, crispy, and delicious.  The edges just have that beautiful crispiness you get from cooking it just right.  The rest just melts in your mouth.\nSpicy tuna on a "cracker" - pretty awesome.  It was like toasted rice topped with spicy tuna and their sauce.  Delicious.\nGrilled veggies - 2 small tomatoes slightly charred and perfectly tangy and delicious.  Nice mushroom, asparagus, and sweet potato slices.  I\'m on a low carb thing now and, had I not broken my diet by eating some sushi rolls, I probably would have eaten 4 of the veggie plates and 4 of the pork belly plates.\nSushi rolls - don\'t remember all I had.  Spicy tuna was good.  California was just ok but better than you\'ll get at other AYCE places.  Yellowtail was good.\nGreen Tea creme brulee - not too sweet and delicious.  Custard was nice and soft.  Sugar on top crispy and caramelized beautifully.\n\nAll in all - with the environment, great staff, and most importantly great food you will not regret coming here.

I noticed when sitting at the bar at any other AYCE sushi (specifically Hikari- you need to scream your order and get his attention). Here-he asked us what we wanted very often and I did not even have to try to get his attention. It was really amazing service. The green tea creme brulee stands out to me and the spicy tuna on crispy rice. I love how you get a small amount of rice with nigiri. Everything tasted fresh and came out very fast. \n\nMy biggest disappointments: sashimi salad-I am a big sashimi salad fan and their sashimi is truly disgusting. I think it has ponzu on it (gag). I could barely eat it. That being said the best sashimi salad I have ever had in Vegas is at I Love Sushi. Now that has homemade dressing on top. \n\nCold grilled tofu salad-that dressing is gross.

First order was of high quality--nice white, fatty slices with little blood line.  So good I wanted more, but the secound round was rather poor quality--fish was breaking apart like venetian blinds, little fat content and had a large amount of the dark red bloodline. MEH.  I must say their uni and amaebi were both very fresh though. The pork is tasty--simmered for a while till it\'s melt-in-your-mouth, similar texture to the pork you\'d find in a good ramen place.  The spicy tuna on crispy rice was good if you like yaki-onigiri, if you don\'t then don\'t get this since it is more rice than fish.  Special rolls we ordered were nothing special, dessert was nice with the green tea creme brulee & green tea ice cream.

I still like Sin City better, but there are alot of things to love about Sushi House Goyemon.  Hence the incredible Yelp! reviews for this place.  I would definitely visit this place again.    \n\nWe sat at the bar.  It was very busy on a Thursday night but there were two open seats, so no wait! Score!  At first, I was a little confused by the AYCE menu and no one explained it right away.  Eventually, one of the sushi chefs explained how it works.  \n\nTypically, I eat special rolls and very little nigiri, but not this night.  With the exception of a few things we chose to order, the chefs fed us their picks.  We had a ton of nigiri.  Everything was really fresh and tasty, particularly the mackeral.  The big eye tuna was really good too.\n\nI tried everything Yelpers suggested.  This was my first time having Fried Pork Belly.  Holy crap!  Where have you been all my life?!  Unbelievably good.  A nice layer of charred fat and the mango salsa that accompanies it was the right amount of sweet.  Honestly, everything we tried was good, with one exception:  No matter how much you think you like spicy DO NOT ORDER THE 911 ROLL!  My mouth is still burning!  Thankfully, they offer $13 pitchers of Sapporo to help with the sting.', 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2011-05-20', 'type': 'review'}

Sometimes I worry about going to a new place with crazy rave reviews as I feel my standards are jilted to high and come out feeling like it was over hyped even if the place is good\n\n I ate words- \n\nlike "yum", "oh that\'s fresh", and "lets get another order". \n\nWe really wanted to try all the specials so we started off there. \n\nToday the chalkboard had:\nBig Eye Tuna- had a richer, tuna taste than regular tuna. \nAnago/Saltwater Eel- this was delish. It\'s softer and less slimy than freshwater and as much as I like unagi, I wish more places would have this. \nJapanese Snapper- this was very delicate of a flavor and very fresh. I find some snapper has a very chewy texture and almost muddy taste. \nAji/Spanish Makerel- this was nice. I like the grated ginger on top, but I love gingery stuff. \nWhite Clam- the BF doesn\'t normally enjoy such thing but even he appreciated the flavor. I thought this was good and must for people who love the chewy nigiris like tako, hokkigai, ika. \n\nRegular nigiri menu:\nCajun Albacore- good seasoning. I appreciate that their ponzu sauce isn\'t overtly citrusy and is much more delicate than other places. There\'s some places that have that "fake" lime taste and kills all other flavor.\nAlbacore- good and fresh\nSuper White \nYellowtail- buttery in texture- very fresh\nMackerel- good, but with the cure+ soy is too salty. 2nd order I asked for ponzu and it was much better this way. \n\nOne thing I noticed about the nigiri cuts is that some have a very faint citrus note on it. Not like someone squeezed lemon, but I suspect that they wipe their blades with a citrus water which imparts a hint of it. If you douse your rice in soy, you won\'t probably taste it, but I barely dip any soy onto my fish. This is something I\'ve seen done in Japan so kudos if that\'s what flavored it. \n\nEven at my current favorite place, there\'s some days where certain fish is just okay. Everything today was fresh and on. The daily specials rotating is a great idea since those are intriguing and were all fresh. \n\nI like there is half rolls- we tried the Calico and Ecstacy which are both pretty decent as far as rolls go. \n\nAppetizers: \nThe famed pork belly was pretty tasty!- Crispy, melty, salty, sweet and tangy balance. \nDynamite- most places but too much mayo. BF liked this and I appreciated it was a bit crispy on top. \nOrgasm salad- nice that you get a little sashimi salad action and it wasn\'t overly dressed or too much greens to fish ratio. \nHamachi Kama- we love yellowtail collars and theirs was good. I wish the skin of it was crispier though....nothing beats when it\'s like fish skin chips, but only one ayce so far grills it to that (Island). \nGrilled Yellowtail- this was on the specials board and was a good piece with some sweet glaze \n\nDessert: I like that you can get more than just one dessert (though some desserts have a 1order pp limit). BF and I shared the green tea creme brulee, green tea cake and tofu cheesecake. The green tea creme brulee was the winner for both of us. It isn\'t light on the matcha though so if you don\'t like the strong green tea taste then it might be a bit much but it is creamy, bittersweet burnt matcha and sugar goodness. \n\nService was great! That was one that put it over the edge for us. Servers checked on us often, was on top of drinks, had some suggestions and were friendly. It wasn\'t too busy until the end of our meal and the service didn\'t suffer just because we weren\'t the only ones there. The sushi chefs were super nice, funny and personable. We had Tony during the first half of dinner then Fredo came in. Fredo is all jokes and curses. I\'m all for it, but just a warning to those who can\'t handle a fucking joke. I also like the decor in here- definitely one of the nicer ambiance ayces around. \n\nWe will be returning soon (and I will be coming sooner for the UYE) ! I feel we might be coming here on a regular and making this our favorite spot if this service and quality stays true.\n\nEDIT- Just wanted to say that the UYE had so many people (25) plus a filled restaurant and our service was still friendly, organized as possible (had separate checks ready for all us) and a reasonable pace on the food. Kudos to the staff! They work really hard here to keep up with the crowd.', 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2011-05-22', 'type': 'review'}

FYI - if you do not have their AYCE, the menu and pricing can be confusing (2.5) Service: messed up bill which my hubby had to actually grab a menu and show the waitress that she was wrong (2), Value: given the experience here, I wouldn\'t come back.(2).\n\nI was enthused to see a highly rated sushi place. So I nagged the hubby to come try this place out. When we arrived. we weren\'t hungry enough to try their AYCE option. Instead we ordered their deluxe bento (with a side salad and miso soup), katsu curry and a side order of the grilled pork belly.\n\nFYI - if you order a la carte, the prices are all on the actual fold-out menu NOT what\'s on the AYCE sheet or the supplement page on the placemat. Make sure you check your bill because we were charged for the more expensive price for pork belly (ie, supplement for the AYCE add- on) instead of the a la carte price. The waitress asked the chef instead of checking the menu and didn\'t believe us. My hubby had to ask for the menu to show her the difference. \n\nThe deluxe bento suffered from many problems but let\'s just start off with the baby upchuck masquerading as some sort of misguided egg salad they put in the top right hand corner. (see pic: http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q&select=pNoiIE--ccKc0V8o2PwRgw) Or perhaps the completely anemic "teriyaki chicken" which didn\'t even have grill marks on them. The fried salmon and tempura were both soggy. We had to ask for tempura sauce. Sashimi - the fish was cut into thick chunks but isn\'t cut in the proper matter allowing the fish to melt in your mouth. For what it\'s worth, the California maki was okay. \n\nThere was little to no katsu with the katsu curry.  (FYI - the cutlet in the photo represents about 40% of the entire cutlet which is rather small for $8 see pic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JyxHvtj-syke7m9rbza7mA?select=tl0GrsOs4ViWjApsgaBvog ). The curry itself was overly thick and bland due to the addition of perhaps too much potatoes.\n\nFinally, the grilled pork belly. While the texture of the pork belly was nice, the flavour of the pork was overly smoky for our tastes. The addition of the rather oddly sour tasting mango salsa was a deteriment to the dish. Certainly not something we would order again and we found it expensive for the price.\n\nOverall given our experience with a la carte, we probably won\'t be stopping by for AYCE. But certainly check your bill if you do decide to do the a la carte tasting.', 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2011-05-22', 'type': 'review'}

This place has been getting rave reviews and now I know why. I walked in on a Thursday night and the place was packed. Luckily, one lone spot at the sushi bar was calling out to me. \n\nEverything I tried was good (except for the uni... but I'm just not a fan of it).\n\nGrilled pork belly - Amazing! One of the best pork belly dishes I've ever had... succulent, juicy, tender, crispy edge, perfect amount of fat... It comes with a mango salsa, but it doesn't need it at all. Eating the pork by itself is the way to go.\n\nUni - I'm not a fan, but wanted to give it another shot since I've only had it a handful of times previously. After trying it here, I still don't like it. It was too salty and texture is not the least bit appealing.\n\nTuna nigiri - fresh, bright, silky texture, not too much rice.\n\nMoon roll - eel, scallop, tempura flakes. Excellent roll, the eel took a backseat to the distinct flavor of the scallop. And, they didn't over-sauce the roll allowing the flavors of the main ingredients to shine.\n\nOrgasm salad - Didn't quite live up to it's name, but still delicious. Nice bit of heat with the spicy chili sauce.\n\nSpicy tuna crispy rice - Loved the crispy rice and the tuna was excellent. Each piece is big and it comes three to an order.\n\nHamachi nigiri - Wonderfully fresh, generous cuts of fish. The slices of fish were so big I couldn't even see the rice it was sitting on.\n\nTofu cheesecake - made in house, this dessert was incredibly rich and creamy.\n\nThe service and experience at the sushi bar was great.

We decided on AYCE and that is definitely the way to go. Price is standard at $26.95. \n\nWe ordered side dishes first: grilled yellow tail collar, fried calamari, grilled pork belly and baked green mussels. Baked green mussels were good but not nearly as good as Sin City Sushi. We liked everything for the most part but the grilled pork belly is something special. The pork belly was juicy, flavorful and melted in my mouth.\n\nWe mostly stuck with nigiri and everything was fresh with not too much rice. The standouts for me were the super white tuna and snow crab meat. Our chef, Mike, suggested a variety of items to try and one of them was rice, raw quail egg and masago wrapped in seaweed. It was surprisingly yummy. \n\nThe only roll we had lived up to it's name, Ecstacy Roll. I can't even remember what was in it but it was good! I like that you can do half orders.\n\nWhat bumped this review up to 5 stars for me were the desserts. The hubby had the green tea creme brulee and I had the tempura ice cream. I wasn't too thrilled with the tempura because it was spongy and not at all crunchy. I did, however, eat most of the green tea creme brulee. It had a good consistency and right amount of sweetness. I still had a little bit of a sweet tooth so I ordered the lychee sorbet. It was so yummy and was a great way to cleanse the palette. \n\nA huge plus was the exceptional service. The sushi chefs were friendly and were gracious enough to suggest different things to try. Our glasses were always full and empty plates were cleared right away. \n\nI am now a believer of the type.

I have to admit that this was my all time favorite sushi experience and definitely a top 3 overall dining experience.\n\nI chose to sit at the bar (which I highly recommend from now on). I chose to do the AYCE and was flabbergasted by the large selection of nigiri, rolls and special rolls they had. You can add appetizers and desserts to the AYCE as well. Sushi Chef Fredo saw that I was completely clueless about what to order so I basically turned the keys over to him. He basically ordered for me, and I have to say that this is the only way to eat sushi from now on. It was an awesome experience. I also appreciated the way Fredo made the nigiri sushi...he didn't overpower the fish with a ton of rice underneath.\n\nHighlights:\n\nPork Belly - At first, i thought the soy sauce marinade was gonna overpower the pork belly and make it really salty, but when i ate, it was incredibly delicate and tender. It is similar to chashu. In addition, the pork belly comes with a side of mango salsa to top off the meat. 5/5\n\nBlue Fin Tuna, Toro, and Super White Tuna Nigiri - These were my top dishes for the night. The blue fin tuna was incredibly soft and tender, which makes it just melt in your mouth. It was freakin decadent. I was told that the toro is the belly of the tuna, which makes sense because it tasted fatty and tender...just the way i like it. And the super white tuna (which i've heard is escolar...not tuna) was also really good. It tasted like butterfish. 5/5\n\nHurricane Roll - the best of the special rolls IMO. It had shrimp tempura and an assortment of other stuff. I think it had rho as well. And it must have been topped with some eel sauce and this other creamy white sauce. I ordered so much, I don't remember what was in it. But i do remember that it tasted balanced and flavorful, and was simply the perfect bite. 5/5\n\nFrying Jason - This is basically a BSCR but the filling had crab sticks and cream cheese. Pretty bomb. 4/5\n\nGrilled Yellowtail Collar - this was also the bomb. you can taste the smokiness from the grill and the fish was light. it felt like you were eating outside your bbq. 4/5\n\nI also ordered: \n\nbaked mussels (fantastic)\n\ndynamite (basically the topping of a BSCR in a shell)\n\norgasmic salad (seared ahi tuna in some greens and lime juice. a bit sour)\n\njala jala roll (your basic roll with spicy tuna in the filling topped with albacore, salmon, tuna, and a slice of chili pepper....pretty good)\n\nscallop nigiri (it was good, but he put a bit too much lime juice on it)\n\nsupreme salmon roll (probably my least favorite. it was a salmon roll topped with salmon. a little overkill)\n\nFinally after all this indulgence, i finished off my meal with some green tea ice cream. delicious. \n\np.s. all the dishes i ordered can be ordered in half orders.", 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2011-05-26', 'type': 'review'}

I thought the previous restaurant was ok, but Goyemon is magnificent. Everything about it is upscale and almost sophisticated without being ridiculously priced. \n\nThe tables are a little close together and it is easy to get caught up in another groups conversation. You should go with a mid size group of 4-6 to truly get the perfect dining experience. The menu for the all you can eat is extensive. To be able to get a full tasting you will need to share and split the duties amongst everyone. Goyemon does it's part by offering many rolls in a half portion size. \n\nKatrina M. and I stuck mainly to the nigiri. The best were the halibut, super white tuna, scallops, and uni. I will devour four orders of halibut by myself and it was better than most places. They use less ponzu sauce on theirs which gives me the impression that there is less to hide. The super white tuna was buttery and melts in your mouth. I am pretty sure I snuck a majority of them away when no one was looking. The scallops had a squeeze of lemon that accentuated the flavors of the shellfish. The sea urchin here is delicious. They were fresh, briny, and creamy.\n\nWe had quite a few cut rolls as well. They all tasted good, but I would stick to the nigiri. The lemon roll was one that stood out above the rest. During the meal, I had wanted to order the Sushi Monster Roll. By mid meal, I was getting too full so I forgot about it. A friend ordered it while no one else was paying attention. We got it as our last roll and regretted every minute of it. One piece is the equivalent of three normal ones. The giant roll has a condense deep fried fish center wrapped in seaweed, rice, soy paper and more rice. If you have a hard time with a spider roll avoid this one. I took the challenge and stuffed the whole piece in my mouth. It was not pretty. \n\nSave room for dessert, because it is all superb.

Lucky for me, Minh D knew about this awesome place that is located off the strip and is moderate priced       ($26.95 for AYCE) and open till 3:00am. Parking wasnt bad and we were warmly welcomed and seated at a table right away.\nHungry and not knowing what to order first (I love sushi and could probally eat my weight in it). Minh said he was getting the AYCE which was unlimited sushi that had to be consumed in 60minutes with no left over rice on the plates, if there was any traces of sushi or rice left overs they would charge you A La Carte prices. You can not share with other non AYCE people at your table, however you can share if anyone at your table is partaking in the AYCE challenge which is a good thing and highly recommended!!

Taking a rest and also walking around the food just wasnt wanting to settle. Sadly i had to tap out half way through the challenge.

After all the rave reviews, I was doubly excited to finally get here for dinner one night with all my friends.\n\nWe had a pretty large party, around 12 people, so we got here around 7 hoping to get a table by 7:30. The wait really wasn't very long, considering how small the restaurant is. I've been to this location before when it was Sushi Hana and then again when it was Shin and I was pleasantly surprised by the interior of this restaurant. They really did wonders to make it much more cozy and upscale looking than the previous two restaurants that occupied this space.\n\nBeing owned by the same owners of Sushi Mon, the menus are quite similar and the quality is on par. With the addition of some special menu items and a more attractive restaurant interior and couple that with the relative proximity to my home, I'll definitely be making this place my go-to AYCE sushi place from now on!\n\nI was happily eating as much of the grilled veggies and pork belly as I could get my hands on. The grilled tofu salad was also delightful and light. These were some stars on the non-sushi side of the menu. I'll definitely be getting these items again on my next visit. I didn't try a lot of the specialty rolls and stuck mainly to the nigiri and cooked items. I was really interested in the salmon or yellowtail collar, as that's usually a favorite of mine at Sushi Mon, but they were out unfortunately. That will definitely be on the top of my to-do list for next time. Everything was fresh and yummy, I can't even say anything outshone another dish as I loved everything I tried.\n\nAnother positive about this place is the AYCE option for desserts, since there are often quite a few desserts I am interested in trying at one time. I tried a little from everyone's order and my favorites were the green tea cr\xe8me bruelee and the tofu cheesecake. The others were pretty good as well. \n\nJust a note - make sure you bring your stamp card from Sushi Mon when you come since they share a stamp card. Definitely worth the trip, I'll be back...

If so, no need to ask anymore, because this is it!! THE BEST ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI JOINT IN TOWN! WITHOUT A DOUBT!\n\nWHAT: Firstly, we got to test out the new party room! There were 20 of us sushi-eaters ready to devour and take advantage of that AYCE sushi menu! The servers were all dolls! They were extremely helpful (knowing how hectic a large party can be) and us paying separately did not scare them at all. They were well-prepared! COOL points for the staff that night!\n\nSo, on to the food! I would just like to state the fact that each dish was made with such perfection! From the many attractive flavors, to the presentation!\n\nSOME THINGS I TRIED:\n\nOrgasm salad: Something a little bit different! The sauce blend had a little tang and zest to it, which actually made the salad.\n\nPastel roll: shrimp and crab wrapped inside soy paper, shrimp and avocado on top, slightly drizzled with spicy yum & eel sauce on top!\n\n911 roll: To all of you spice-aholics, you need to try this one! I personally thought that I would be able to take some HEAT, but I had to LEAVE THE KITCHEN for this one! After several drinks of water and patiently waiting it out, the spice stuck to my tongue! So, the tip for this roll: BEWARE, AND PROCEED WITH CAUTION! haha\n\nI LOVE BAKED ROLLS! So, I love the fact that they have a handful of great ones!\nO.I.D. roll: shrimp & asparagus wrapped in salmon & baked with yumyum sauce! Oh whatt?!!\nBaked 428: I had to try this one just because it said baked chicken inside the roll! I have never tried a chicken roll =)\nGoyemon lasagna roll: I love japanese lasagna rolls, so I always try it in every sushi spot. & this won my heart over! My absolute favorite lasagna roll of all time!\n\nDESSERT! Oh how I love the end of beautiful beginnings solely due to dessert! So... there are a couple of desserts you may choose from on the ayce menu, (tempura, mochi, etc) meaning you can get as much as you\'d like?! There is a separate dessert menu you can choose from as well, where you are only allowed to pick one on there! And on this beautiful menu lay "GREEN TEA CREME BRULEE," which happened to be my pick! =D It was completely marvelous!\n\nLastly, I would like to give a shoutout to my fellow yelper, Nelson Q., for introducing me to such greatness! You got me hooked, my friend! So hooked that I will be back there next week!\n\nWINNER, WINNER, SUSHI DINNER!', 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2011-06-23', 'type': 'review'}

Revolutionary! \n\nOr not.\n\nOwned by the same people who own Monta and Sushi-Mon, this is another addition to their Japanese cuisine monopoly. As such, the resemblance to either restaurant is no surprise. In fact, just like Sushi-Mon they offer a small selection of special fish options for the day. When we arrived the only option they had available was their in-house smoked salmon, which was alright. \n\nThe highlights: \n* Braised Pork belly. Pork belly is gelatinous, fatty and delicious by itself, but given the right TLC and it\'s a porky palate pleaser. This is no different, but it\'s best eaten in small doses. The portion size is meager so that takes care of that. Flavors and textures are great on this one. \n* Raw scallop nigiri. Not the "scallop dynamite" smothered in mayo, this is real, tender scallop. It\'s delicious and rare to find in an AYCE place! \n* Uni was fresh, not murky tasting. \n\nLowlights:\n* Baked green mussels. Blah! Bluefin\'s are better.\n* Orgasm Salad. I\'d take a hundred screaming O\'s over this any day. Boo. Weird medley of assorted fish-chunks doused in a puddle of ginger-sesame dressing and a few wilted greens doesn\'t bring orgasm to mind at all- unless you mean that wet spot in the bed nobody wants to sleep on... \n* Masago & Quail egg- I\'d asked for Ikura but the chef assured me it was usually made with masago. Didn\'t float my boat OR sink my submarine. \n\n\nThe interior is nice, with lots of warm wooden tones throughout and low-hanging lamps.\n\nThe service could be spotty. There was confusion over who was actually taking our appetizer/drink orders and a lot of shouting back and forth from the sushi bar to the servers. \n\nI\'d rate this a 3 and a half star place. The food isn\'t awful and the service wasn\'t consistently bad, it just didn\'t blow me out of the water. I was tempted to go for a 4 star, but I figured rounding down will help counter the ebulliently high prior ratings.\n\nI\'m willing to give them another chance and try some of their specialty rolls, but it\'s a bit out of the way and didn\'t make me want to do a dance of belly-joy at the end of my meal.', 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2011-06-28', 'type': 'review'}

My dad had wanted to try this one sushi place my aunt recommended. After searching through Yelp, we decided to go Sushi House Goyemon instead of our original dinner plans because of the high rating on Yelp. \n\nSince we had a larger party (about 15 people), we waited a little bit over 30 min. Most of us did the AYCE which was $26.95/person (no discounted price for children). The menu is HUGE! They had so many appetizers, salads, rolls, sashimi, and desserts to choose from on the AYCE menu. I was impressed and wish I could have tried them all. They had a lot of items that I usually only see on the regular menus that are not for AYCE. Since it was a while ago that I went, I can't remember them all... but some that popped out were grilled yellowtail collarbone, cold tofu, wakame (seaweed salad), green tea creme brulee... just to name a few. The sashimi was so fresh!! DROOOOOL! it makes me hungry just to think about it! hahaha\n\nAlthough the food selection was great, the service was so so slooooooooow. Half of my party got full just from waiting for the rest of their food to come out and ended up not eating that much. It seemed like they forgot some of our food so we would ask them to check up on it. As a result, we got double of our order, which is a plus except when you don't feel like an having an excessive amount of the same thing.

But when my brother and his friend decided to go to Sushi House Goyemon, I had to go.\n\nWe all decided to do the the AYCE, and from the taste of the appetizers, I was glad we did. From the Spicy Tuna Rice Cracker (rice deep-fried then topped with spicy tuna and yum yum sauce) to the Seaweed Salad to the orgasmic Pork Belly, I was in love at first course. Then, within 2.5 seconds, Katrina M. and my brother ordered nigiri in endless quantities - some of the standouts were the Garlic Tuna (an absolute favorite), Super White Tuna, Eel, and the Scallop. All of which were incredibly fresh; if it weren't for Vegas being landlocked, I could have sworn the Uni was plucked straight from the sea. As for rolls, we ordered the Lemon Roll, which was perfect in all of its citrusy lightness.\n\nDessert was not even the end of it! With options of Green Tea Creme Brulee (though I am not as convinced on it as my brother is), Mochi, and Green Tea Cake, my absolute favorites were the Lychee Sorbet and Tofu Cheesecake. The former is light enough that I can justify ordering two bowls. The latter combines my two favorite things in the world into one non-guilt-inducing dessert! With the tartness of the mangoes, I can't help but feel okay eating the Tofu Cheesecake - hey, at least I'm eating some fruit too!\n\nGoyemon is certainly smart - not only is AYCE 27 dollars and worth every penny in quantity and quality, but it doesn't mess around with the nonsense of being open for lunch.

I had the tofu cheesecake and my friend, the tempura ice cream. You know how most places put a limit on just 1 dessert?

Not me!\n\nThis place was the bomb.com! (not trademarked)\n\nMy fiance and I stayed at a timeshare directly next to a small shopping center off of Decatur Blvd.  Normally we would go towards the strip to eat at one of the many great places to eat, but we decided to eat nearby on Wednesday evening.  What a great choice that was.  Well, on to the food!\n\nWe walked in and were greeted immediately.  Smiles all around and were seated right away.  The hostess asked if we had been there before and we responded no, but we might be returning again in the future.  We sat down and were asked if we planned to order from the "A la carte" menu or just going to have the highly recommended "All you can eat" menu.  $26.95 for all you can eat?  Sure!  Why not?  We were pleasantly surprised to find out that it wasn\'t your typical pre-made rolls or crappy appetizers to choose from ... In fact, it was the whole freaking menu!  Everything we had wanted and more!  For $26.95?  Not too shabby!  Now, I am not typically a heavy eater, but when I am on vacation in Las Vegas, I am going to EAT!  \n\nWe started by ordering some Salmon and Tuna sushi.  4 Pieces for each of us.  Had some calamari and some edamame to go with it.  The sushi pieces were pretty fresh considering we were in a desert.  The edemame, well it\'s edemame, you can\'t really screw it up right?  The calamari was pretty good, nothing to write home about, but I would (will) order it again.  Then we moved onto the rolls and ordered a salmon roll and a specialized roll that I requested.  They didn\'t have anything on the menu that had Avocado, Mango, and Tuna.  I wanted all of these things together and can normally find a roll with those contents in Orange County at just about any Sushi place.  They conjured it up for me with some mango salsa they had, sliced Avocado, and some good tuna.  The rolls were good in size and pretty flavorful.  This was the point where normally I would think about calling it a night ... but tonight was ALL YOU CAN EAT!  \n\nWe moved on to the crazy good stuff.  Grilled pork belly with mango salsa?  Insanely good!  I normally stay away from pork, but the waiter insisted I tried it ... thank you Odin!  (The waiter was named Odin by the way)  And with the pork we had an order of the grilled veggies.  The veggies were amazing.  I don\'t know how much butter or what type of seasoning they added to these vegetables, but they were so good we immediately ordered another order.  It consisted of asparagus, mushrooms, and cherry tomatoes.  Just for good measure I ordered a few more pieces of sushi just to fill me to the brim.\n\nLast but not least we ordered the desserts.  We had a green tea creme brulee (which was divine) and some green tea ice cream.  The desserts ended the meal perfectly.  All and all we probably ate about $80 worth of food for about $54.  \n\nI have to give a special shout out to Odin.  We had some complications with ordering drinks in the beginning and he was very accommodating and gave some great recommendations.  I left him a huge (well deserved) tip.  Next time we go back to Vegas, we will absolutely have to stop at Goyemon!\n\nEnjoy!\n\n-Steven', 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2011-08-20', 'type': 'review'}

The first time I went, it was on a weekday night for dinner with one other person.  We both did the AYCE and the service was fine.  The next time I went was on a Saturday night with a group of about 8 people.  So, unfortunately, this review is going to be based on my second visit.\n\nFirst, we called about 3 hours in advance to see if we could make a reservation.  The person who answered told my friend that they were booked until late that night, then asked how many were in our party.  My friend told her 8 and then she said they only made reservations for parties of 10 or larger, so my friend told her 10, then she asked what time we would like our reservation.  Huh, I thought you were all booked up?\n\nAnyway, so when the reservation time came, only 4 of us had shown up on time.  The server was getting anxious and frustrated that the entire party wasn\'t there (as if that was our fault?).  I understand how the server was feeling as it is a small place, but there was definitely no line of people outside the door waiting to be seated.  Had there been, I\'m sure we would have been a lot more understanding.  Plus, he was expressing his frustration to us, which I thought was inappropriate.  \n\nThis is where it gets good.  We finally had our 8 show up, plus an unexpected 1 after we had given away a two-top table (reserved as part of our initial "10-person" reservation).  The extra person had to share a seat with someone else and was never once offered by the server to grab an extra seat!  We had plenty of room in our area to accomodate this person, but instead, someone from our party had to grab a spare chair himself.  What the heck?!\n\nRolls were slow, but it was busy, so that was somewhat understandable.  I just don\'t understand how the server was getting so frustrated when we were all doing AYCE and some of us were ordering beers... I feel like he should have been pretty happy knowing that he would be making bank off of us. \n\nI would probably venture to say that almost everyone in the group was disappointed with the service and some expressed that by leaving a tip that was appropriate for such service.  The sad part is, the decision to go to this sushi joint was based off of a Yelp recommendation and my previous experience with the place, but only AFTER we had called Oyshi and were told that it was packed.  We probably would have had a better experience waiting at Oyshi!  This is definitely not the level of service I would expect from the same people who own Sushi-Mon.

Like most places they say you have a one hour time limit but the waiter was always around if we wanted to order more and believe me we ordered enough to feed a family of four and it was only two of us. \n\nFirst thing on the menu that caught my eye was pork belly. I know most of my reviews mention pork but c\'mon "ALL YOU CAN EAT PORK BELLY" I was like a kid in a candy store. The pork is braised to perfect tenderness and lightly grilled for that chard flavor. Another thing that was unique was their Spicy Tuna Fire Cracker. The crunchy texture of the rice and soft spicy tuna tantalizes your taste buds. I tend to order most of the Nigiri sushi and the quality of their fish and seafood is tops! \n\nThe only thing I would say was "so so" was their deserts with the exception of their lychee sorbet. But its OK by this time I was comatose from all that sushi goodness. \n\nI would have to say Goyemon has set the bar pretty high for me when it comes to AYCE sushi.', 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2011-08-22', 'type': 'review'}

If you have a dish with only one piece of fish, I think you should make it look good. But then again, this isn\'t Raku...\n\nWe thought the nigiri was fine, but not the greatest quality - there was also a point when our second round of tuna and yellowtail nigiri tasted very "fishy." Our happiness factor went mostly to the cold tofu and other grilled specials. Also, the desserts were great and UNIQUE. Most AYCEs serve the standard mochi/ice cream (not that it\'s not delicious).

(After all, this location once housed Sushi Hana and SHIN Yakitori.)\n\nOpen only for dinner from 5:00 pm to 3:00 am, we made it our mission to be waiting when the doors open.  We weren't the only ones on a Sunday night to think of this, but were definitely glad we did.\n\nBeyond the standard sushi rolls and sushi, what makes Sushi House Goyemon a star higher than others?  These were noteworthy in my book:\n\n* Specials board: Oh my goodness!  This is what got me!  They had off the standard menu fish like bonito, kampachi, sardines, and yuzu tobiko that were included in AYCE.  That was definitely a highlight in my book!  Loving the yuzu tobiko!\n\n* Pork Belly - Yes, everyone talks about it and it's good stuff.  We love pork belly - we have marinated cooked pork belly sitting in our freezer ready to throw into the rice cooker at a moment's notice.  We love pork belly.  Sure, the portion is a meager two pieces at a time, but it's AYCE, so order up more!\n\n* Shoyu Ramen is included in AYCE after 11 pm.  Sure, we missed this, but it got the Husband all excited with the possibility of it.  (Why someone would want to fill their belly with ramen and soup during an AYCE sushi fest is beyond me.)\n\n* Dessert included, as in ALL the desserts are included!  I've been to other AYCE sushi joints that may or may not included AYCE ice cream, but they not only have a few ice cream flavors, but four different desserts to choose from.  Uh, score a point there!  We tried them all - Green Tea Cake, Chocolate Mousse, Plum Wine Jelly, and Green Tea Creme Brulee.\n\n* Hot or Iced Green Tea is included.\n\nSo, what's with all the mixed reviews?  The major problem here is service.  I read over the recent reviews and took note of the declining service and definitely can attest to what the other yelpers are complaining about.  We were lucky that Chizuru was our primary waitress because she is stellar.  And the rest of the staff, that's the problem.  From the moment we walked in and said party of four and one highchair, the hostess/waitress totally forgot to bring a highchair.  Other staff people were just not attentive, as I was often seen waving my arms around to get their attention.  Waiters who refill your beverages should really put your glass back in front of you, not at the other end of the table and watch you struggle to reach across to get it.  There are just some people who are just really good at restaurant service and others that could use some improvement\n\nNonetheless, we've been gone so long from the AYCE world that we are happy to go back.  Yeah, we'll be back this week!\n\n4.5 stars.\n\nThey offer a frequent eater card, which is always nice.  Looks like they are related to Sushi Mon and Monta Ramen as well.

I first asked if they had eaten at Goyemon prior to our visit, which they confirmed that they had, multiple times.  So that was my first indication that this place wouldn't be too shabby.\n\nWe arrived at a modestly decorated space with a fifteen minute wait for six people at 1AM on a Friday night.  The interior has mood lighting, with a gorgeous, clean bathroom and an overall generic but pleasant decor.  \n\nTo get a good sampling of what the restaurant offered, I decided to spend the 26.95 to get the AYCE which isn't just sushi, but included all kitchen food, entrees, and dessert.  That way, if the sushi was mediocre, I could pig out on entrees and kitchen food.  \n\nThankfully, that was not the case as the sushi was pretty good.  I ended up eating a lot of the Americanized rolls which as a whole I generally don't care for, but every once in a while I do end up finding a roll that has a ton of goobledegook on it and enjoying it.  I for one like my sushi to be light and have a distinctly smooth taste to it.  So this place worked for me.  I had two orders of shumai (steamed/fried), gyoza, eight half orders of sushi, 1/2 order of ramen, and Green Tea Cake, the latter of which was my favorite part of the meal.  And yes, you read that prior part right: You can do half orders of sushi, which I loved, since this gave you the ability to a variety of sushi rather than get stuck with a roll that was so-so in your ranking.  \n\nIn terms of sushi: Sexy Girl, Cynthia, and Dragon all stood out for me.  \n\nThe only thing I really didn't care for was the service.  It started off fantastic.  Speedy, tons of refills on my iced green tea.  And then, towards the end, I was waiting and waiting and waiting to get a refill of water.  The staff was pleasant, and the food was good, very good for an AYCE.", 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2011-09-17', 'type': 'review'}

Hmph...it was not the best idea and here are the reasons why:\n\n1. When we got there around 7:45pm, Saturday night, the place was packed...and I mean packed as in it's super small and doesn't have much seating available, so when you include the AYCE option, I can tell why the wait here is always LONG. We waited for over 45 minutes before a table finally decided to get their bootays up and leave. Even though, the waitress was kind enough to offer the 3 of us seating at the bar, we opted to get a regular table and let the bar be available for the couples/singles.\n\n2. The AYCE menu is quite confusing. You can't have everything all-you-can-eat...meh?? There were certain items on there were you were only allowed one order per person. So the math did get confusing for me. I'm no bueno with numbers here people!\n\n3. FOOD: The pork belly that everyone raved about was MEH for me. The sushi rolls were also A-OK, nothing too crazy besides the nutso 9-11 roll we ordered. That habanero sauce they used on that roll had my mouth feelin like Angelina Jolie for a good 1/2 hour. OMG! The sashimi and fresh fish was very fresh indeed and those orders always came out the quickest. The chicken skewers were...what they were, just chicken skewers with Teriyaki sauce all ova em, again...nothing special there. The ONLY thing I really did enjoy was the AYCE option of DESSERTS! Mmmm, mmm bombalicous! I had 2 of the green tea creme brulees (which were sooooo decadent and perfect) and 1 red bean ice cream, how can you go wrong with anything that has beans in it? Yes, I'm Asian and I love my beany desserts! =P\n\n4. SERVICE: It got kinda confusing who our server was. There were some dudes that would come out with our order but didn't take our order and then we had about 3 waiters that did take our orders back & forth. Major minus? Food came out WAY too slow-momo. I know there are only about 3 chefs working, but the place is tiny and I've been to plenty AYCE sushi spots and never had to wait about 15 min between each order. I'm ALWAYS hungry! Especially now since I'm still in precontest season for my fitness competition, so if I'm looking forward to a cheat meal, it better be top notch and the food better come out FAST. Sushi House Goyemon did NOT do this job well.\n\nWould I come back? For the desserts? Yes. But even that's not really worth the trip there.\n\nP.S. We had to hit up Jean Philippe Patisserie at the ARIA (since it's the only thing open super late and close to our hotel) right after we left this spot cuz my ass was still HUNGRY as EFF!", 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2011-09-28', 'type': 'review'}

Ambiance - Very nice, good sushi that seem to easily seat about 15 or so.  About 9-11 tables, I really did not count.  Party room that is real comfy for about 12 people, yeah, the same 12 that can fit all in one elevator. If you are not one of them, be careful and suck it in!  I like the place and ambiance.\n\n3.  Reservations - Only for large parties. If you go during dinner, you will probably wait. We went on a Wednesday at 7:30 for a party of 6 and it was about a 50 minute wait.\n\n4.  Service - Pretty darn good, attitude a 5+ and knowledge was same.  If they would explain why some peeps that seemed to just show up and get seated right away , then it would go from pretty darn good to freakin amazing!\n\n5.  Food - I am a traditionalist, so they had my favorites that were tasty like Ikura, Uni, Amai-ebi, fried ebi heads, Ikura,  They had all the wild complex rolls that many like to order now and while I don't recall all the names, they were all so very good.  They even made one that my fellow muncher specified and it turned out really great!\n\nThe people here are great, the food great, the ambiance great. You cannot go wrong.

Goyemon does everything right.  Firstly, they have a vast selection of rolls, the creativity is certainly there.  Additionally, the service is good, the servers were attentive and made sure everyone in my party had their drinks filled at all times.  \n\nAs far as sheer quality is concerned, I feel that Sushi Mon has the edge.  I hate to make this a comparative review because I'm sure that Goyemon has worked feverishly to create its own image, however, I feel that it's just something I can't help only because I always feel the need to rank restaurants.  It gives me a better sense of where to go, especially if I'm on time constraints.\n\nI will give Goyemon the edge on their pricing, which is two dollars less than Sushi Mon's.  Goyemon charges $26,95 for AYCE sushi, which isn't bad in relation to what is charged elsewhere in the city.  Goyemon also allows unlimited dessert orders, which is exciting, especially once you taste the Fried Ice Cream Tempura.  I have no shame in saying I enjoyed three separate orders.  The lychee ice cream was also a highlight of my meal.  \n\nGoyemon is a great place to satiate the sushi urge in you.", 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2011-10-04', 'type': 'review'}

I could probably have eaten it all night...\n\nI had to try at least one roll, so I went for the sexy girl. Pretty appropriate order for Vegas, right? It wasn't the best I've ever had but it was quite good and also quite a mouthful. I guess I might skip out on the rolls next time at the risk of killing my momentum again.\n\nThe best and worst part of the night: I don't even remember reading about chocolate mousse while getting my Yelp scouting report, but that dessert is ridiculously good. Great creamy texture, great chocolate flavor, great complementary crunchy texture from the gold-colored flakes. The green tea creme brulee was good but definitely not as special, and unfortunately I didn't get to too many of the other desserts.\n\nI'd love to go again if it weren't so expensive. Maybe I'll eat super cheap stuff for a few months and justify another trip...", 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2011-10-17', 'type': 'review'}

Sushi House Goyemon, with it's top notch selection of nigiri, sushi rolls, and cooked platters is Vegas' answer to this call. \n\nWe went on a weekday night and following Yelp advice arrived early.  Good thing too.  Even though it was a mid week dinner, the place filled to capacity and soon there were people waiting.\n\nWe were lucky and snagged a seat at the sushi bar, where many regulars sit.  The nigiri comes out quickly and you can place orders directly with the sushi chef instead of flagging their busy wait staff. \n\nNigiri - very good nigiri especially for AYCE. Highlights were bonito, the super white tuna, conch, uni, and amaebi.  Cons are that you are limited to only one order per person for uni and hotate.  Still though, loved the fresh cuts, minimal rice used (ie: no filler) and great selection.  Oahu's Hakone with unlimited toro, uni, and amaebi may rank higher but this place has good nigiri.  A steal. \n\nSushi rolls - a variety of baked, fried, and fresh rolls are available and you can even order half orders.  Win. \n\nCooked dishes - after hearing so much about the pork belly, I admit I was disappointed by that dish and the cooked dishes here.  No agedashi tofu, no chawan mushi, and they ran out of hamachi and salmon kama.  \n\nAppetizers - really enjoyed the seafood salad, poke tuna, and surf clam salad.  \n\nOverall, we had a great meal at Sushi Goyemon.  At $26.95, it's an incredible value if you love nigiri.  The izakaya dishes are lacking but the desserts were great.  \n\nSushi House Goyemon accepts credit cards, including Amex.\n\nMy Buffet Rankings:\n\n1) Westin at the Bund, Shanghai - $60/person and an excellent selection of sashimi, seafood, roasted suckling pig and fresh hand tossed Chinese noodles.  \n2) Hakone - all-you-can eat toro, uni, kobe beef, and amaebi, $60/pp.  \n\n3) Sushi House Goyemon - truly great nigiri, many great appetizers, and desserts and an unbelievable price, $26/pp\n4) Navio at The Ritz Carlton - only down a slot secondary to the astronomical price ($88/price) but made up for with a spectacular view, top notch service and great food.\n5) Bellagio, Las Vegas - congee, prime rib, shrimp/crab", 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2011-11-05', 'type': 'review'}

Vegas has a sea of sushi spots, so I imagine it\'s hard to stand out and really impress. Somehow, Goyemon manages to do so. It\'s hard to explain, but I think it\'s just the intangibles that put Goyemon in a special place in my sushi-loving heart.\n\nOK so the truth is that I\'ve only been here twice. But both times were with a large group of fantastic friends. So maybe that has something to do with it. Both times were in the private room off to the side and we had reservations, so I\'ve never had to wait for a table. And most importantly, both times, the sushi was top notch.\n\nMy favorite memory of this place was when my cousin and I decided to order every single nigiri item on their AYCE menu. Yep. We simply told the server, "1 through 27." Doesn\'t get any easier than that! They brought out our nigiri in batches of 9 pairs. It was like nigiri heaven. Probably the only negative I can even think of is that they don\'t have tobiko. I need my tobiko with quail egg! Oh well. Masago with quail egg works too.\n\nGoyemon also has a good selection of non-sushi items. Did someone say pork belly? Don\'t mind if I do. And their dessert. Maybe I should have started the review with dessert. Hands down, Goyemon has the best selection of any AYCE in town--lychee sorbet, plum wine jelly, tempura ice cream, and much more.

Now, mind you, it would all be our first time, but I was down! There's such a thing called hungry eyes and I don't mean Patrick Swayze in Dirty Dancing and my eyes were not satisfied let alone my royal palette ;) I start off by warming up my stomach with my usual orders of nigiri (fresh water eel, salmon, and Cajun albacore), seaweed salad, and green mussels! The preliminary order had satisfactory flavor, but I did notice that they put very little rice! I liked that part! I noticed that the friends I was with was not very happy with their service and that took a toll on my experience. \n\nI believe a restaurant MUST understand how to treat and serve their patrons well FIRST and then deliver with high quality food or products! However, service seemed to be at the bottom of their priorities; at least for us it was.\n\nIf my friends aren't happy, I'm not happy. And when I'm not happy, you get 2 stars! 1 for being open during lunch and 2 for having an AYCE sushi during lunch for $21.95. The sushi was subpar, the appetizers were decent but not wow, and the atmosphere was not as welcoming or friendly as others in the Valley.

And that's saying a lot, because I've been been a big fan and a regular of Sushi Mon for the past six years. However, at the end of the night, I get a stamp card (buy 10 ACYEs and get one free), and it has Sushi Mon's  E. Sahara location on it as well. I came to the conclusion that Sushi House Goyemon has the same owner?\n\nI was impressed with the quality of the fish and the relatively small portion of rice that came with the nigiri. Many ACYE places give huge portions of rice and miniscule pieces of fish. I may be exaggerating a bit, but you know what i mean. The ploy of most of these places is to get you full quicker by giving you bigger chunks of rice. Not at Goyemon.\n\nSome of my highlights:\n-Uni nigiri (very fresh)\n-Since I'm a huge fan of spicy tuna, I have to try every sushi joint's spicy tuna roll. The spicy tuna had a tarty/sour kick to it giving it a very exotic flavor, which I thoroughly enjoyed\n-Crispy Rice Roll (Fried Cali Roll with spicy tuna on top drizzled with eel sauce and spicy mayo)\n- Seared tuna (perfectly seared and very fresh tuna)\n- Hirame sushi (delicate, melted in my mouth)\n- Green Tea Cake (creamy and not too sweet)\n- Lychee ice cream (Heaven)\n\nI deducted 0.5 stars, because we had to wait about 15-20 minutes for the rest of our sushi and rolls to come out.

I've been craving AYCE sushi for months, so after getting some hot green tea, we got down to business and ordered:\n\nNigiri: tuna, garlic tuna, seared tuna, super white tuna (3 orders), yellowtail, salmon albacore, cajun albacore, halibut, and unagi (2 orders)\n\nRegular rolls: Full order of the cut fresh water eel roll and salmon skin roll \n\nSpecial rolls: Half orders of the Orion roll, another special roll whose name I forgot and O.I.D. baked roll\n\nAppetizers: edamame, miso soup, shrimp tempura, vegetable tempura (2 orders), steamed gyoza, and yakitori\n\nDessert: green tea ice cream and lychee sorbet (always order the two together...you won't regret it!)\n\nI was slightly disappointed that the nigiri took a while to come out as I had placed most of the order all at once. Then again, I think it's to make sure we don't order more!! The nigiri was damn good, though the rice was a little dry and the super white tuna started to taste buttery during the second and third helping. I also noticed that the nigiri, towards the end of our meal, started to get narrower and smaller. The O.I.D. baked roll was very delicious and I recommend the half order for those who want to try a variety of rolls without getting full from eating 8 pieces of it. The tempura wasn't heavily fried, which I enjoyed, especially the onion ring, since you can really taste the freshness with each bite. You can tell the gyoza was not from the freezer section, so you have to make up for the 2 pieces that come with each order by ordering more. The yakitori didn't have a lot of flavor in it and for a chicken skewer, was quite chewy.\n\nService was excellent, though as it got busier after 12:30 pm, you can tell the servers were starting to get overwhelmed. We had placed our last order in of the vegetable tempura, yakitori, miso soup, and the green tea ice cream and other than the miso soup, it took over 20 minutes to get everything else. I mean, you can easily scoop out the ice cream from the container -- not sure why it would take that long. We also had to remind them of our order since we were getting scared that they forgot to put it in. \n\nIt's been three days and I am already itching to go back for more AYCE sushi.

Whatever you order you must finish. If there is anything left on your plate they will charge you for it. Luckily, for the nigiri they don't add Alot of rice so you won't get full too fast. we quickly ordered and wrote everything down on the paper menu so we could keep track of everything we ordered. \n\nFor the uni (sea urchin) you only get one order per person, along with the amaebi (sweet shrimp). Ask for the shrimp head as well!! It's Delish!! You won't regret it!! \nThe porkbelly was just okay. It was a little too sweet and fatty for my liking.

That includes the daily specials board, the hot apps and dessert selections on the placemats.  All they ask is you finish what you order and not waste food.  Sounds fair to me!\n\nI am not going to review every single item I have tried over the last dozen visits.  But as great as this place is to dine at, the experience can totally be improved if you got with a few friends.  At least this way you can try more things on the menu before you have to throw up the white flag, wiggle your tummy and find a little more room for the desserts.\n\nEven if you are not into raw fish as some of your buddies are, there are plenty of cooked items available for you to order. You can dine here with your foodie buddies without having to feel left out.\n\nThe staff here is great!  Even when they are slammed (pretty much anytime after 7pm) they still managed to deliver on good or better service.  Just show up early or have some patience, as the average wait here for dinner is at least an hour.\n\nFood: 4.5/5 The food and the selection is very good.\n\nFlavor: 4.5/5 Overall very very good, although some nigiri are drenched in too much ponzu sauce.\n\nService: 5/5 I have never had a bad experience here.\n\nDecor:  4.5 Pretty trendy and there are decorative samurai swords in the loo.\n\nParking: 4.5/5 The parking lot is not super big, but you can usually find a parking spot when you drop in for dinner.\n\nPrice:  4/5  Comparable to other local AYCE sushi restaurants in Las Vegas.\n\nValue:  5/5  Only sashimi is not available as part of AYCE.  Their available selection is crazily extensive.\n\n4.5 stars easily!', 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2012-01-05', 'type': 'review'}

I LOVE SALMON.  we ate tons and tons of nigiri, from scallops to crab, to salmon, of course, to ebi, to sweet shrimp, to uni. we sprinkled our nigiri craze with some great sides. the grilled calamari, shrimp tempura, seaweed salad, cajun salmon, pork belly, baked mussels, and mochi ice creams were amazing. the orgasm salad, super white tuna, lychee sorbet, green tea creme brulee were so-so. next time i come back, i want to try some of their rolls! can't wait!!!!", 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2012-01-07', 'type': 'review'}

Salmon, Albacore, Yellowtail, Halibut, Salmon roe nigiri - We enjoyed them all. I think I liked the Yellowtail the best out of this group.\n\n6. Pork belly with mango salsa - Grilled with burnt tips and everything. I topped my sliver of belly with the mango salsa and took it all in on one bite. Wow, it just melted in my mouth. Warning: It's sinfully fatty.\n\n7. Green tea creme brulee & Green tea and Red bean ice cream - I liked all 3 items. Don't expect anything novel from these desserts.

After most of us had arrived, we waited about 30-45 minutes to be seated, because the restaurant policy states that your entire party must be present before being seated. (We were not informed of this when the reservation was made)  The policy was strictly upheld for about half an hour before our server decided to bend the policy and allow us to sit down because half of our party were waiting in the cold for the last half hour due to space restrictions in the entryway, AND we were on the verge of leaving.)  If that wasn\'t enough, it grew worse in a hurry.\n\n     The server "GIO" was blatantly unprofessional;  no greeting, calling attention to us by shouting "Yo" or "Hey" from across the room, handing off ALL of our food to one person and instructing that person to pass it to someone else and so forth.  Every time he came to the table, he had either forgot something, made a mistake, or didn\'t order something for us yet.   IT TOOK 20 MINUTES TO GET THE ONLY BEER I ORDERED...\n\n     He referred to some of us as "dog, dude, bro" and "that chick over there", repeatedly forgot to place our orders, and acted as though we were wasting HIS time.  At times we had to guess what the different rolls were, because there was little effort on his part to state what they were, he didn\'t even know what some of them were himself!  The drink order was also a mess, and our table grew STACKED with empty plates before he decided to do anything about it.  We were also handed the bill by a different server before we got a chance to order dessert.  WTF!?  We paid in advance anyway to be polite.  By the time we had finished paying, only half our desserts were on the table, and predictably, the rest NEVER came, so we cancelled them.  \n\n     For an AYCE sushi spot, some of us didn\'t eat very much because we had few chances to order food in one hour of service, because of all the setbacks, mistakes, and lack of effort.', 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2012-01-10', 'type': 'review'}

The only thing this place lacks, is creativity, you're not going to get anything visually spectacular. Nor will it be anything you've never tried before, but you better believe it will be fresh! Order whatever you like and it probably won't disappoint. Their uni is not that great, but their sweet shrimp is amazing and full of flavor which more than makes up for that. One order allowed of each per person.\n\nGrilled items - Salmon and yellowtail prepared in ways that I can't recall right now. The size of a nice thick cut of sashimi, both delicious.\n\nVeggies - Cucumber salad was fresh and made a nice palate cleanser. Orgasm salad wasn't as good as we remembered it, but It was still good.\n\nDessert - Green tea cake was delicious, but where did the tofu cheese cake go?!?!\n\nFinal thoughts - GO HERE GO HERE GO HERE GO HERE GO HERE!\nSkip the club like we did, wear something roomy, and why not drink a little before during and after.

The service is actually really good they take your order and bring them out in a fairly amount of time and they don't constantly bother you which is pretty good. \n\nFood: The Nigiri sushi here is the best part of this place, Big slices of raw fish with minimum rice. So you don't get full off the rice but also with the fish. That's pretty much all I order and the food comes out in a fairly good amount of time. The sides I usually order is Ahi poke and seaweed salad & I love the portions. The rolls, I'm not much of a roll person but my boyfriend is. I'm happy to say they serve HALF ROLLS, which work perfect for me because I get to taste a little bit of everything rather then getting full to 1 committed roll like other sushi locations. \n\nSeating & Design: Surprisingly this place is actually a pretty good looking place to have a date or impress a co-worker. The seating is okay most tables are at a decent distance from each other unless you got a 2 person table, which is exactly what I seated in. The 2 person table was kind of small, not enough room for my orders.

The snow crab. Last time I was here, they used real crab meat but today they threw on super thinly shredded crab meat mixed with fish flakes/flavoring. I really wish they were honest and just told me that they were out of the snow crab and deterred me from ordering this blasphemous dish. Thus I detracted 1 star for today's snow crab nigiri debacle. \n\nDue to that disappointment, I had 2 desserts to make up for it. The Lychee Sorbet and Green Tea Cake with Sesame Cracker. The sorbet was refreshing, little icy but mainly creamy, and sweet. I'm definitely a fan. As for the cake, I really liked the strong matcha green tea flavor.

Let's face it.... the fish is just better and fresher in Cali or on the east coast..... \n\nHOWEVER, and here comes a HUGE 'however', one thing I can say for sure is that Goyemon is by far the best sushi place in all of Las Vegas. I've tried the places up and down Las Vegas Blvd., the local spots in the Chinatown area, and I've even tried several places that non-Asians say are so amazing in Henderson.... GOYEMON IS THE NUMBER ONE SUSHI HOUSE, trust me on this. Well don't trust only me, trust the other 256 reviews that say something similar ;). \n\nI wouldn't go with any other option than their generous all-you-can-eat specials, $27 per person for dinner, and this includes almost everything your sushi-loving heart desires. All sushi, specialty rolls, appetizers, salads, items from the daily specials board, samplings from the grill, vegetables, dessert, etc., etc., etc.!! The variety they offer is unbeatable, and the quality of the food is fantastic for the buck. \n\nWe've already been here a few times and we can NOT go without the salmon and unagi sushi, some shumai, the 9-1-1 roll (beware! it's hot even for a spice freak like me!), grilled calamari, pork belly, yellowtail from the grill, cajun salmon, grilled asparagus and mushrooms, garlic tuna sushi, and much more on top of that. I can honestly say their samplings of the pork belly may be some of the best I've ever had. Same goes for their mushrooms and grilled calamari. \n\n$4.95 COCKTAILS!! I enjoy my AYCE meal with a SAKETINI for just under $5. Not common to be having a martini of all gin and sake for that low of a price! \n\nmmMmmmMMMmm desserts. Just when you think you've had enough, don't leave without trying the green tea cake and the green tea creme brulee. They are simply fantastic. \n\nThe service is hit or miss. It's always at least decent, but sometimes it can be great because the server is willing to work with you and be more attentive to your needs. For example, last night, our server was friendly, informative, and lenient (he was not trying to force-feed our last 2 pieces of food because of the 'rules' of all-you-can-eat, though we did end up finishing them anyway), and although we were there for the last hour, he was patient and took our orders over and over again without hesitation. Even the food runner was able to take a few orders here and there. We never felt for a second that we waited too long, were being rushed, or that they were casually stalling (some AYCE sushi places definitely stall when approaching your table for reordering). \n\n*** Expect to wait! I would avoid going during peak business hours. Go for early or late dinner, or even late-night because they are open until 3am and last order for AYCE is at 2am everyday! This place is quite the commodity and people will be waiting 1+ hour(s) to be seated whether you go on a weekday or weekend.\n\nDon't forget to receive your special card that they stamp for every AYCE meal so you can eventually enjoy it all over again for FREE!

I know how hard it is to get a 4.5 star rating on Yelp so I was expecting much, much more from this place. I am (or was, it's been a while since I've been) a fan of Sushimon and with all the hype, I've been wanting to try this place for WAY too long. Had to work late for Valentine's Day so what better day than to try it with my gf for a midnight dinner.\n\nOrdered the Orgasm as we sat down since it's my favorite Vegas sushi invention. And the gf wanted a cocktail. Nothing looked good on the drink menu so I ordered her the vodka midori martini. Maybe I messed it up by asking for less vodka, more midori, but the drink was a zero star. It tasted like medicine.\n\nWanted to do the AYCE, but found out that the things we wanted to eat wasn't included so we ordered a la carte.\n\nThe 1) Orgasm came and it was more like the Tease. Yes, the tuna was definitely some of the freshest! But the taste was just not balanced (too much citrus).  We then ordered a few other items:\n\n2) Dynamite - Had to return because it was burnt\n3) Beef Tataki - I like it fine (nice and rare) but gf thought it too salty, which I made the mistake of saving a portion for later and soaking in the ponzu soy sauce, it became too salty for me too\n4) Spicy Tuna Crispy Rice Cracker - probably our favorite dish, unique!\n5) Yum Yum Scallop Handroll - the mix was too dry and the taste bland\n6) Nabeyaki Udon - so-so as the sweet mushrooms overtook all other flavors and made the broth a sweet, salty mess\n7) Got tempted by other Yelpers' Yelp on the pork belly so I ordered it last minute, and wish I hadn't. The flavor was there but the pork belly was undercooked and served room temperature making the fatty part gelatinous.\n\nStill hungry but decided to quit at that. The taste discerning will note that the flavors served here are primarily SWEET eel sauce on everything or the yuzu, mango salsa on everything else. \n\nPerhaps I may make it back here someday but I would only do so if in the mood for AYCE.

I came here in a group of five for a late night sushi run. While 30 minutes is a pretty long wait, we were hungry and there weren't many other options that would be open so late so we stuck it out. Three people in our group got AYCE and two of us got the regular option (I like to take my leftovers home and don't mind the extra expense in doing so). Between the five of us, there were a lot of appetizers, sushi, rolls, and dessert. I myself had the crunchy spicy tuna thing (I never know what it's really called, I just know that it's delicious), the shrimp tempura roll, and a scallop yum roll. They were all great and tasted especially fresh. I really wanted to try the wonton chips but they were sold out which I take as a good sign (next time). I'm not a fan of green tea anything (I'm Chinese... I know, it's sacrilege) but the green tea creme brulee I ordered was devoured in minutes (by me). Yum. We all left, full and happy and I have permanently saved this as my go-to late night (or possibly any time of day if I'm in that area) sushi place.", 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2012-02-21', 'type': 'review'}

I love how their nigiri sushi is fresh and isn't overloaded with white rice.  The nigiri here has the perfect distribution of rice and raw fish.  They have your normal rolls here but nothing that really stands out in flavor. But I like to order my favorite rolls and they are good here: Rainbow, Spider, and Stacey Roll.  They are the perfect size, fresh, and yummy.  They have all your normal sides as well, but the one that is special and unique here is the pork belly.  It's fatty but tasty and a pretty good portion.  Their baked mussels are a little over cooked here, but I like it a little burnt.  My friends did not appreciate it though.  They also have a better variety of desserts than other AYCE sushi places I have been to and they are also AYCE and you aren't just limited to one so that is definitely a plus.\n\nThis place has a super long wait if you come at prime times.

Its very heavy.  Most items on the menu can come in half orders.  Only two complaints.  The decor is beautiful but I hated the layout of the restaurant. Not romantic.  The tables were all almost next to each other almost deli style.  No booths or anything to give any sort of intimacy.  I ordered the spicy tuna on crispy rice and, to my relief, never got it because I was so full.  But it showed up on the bill.

I expected a wait but was disappointed that the estimate was so far off. Oh, well. We were seated at the bar which turned out to be amazing. I finally got to try uni (yum)! The sushi chefs were all extremely helpful and funny. They were super quick to make suggestions without being pushy. I think sitting at the bar helped for faster "refills". We had several half rolls which were all delicious! We tried the pork belly and LOVED it...we had at least 4 orders. The freshness of all the sushi was outstanding.

But what makes these guys different than every other place I've tried in town is the grilled fish menu on the AYCE.  \n\nThese little bites of grilled fishes are some of the best food I have ever had.  It is just as fresh as their nigiri, but marinated and sauced up, and a nice cooked flavor.  Definitely try the pork belly and the cajun salmon....but even the grilled tofu is good, and I don't usually like tofu.\n\nService is hit or miss...sometimes they are really busy, and you will receive orders over 20min later, so make sure you remember what you ordered during each round...they don't really forget, just takes a while to the table on certain days.

We pulled up on a Saturday night at exactly 6pm. I was like, "No cars, shouldn\'t be packed." I walked inside to find a few people waiting and I proceeded to inform the hostess, two please. She said, "Okay maybe 30-40 minutes." Where in the hell are all those people waiting then? I didn\'t really see them or their cars. In actuality, the wait ended up being about 20 minutes. I did tell her we didn\'t care if it was the bar or a table. Plus, it was only two of us so that probably made things easier. The restaurant itself isn\'t that big to begin with. Also, the tables are small and in close proximity to one another. I could\'ve practically reached over with my chopsticks to ninja that Cajun albacore sushi off the neighbor\'s plate if I wanted to. There were some nice flat screens on the walls, just in time for the NBA All-Star events.\n\nI HIGHLY recommend you arriving early. Don\'t show up during crunch time and expect to be seated immediately. They NO LONGER accept reservations nor do I think they care if you carry a platinum player\'s card from one of the many prestigious casinos on the strip. You may want to ditch the entire posse because rolling deep here will probably mean a substantial wait time unless you come super early. This restaurant closes at 3AM and opens at 11:45AM so you have plenty of time to figure out when is best to stroll in.\n\nOnce seated, you have the option to either do the regular pay for whatever you order or go all out and hit the AYCE: lunch $22, dinner $27. Personally, we were there to make it rain. Here\'s the thing about AYCE especially when it comes to sushi, you must have a strategy. Now, before you all say that you hide the rice (which they repeatedly discourage it here; signs placed everywhere), that is not the only tactic to rely on. First, let me be clear when I say that they do not try to play you by giving a heap of rice. The rice portion for our sushi & rolls was actually quite minimal and I give them props for it. Most AYCE sushi joints as we know will load up with this lovely carb to get us full faster. If you attack all the crazy rolls they have, you will obviously get full fast. Luckily, for you they offer half orders on 80% of their rolls so you are able to try their many numerous rolls. Our first round, we attacked the sushi off the bat. I could\'ve sworn, we ordered up to 8-10 nigiri sushi. Might as well test the quality of the fish.\n\nThe amount of food we ordered was tremendous even though it was just the two of us. Our small table was always cluttered or packed with dishes, either empty or full. Service was quite efficient. They constantly cleared out our plates, refilled our drinks, and the food came out in a timely manner. You have about an hour to do the AYCE I believe. Don\'t worry, it\'s plenty of time. Don\'t feel like you need to order everything in the first blow and gulp everything down. We probably ordered 4 or 5 times total and we still were able to somehow squeeze in desert before the hour ended. Before you kill everything in front of you, bust another order so that they can start making it and it\'ll be in front of you sooner to save time.\n\nAs I said, we ordered way too many different items that I can\'t even recall much in great details. Don\'t forget to check their specialty menu because it may change daily. They supposedly serve some soup noodles starting at 11pm. I guess to draw in the drunkies. \n\nNot everything was a thumbs up but I definitely thought that most of what we ordered was pretty good and fresh. If you love pork, get the pork belly appetizer. You will probably order a few. The spider roll was great but uber heavy and if I would\'ve known, I would\'ve avoided it so I can eat more of other things. Plus it\'s listed under the "Can\'t order  1/2 only" section. Check out the Sexy Girl roll, that was one of the tastier specialty rolls. You will notice that there are many sexual inspired names for these rolls too. The miso soup was a bit bland. You can get the tamago sushi, sweet steamed egg without the rice which was really fresh and baked to perfection. The lychee sorbet and the green tea cr\xe8me brulee was just alright. I wished I ordered the tempura ice cream or the always classy, green tea ice cream too but I was about to explode at that point. There were a number of other stuff we ordered but I\'ll leave the whole "wanting to order everything on their menu" experience for when you go check them out yourselves.\n\nI would like to add though that their seaweed salad was very refreshing. We ordered it 3x!\n\nI don\'t think you will be disappointed if you ate here. It was one of the better AYCE sushi joints I\'ve experienced. You can\'t expect the bomb biggity bay at these type of AYCE sushi places but Sushi House Goyemon does an overall outstanding job in every aspect of the getting the job done. \n\nRemember, I warned you to stay away from this place during peaked.', 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2012-03-05', 'type': 'review'}

I don't understand why in some restaurants the servers walk around like they can't see the customers. This is one of those places. The servers would be standing next to us and not pay attention as we waved them down. 3 stars because of the service. And for some reason, the hostess likes to seat down customers and not give enough menus.\n\nThe all-you-can-eat doesn't seem worth it for $27 at dinner, but seems more worth it for $22 at lunch. I think most people can eat their fill for less than the dinner price.

It was atrocious, revolting excuse for sushi.\n\nWhen I walked in, I had a bad feeling when I saw two latino looking sushi chefs at the tsukeba.  Not that I have anything against non-japanese itamae, but from my fairly vast experience....it\'s not a good sign in general and boy was I right.  \n\nSince I\'m Japanese, I don\'t order any rolls.  I always go with straight nigiri, none of those yum yum sauce, fancy rolls bulshit and here are what\'s wrong with their "sushi".\n\n1)  It was ugly.  Cuts of fish were uneven, too small, and were just very asymmetrical and poorly balanced with rice.  When you have two pieces and they look so different, there is a significant lack in their sense of aesthetics, and more importantly, utter luck of skill.\n\n2)  Sushi rice was horrendous.  To make things worse, there were 2 sushi "chefs" and they seem to be using very inconsistent sushi rice.  One was soft and overly sticky, and the other was dry and hard.  Neither of them had proper vinegar flavor, and was too bland to be called "sushi rice".  They obviously have no idea or skill to make proper sushi rice, which is just as, if not MORE important than the fish that goes on it.  \n\n3)  Utter lack of nigiri skill.  Sushi rice was too hard.  You had to chew it.  That is what happens to amateurs and newbies who do not have the proper skills to maintain shape of nigiri while having enough air within it so that if falls apart in the mouth.\n\n4)  The wasabi issue- I was embarrassed for them.  My first order of nigiris had no wasabi.  So I asked the waitress (non-japanese) that I need to have wasabi in the sushi.  She comes back 2 minutes later that "most people" don\'t want wasabi so the "chefs" cannot put wasabi in the nigiri.  Let me repeat "THE CHEFS CANNOT PUT WASABI IN THE NIGIRI"\n\nLet me make this straight.  In Japan, the sushi chefs will occasionally make UPON REQUEST nigiris WITHOUT wasabi for little children, I mean like kindergarden aged kids. Never do they even consider NOT putting wasabi for adults.  So I tell this non Japanese waitress that I don\'t care what "most people" want.  I want wasabi in the nigiri so that I don\'t have to peel the fish off of rice and have to put it on there, and it is the PROPER way to make a nigiri.  So she goes back and talks with this "chefs" and they finally comply with my "request" to make a proper nigiri WITH wasabi.  \n\nIt\'s very unfortunate that whoever the Japanese sushi chef is there allows these "sushi chefs" to let these joke of a sushi out to customers under their roof.  I asked the waitress if there are any Japanese chefs at lunch time and she says that it depends on their schedule, sometimes yes, sometimes not.  Well if a real chefs can\'t be there to properly supervise these jokers then they might as well close down the restaurant instead of allowing these atrocious nigiri\'s out to the customers who may have the palate and knowledge of what a real sushi should be like.  \n\nThe management should be embarrassed with what went on today.  If people think that this kind of atrocity is sushi, then I am truly saddened.  There are better restaurants with real japanese sushi chefs in this town who serve decent AYCE sushi.

The AYCE is an amazing deal, as it includes the specials on the daily special board, grill items, salads, rolls, nigiri, and all sorts of other things.\n\nSome of the new things I tried included the grilled tofu which was quite tasty and amaebi shrimp head miso soup.  The shrimp were a bit harder to eat since they were not fried, but the flavor of them in the broth was good.  The mackerel was cured wonderfully.\n\nSince we were at the bar, we had a nice view of the crazy action here.  We were taken care of by 4 different sushi chefs, and it took me awhile to even start a conversation with Chef Jun, a real Japanese chef yay!, in front of us.\n\nHowever, the biggest disappointment is the rice.  Sushi is all about the rice.  The volume of this restaurant is huge because of the crowds, and the rice is not acceptable for sushi rice.  First of all, it was HOT.  I am talking just made, no cooling/fanning and hardly any vinegar/seasoning.  HOT rice with ice cold fish tastes bizzaroooo.  It ruined the meal.  I noticed the first time we ate here that the nigiri slices were all out of whack.  Because of the volume, the slices are not cut with precision but with speed.  I watched the chefs cut awkward nigiri slices that barely covered the hot rice.  \n\nEric R. asked Chef Jun about the rice.  He said they have such a demand that they just use hot rice, and he apologized because he knows it is just like sushi faux pas 101...most sushi restaurants I have been to make rice in advance.  As someone who learned how to make the rice from a local Japanese market recently, I know that it requires 45 minutes to an hour of fanning and cooling prior to serving, and that is for my small batches (3 cups at a time).

That, to me, is what makes Goyemon stand out above the competition.  We're not just talking miso soup or mochi ice cream either!  Delicious pork belly, yummy grilled veggies, daily sushi specials, green tea cake, black sesame creme brulee...these are some unique offerings.\n\nSushi here is good, and the daily specials always offer a good variety of fish to try.  All of my visits start out with me ordering one of every special, both sushi and grilled items.  The one thing that I haven't really been fond of is the rice.  I know that they get very busy, but it seems like their sushi rice is almost fresh from the rice cooker; by time the sushi gets to the table, the rice is warm and the fish feels like it's been sitting at room temperature for a while.  It's never been bad enough to ruin a meal, but it is something I notice each visit.  To be fair, other people I've dined with either don't notice it or it isn't a big deal, so it could be a personal thing.\n\nOutside of my little rice quirk, Goyemon is a solid choice for sushi.  It has a big roll selection for your casual sushi friends, as well as a good fish selection for you nigiri folk.

We enjoyed having Freds make us surprise rolls as we devoured nigiri, and he was a GREAT conversationalist. I have yet to experience the same type of friendly customer service from the other chefs that work during the lunch hour. \n\nMore importantly is the waitress service. The first time they forgot our edemame it wasn't a huge deal because, like I said in my original review, that's just more room for more fish. But this last time, I actually DID want to munch on some edemame as we waited for our food. What reasonable excuse is there for it to take over 20 minutes to get some damn edemame at a sushi joint? None. \n\nDrinks were slow to get refilled, plates were slow to be bussed. I understand that the space behind the sushi bar is limited and so it's difficult to have more then 2 sushi chefs working, which can sometimes result in the sushi coming out slow. The management at Goyemon really needs to either hire more wait staff, or better train the ones they do have, because a great sushi eating experience should not be soured by slow and inefficient waitresses. \n\nGoyemon, I still like you but if you keep this up, I am going to have to find a new spot to fill my urges for raw fish. :(", 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2012-05-03', 'type': 'review'}

First time back in seven months and I loved it!\n\nI was struggling to hammer down a time and date for dinner here after missing out last week (due to a 2 hour wait in the late evening). Thankfully, one of our friends invited us here out of the blue. Of course, I could not refuse. We picked up enough people for a party of 10 (ended up being just 9) and got seated much more quickly than expected.\n\nAfter sitting down in the side room, I immediately took to sampling the specials menu, and oh man I loved the grilled super white and the grilled cajun salmon. The cajun salmon might not be to everyone's taste, but I really liked how the light sweet sauce (same one as on the pork belly?) balanced out the cajun flavor and how the salmon was cooked just right. But the super white was out of this world tender and flavorful. You simply must try that.\n\nI must pause to mention that the food came out pretty fast, and we generally found ordering not to be a hassle, except for the hiccup of having waiters switched on us. The special nigiri were pretty good, but they weren't that distinctive except maybe the conch.  The standard nigiri were all great, as expected, as were the appetizers and desserts. I also really liked the sashimi salad even though the sashimi pieces were small and the helping of crab modest, but it's still nice. With all the special items, I barely had time for rolls, but I did try one piece of someone's magma roll. it was pretty good but not my favorite due to spiciness.\n\nThe best part of the night was easily enjoying five orders of pork belly (2 pieces each), and the next best part was having about six orders (six pieces) of cajun salmon (because people were full or just didn't feel like it). In my book, Goyemon has the edge over Sushi Mon mainly because of that pork belly. I could have easily eaten that fat-filled, sweet sauce-covered goodness all night. Thus, this is still the Vegas-area sushi place that I'd recommend for dinner over all others.", 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2012-05-04', 'type': 'review'}

There is definitely a large selection of sushi that you can order and other food items that you can order.  I would suggest trying to come a little bit earlier since it can get very crowded and the wait tends to be fairly long. You can put your name down and come back (or they will call you when your next on the list). They do have a time limit on the AYCE (one hour) to limit the time that you sit and increase the turnover of patrons.\n\nSome of the better sushi pieces - yellowtail, salmon, super white tuna, albacore, and halibut. You can also get uni and sweet shrimp in the AYCE but it is also limited to one order (two pieces) per person. \n\nI'm also a fan of some of their appetizers - poke, seaweed salad, pork belly, and baked green mussels. \n\nOverall, we have started to come here for AYCE more often as long as we don't have to wait more than 30 minutes (which on occasion does occur). It is a place to come when you have a big appetite and want to eat and eat and eat. And don't forget the AYCE dessert - green tea and red bean ice cream are definitely something to get too.", 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2012-06-07', 'type': 'review'}

I also would mind it being a little different seasoning wise.  Also I might have been spoiled by the last AYCE place I\'ve been to which offered golden crispy prawns. \n\n- They must have uni, which they had, nothing bad about it.  I loved the uni.  It was fresh looking and very tasty and come with a quail\'s egg different but perfect. I must have more of this next time.\n\n- They must have poke, which they had in tako or ahi, tasty but it was just OK.  It was more of a salad as there were a lot more seaweed and other ingredients then tako or ahi.  Little too.\n\n- Specialty rolls and dishes.  They have the pork belly which is tasty but I would\'ve liked it with more meat or just cooked longer, firmer and crunchier too.  For special rolls I\'ve tried the pixie roll and sexy girl roll, really liked them both. I\'ll try to do more specialty rolls next time since I only tried 2 and since I\'m thinking I\'m going to love those rolls the better. \n\n- They must have oysters, preferably grilled but I\'ll do battered and fried which is what they had. It was good or OK but still loved to have the grilled ones. \n\nBased on my list it was just OK for me a 3.\n\nAway from my list, they have conch nigiri which seemed cool but I found it not so good since it the first time having conch, it rubbery and tasteless.  They have baked green mussels which I liked. They have AYCE desserts which I loved, most places only offer 1 dessert with AYCE. Here I had the lychee sorbet, green tea creme brulee, and mango mousse shot. They were out of the tempera ice cream which was a bummer since that was the only dessert I really wanted.\n\nFor service they did an excellent job.  It was a UYE and we did not have to wait for a table to be setup, only for the yelps to show up.  We had half of the VIP room, shared with some other loud party but it was all good since they left half way through our dinner. We stayed 3 hours and was not bothered "Hey you gotta leave". They also were cool with separating the checks for each of us.\n\nGoyemon is very good.  They have items that stood out like the pork belly and the uni with quail egg nigiri but there were also some misses.  It was also my first time here so I will have to give them a 3.5 or 4 for now with the possibility of improving after my next visit, hopefully again with my yelp posse or if that doesn\'t happen I\'ll just have to try everything on the menu.', 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2012-06-10', 'type': 'review'}

Soy sauce normally contains wheat. We asked if they could leave it off, but the server said the sushi chefs prepare them in a batch with other people\'s orders and thus could not (or rather, would not) prepare it without the ponzu.

I'm a hungry guy, when I'm in an atmosphere such as AYCE, I'm there to be in for the kill. \n\nRight after the Volcano Roll, I asked for the ecstasy and philadelphia roll. Note, everything I order is half rolls, not full. I like diversity over quantity. This time, it took somewhere from 10-15 minutes..... COME ON. These chefs are professional and I understand that they can be under duress but I'm SURE that this joint has been under far more pressure ever than by one single person with that being just me. How can it take nearly 40 minutes to make 3 half rolls???? I can run to the strip and back in that time. (Ok not really). Then I just ordered the sunrise and sexy girl rolls and after that, I was way too frustrated with the incompetency of the services so concluded with my mochi and green tea ice cream. And no, it's not because of the chefs. The table next to me which had one less person ordered rolls later than me and received them before me. Not to mention, they are FULL rolls. NOT HALF. If anyone can PLEASE give me a logical explanation for the terrible service, I will be happy to give you my stamp card which is at 10, making my next visit free. \n\nYet, for a tab at $70, my friends and I ended up paying $10 for service. Obviously they feel the need to tip just because they feel bad. But I don't feel bad. Feeling bad is for all the hungry kids around the world. Their terrible service may be explained that they like to stall me so that my stomach can process foods faster and make me full quicker. But that's why I'm here because I'm going to fight it if I have to. They may have done this so that my stomach can process the foods faster and to make me full quicker. Nevertheless, a business tactic that I don't appreciate because they don't appreciate my business. \n\nMake no mistake, this review is subject to change because I do hope that they can make up for their stupidity. The food quality is the cream of the crop. But if they choose to fail me next time in serving me, I will pay the price and no tip. Then I'll never return, only to keep my commitment to Goyemon's sibling, Mon.", 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2012-07-30', 'type': 'review'}

IT MUST HAVE! It's hard to imagine why on a Friday night such a highly acclaimed venue would have any bad nights, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. I'm down for a second shot at this place, but my first overall experience was very, very mediocre.\n\nThe rice to fish ratio was just ugh...bad. No bueno. Yelling mercy. By the fourth sushi, there was nothing I could taste except for rice. The rice itself is so thin, almost like jasmine rice. What is this, Chinese food?? If the rice was at least a bit fuller in texture I wouldn't complain. I can also tell the rice is packed differently. It sits there like a small clump, and its hard to break down when you're chewing it. It's very laborious and completely takes away the experience from the fish. No, I don't hide my rice. I eat them as a whole with the fish. Last night I really wish I didn't. Now that I think about it, I think I did leave a few rice clumps here and there under the dish. Hmm, I never had this problem at Xtreme Sushi...\n\nThe service was nothing exceptional. Our waitress barely made any eye contact with our table and was slow to take our orders. It wasn't too bad, but I expected at least to be on par with other venues. I mean, the place was not even full and the waitress was hard to find like a rare pokemon (Pikachu in Viridian Forest, anyone?). I never had this issue at Xtreme Sushi...\n\nThe fish is OK. I have to say the yellowtail is my favorite. I'm so glad the yellowtail did not disappoint. The shrimp on the other hand, was not that good. Everything else was mediocre. I decide to give it one last shot and order uni (sea urchin). I really like to gauge the quality of the restaurant by eating sea urchin. Sea urchin spoils quicker than other fish, so it's really easy to spot bad sea urchin by the dull color and the foul smell. Would Goyemon pass the sea urchin fish test? Hmm...The anticipation. Man it's killing me. I wave down a waitress and put in the order...GULP!\n\nWell I wouldn't know until next time because they were out. What?!? Are you kidding me...Although Xtreme Sushi has a limit of 1 order per person, I would rather eat ONE uni than none at all.\n\nSo that pretty much sums up my whole night. Will my return at Goyemon be a better experience? Movie sequels are rarely ever better than the first one, unless Goyemon is like the Terminator; mediocre first, EPIC the second.

Seen this in California since the early 90\'s.  It seems to be part of the Las Vegas landscape.  I guess it is buffet mentality, most bang for the buck.  You would not think eating sushi in NY, LA or Tokyo would be a world of difference but it is.  \n\nI would say that in my opinion of all the AYCE sushi Vegas, Goyemon is the best I\'ve seen.  I was more impressed when they first opened.  They have since increased their hours and business ten fold.  Quality is hit or miss.  Probably would not recommend Sundays, that\'s when anything raw becomes questionable.  One of the key differences is the variety of product and the fact that they do use fresh tuna.  Everyone else is still stuck on frozen blocks.  Which btw is pretty disgusting.  I think I mentioned this before, but anything bright unnaturally pink or red is frozen.  Maybe you don\'t care what you eat.  A friend of mine recently said "you paid $70 for sushi?  You got ripped off,  I usually only pay $25 for AYCE".  Patted her on the head smiled and said yes you get what you pay for.  \n\nImagine this, of all the fresh tuna sold on the world markets, some doesn\'t get sold.  Just like the last bunch of produce sitting there in the grocery store.  Some of this tuna can become 3 weeks old.  It is poorly handled then poorly stored.  After this some company in Vietnam or Korea buys 10,000 pounds of this old tuna that nobody else wants for a rock bottom deal.  This tuna is already starting to rot and turn grayish brown on the outside.   But thanks to modern technology, these overseas companies invest in machine and equipment that will treat the fish with coloring and preservative.  All of a sudden it\'s red again, not really natural red, but good enough.  Then it is frozen, packed and shipped to the US.  Funny enough, these countries ban the sale and use at home, but the North American client is big business.  That is the tuna you eat in most AYCE sushi bars.  Enjoy!\n\nBack to Goyemon who also owns Sushi Mon.  But for some reason the quality is different.   Don\'t order ala carte, they don\'t want that either, that\'s why the same shit is still served.  Technique on sushi pretty good.  \n\nTuna  - usually really good.  last time they were using a cut of the tuna that most people would scrape or discard.  could tell by the weird taste and texture.  1 star.  \n\nHamachi - always decent, but all hamachi unless wild comes the same farm raised fresh, frozen, treated with preservatives or all natural\n\nSalmon - decent as well, though not a big fan of Atlantic salmon.  the only really healthy salmon is possibly Scottish or wild.  Seared salmon is good and gives a nice textural contrast. \nhttp://www.albany.edu/ihe/salmonstudy/pressrelease.html\n\nHirame - always good\n\nPork Belly App - nice to see something different, tasty but the mango salsa needs some work\n\nKatsuo - decent, but they use frozen\n\nAmaebi - actually not bad; only one per person\n\nUni - only one order per person.  seemed like a lower grade or frozen?  never had this before, taste is ok, but there is a weird uniform color and texture\n\nUnagi - same always good\n\nSushi rice - usually good, though the last time was kinda dry and seemed old like it was sitting around all day\n\nTempura - yuck don\'t get this, might be better in a roll or something\n\nTamago -  good, thanks for making it and not buying frozen\n\nSuper White Toro - bleah\n\nRed Snapper - actually frozen tilapia\n\nGyoza - same pre-packaged frozen crap\n\nGreen Mussels - yes frozen NZ Green Lip Mussels, super cheap and baked with eel sauce and mayonnaise\n\nRolls - all good, lots of rice, you will be full after about 4 of these then so much for AYCE\n\nService - Good and attentive\n\nAll in all worth making a trip every few months to get your sushi fix.

So in my search of the BEST one, I think I'm going to have to go with Sushi House Goyemon. \n\nLunch is 21.95 and dinner is 24.95. I asked what the difference is and it's just a small change-up of the menu with the addition of some extra sushi pieces. Lunch would satisfy me just fine any day.  However, if you want to try that green tea creme brule and that nice green cake in the main photo... you'll have to join them for dinner (Reminder: come back for dinner soon). \n\nThe place is small and they don't take reservations. I'd say there were about a good 10-12 tables in the main dining area, and an extra 3-4 tables in their extra room in the back. So if you're planning to throw a big birthday hoopla there, make sure you and your guests come early to reserve because they won't sit you unless you are all present. The decor is simplistic but modern with their wooded ceiling framework and their fancy light structures (i think it came from Ikea).\n\nNow finally on to the food. The appetizers aren't bad. The nigiri sushi pieces are mediocre. Too little rice, and not enough fish. If you're a salmon lover, skip the nigiri and just get a salmon handroll. It's much more worth it, I promise. If you have some rice left over on the place, order the dynamite (creamy mixture of seafood and mayo concoction) and pair it with the rice, it's actually pretty darn good and compliments each other very well! I'm not the biggest roll fan but I actually enjoy their rolls here. I love how they provide the option of getting half orders (4 pieces) of each roll so you don't have to kill yourself to finish massive amount of pieces to avoid any extra charges of anything left over. \n\nThere's some good and bad traits, but overall I think you'll get the most bang out of your AYCE buck here.", 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2012-09-15', 'type': 'review'}

What a steal! The whole time we were there my friend and I only ordered nigiri! haha We really wanted to make sure we got our money\'s worth! It was to the point our server said, "You know, we offer other items like specialty rolls and side dishes!" :P After each bite of nigiri, my appreciation for raw fish greatly increased. :) All the nigiri we had ordered was very fresh and delicious! It was my first time trying other fishes besides salmon... fishes I hadn\'t even heard of. Tai? Hamachi? Hotate? Saba? Hirame? Unfortunately, we couldn\'t order the amaebi (sweet shrimp) or uni (sea urchin) because it wasn\'t dinner time yet :( Boooo... next time though!\n\nCan you believe we still had room for dessert? Yes, I got 2 scoops of green tea ice cream and a scoop of lychee sorbet. All were excellent! I was a bit embarrassed to order the tempura ice cream since we\'d ordered so much nigiri already and our server put our check down at the table, which was probably a sign for us to leave! haha I guess the next time I come back I\'ll need to order a few tempura ice creams first! :D', 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2012-10-10', 'type': 'review'}

Until the current manager changes the way he handles complaints, I give this place only five more years.\n\nThe restaurant was maybe 3/4ths full, so I was expecting faster service than the times I have been here when it was jam-packed full with a line out the door. Continuing, I looked over the menu (it has been redesigned), and I saw that the same favorites were in place: Braised pork belly, super white tuna, and cajun albacore. I started off the night with an order each of amaebi and uni for me and my boyfriend, and we also ordered two half rolls to start. The both of us chatted as we awaited our food, and the natto roll, amaebi, and the uni came out. I was pleased with the sweetness of amaebi and the freshness of the uni. "So, I take it that the Calico roll is still on its way?" After an affirmative, we placed a few more nigiri orders. For your reference, the Calico roll is not a deep fried roll: Just a few slices of fish in the middle and slices on top. Not a very time-intensive roll at all, so we were sure it will show up soon.\n\nBy the time we finished with our sushi, we continued to wait for the rest of our orders.  About ten to fifteen minutes pass, and it seems that the sushi still has not shown up, so we decided to order some braised pork belly and miso soup. That order came fast (within maybe five minutes), and we were glad to note that the portions were larger. However, one bite in, and the insides of the belly were frozen. Maybe there are some people that like their fatty meats cold, but I personally prefer it to be warm and melty. We brought this up, and after an apology they took this to the back. As a customer, you can see the sushi chefs working on their sushi, and you can see the grillmaster who does the grilled entrees and desserts. The waiter (we later learn he\'s the manager) and the grillmaster exchanged a few words, kept sneaking glares towards our table, and rather than getting right to cooking it, they stood there and chatted for a better part of a couple minutes. It didn\'t look like they wanted to fix the problem.\n\nAs this is going on, my boyfriend mentions that service seems to be slower than usual, and I cannot help but agree. I did point out to him, though, that if he would just sit at the sushi bar for once, we can get fish faster in general. Five minutes later, new pork belly arrived to the table. Blackened and charred on both sides. Well, this time they definitely made sure that it was warm on the inside. We scraped off the black charcoal and ate the belly. \n\nWe inquire about the status of the rest of our order. Our waitress replied, "Oh, you haven\'t received it yet?" "No, we have not received it yet." She apologizes, we say it is fine, and we place a few more orders for their specials for the night, namely salmon pork belly nigiri. The rest of the orders filter in, including the salmon pork belly, but we had to reorder the orgasm sauce, the miso soup, and a few other nigiri because they lost the order. I contemplated over the service as I was savoring the fatty salmon belly. The rest of the orders showed around fifty minutes after we sat down.\n\nMy significant other declares that he\'s done, so I decide to follow suit. I note that in the course of the extended delays and mistakes, our table time has already reached the hour. They lost our orders for desserts, and I couldn\'t seem to reach anyone for a response. I note that the moment I place down my credit card, someone zips by quickly to pick it up. I asked for a comment card, but not having one, I wanted to speak to a manager about our experience.\n\nShe went to go see the manager, and I recognized him for helping out on the floor. He turns his back to chat with someone else for a while saw him shake his head, and decides to head over with our missing dessert orders. I thank him for bringing the dessert, though I brought up my main points, namely how service is slower than usual, and how our orders were messed up. He says a brisk "My apologies", and then he explains someone was out for the day and servers switched. I understood the first part. Yet, it was the same person who took our order from start to finish, so I asked if he was sure that was the reason why. To this, he retorts,  "You see the people waiting outside at the door? Yeah, you can\'t expect everyone in here just to serve you."\n\nSerious misunderstanding on his part, and he left me to fume silently. I do not like to go to places where I don\'t feel welcome, and while I won\'t judge a place based on the behavior of one worker, I will judge it based on the behavior of a manager. A place that can\'t take fair input graciously will only deteriorate over time.\n\nI hope that when I return two years from now the management has changed. There ARE better AYCE in town, for cheaper, just as fresh, and faster.

With the nearly full house crowd close to 10pm at night, I figured it can\'t be THAT BAD!\n\n\nTo my surprise it was quite good!\n\nOk not sushi sho good in Berkeley, but the fish was very fresh and they had a great selection, including the "black board" specials. The black board specials has the more exotic cuts of fish, toro, black caviar roe, kama, and a bunch that evades my brain at the moment, but something that you would pay $8-9 for nigiri for at any bay area sushi place. Black board specials are the way to go! IT also changes as the night progresses, sometimes they run out of stuff\'; only to be replaced by other things.\n\nAYCE is basically off a menu, and you order whatever you want.\n\nThere\'s a great selection of hot foods and salads, along with tons of nigiri and rolls.\nI don\'t do JIVE ass rolls like Nobu K, so I went for all nigiri.\n\nThere is a uni limit of 2 pieces per person but that didnt bother me as there were plenty of other great fishes including toro, and all your standard nigiri cuts of fish.\n\nYes the fish was cut a bit uneven and some of the rice fell apart before it made it to my mouth. but for $25 you cant beat it!\n\nEverything from the cucumber salad to fried tempura shrimp to the black board special cuts of fish were delicious including the desserts. \n\nWe sat at the sushi counter and were served by the sushi chef, whom were all mexican for the exception of one -japo chef who seemed to  be the head chef.\n\nGood service by the servers and the counter chefs. \n\nI was very surprised at the quality of each item we ate and wish we had one of these in the bay area!

Something make sure take look at when deciding so don't miss anything. \n\nI always start with nigiri. Always been my favorite although I still naturally get my speciality rolls in but am old school fish and rice. I always felt that nigiri one of the best judges of  the quality of the fish. I was impressed for sure the quality of all the fish they have is excellent! The speciality rolls tried the 9-1-1 roll had nice little kick too it and the Ecstasy roll looked good tasted alright but next time try another one. The poki was solid. It usually miss comes too poki at AYCE not all place have them. Still have too give the edge 808 poki style is more local style that I love and use too. The thing that stand out about the poki here is they use some fresh seaweed along with nicely thin shaved white onion, and nice poki sauce. Tried the grilled prok belly with mango salsa. Tasty!! The pork belly perfect hard grill sear on the outside and little of mango salsa top of it. It like pork butter goes down smooth. Majority of it nigiri not go wrong with any one I pounded the hamachi, albacore, and salmon. Loving it!\n\nI sat at the sushi bar. The sushi bar really like the set up! It had lots of room for your sushi. Unlike tradition ones little further back say from the glass and see all the fish there using for the night. You have added shelf on top stack empty plates if pounding away like that extra space (minus is reach further over too get the sushi)! =) They have nice widescreen tv behind the bar. It monday night football so any major sporting event perfect spot for sushi and sports. It not like most place tv far away right in front of you. \n\nThe service was awesome.

We usually come in every month but this time we will never return. \n  Normally, when your eating in a sushi place, the first thing everyone notice is the food, service, and waiting time. \n\nThe food was horrible. I come to a sushi place to eat fish not rice. I only ate the nigiri because there wasn't much good selections on rolls. The nigiri was a disappointment. All the fish had humongous rice and the fish was not pressed down properly. Once you see the rice portion is bigger than the fish than that is an insult. \n \nSo we complained about it to our server. He said he'll talk to the manager. The server came back and said I'm sorry we CAN'T do anything about it. The manager didn't have the balls to stop by our table and talk to us. The manager has seen us a few times and he knows we tip 30% or more. Back then, the manager usually greet us and takes our table. Last time he offered comp bottle of sake but this time he acted like he barely knew us. Anyhow, we ordered a few more to see if they would fix the problem but instead the rice gets bigger every time and the cut of fish just gets smaller. We are not asking for them to put extremely less rice but balance out the portion of the fish to the rice.  Over all the server/manager sucks. Poor customer service.  \n\nWaiting time was great. There was no line, finally. Usually, goyemon is always packed and i would wait 30 mins to an hour to be seated. Thats how much I use to love goyemon. It use to be worth the wait.   \n  Food came out on time as expected. But our server was always missing. Server just clears out our table and runs away. We always have to wait or ask the attentive host to call our server.

Anyway, it\'s not about the rule i\'m complaining about but her god damn attitude and tone of voice. even the surrounding tables talked about her crappy attitude so i know we weren\'t thinking this in our heads...\n\nthen because of AYCE rule and the one hour limit, we decided to just order off the menu.we got the sush dinner for two, one fancy smancy role and an appetizer.  somewhere along the way, another meal got added to our table. when we questioned it, she said someone ordered a combo first time around then when she came back to take the rest of our orders, she assumed we still wanted the first order. assumed?!!? if you weren\'t sure, why didn\'t you ask? she was so unapologetic about it and basically said "even if you don\'t eat it, you\'re still getting charge for it." \n\nruined our experience. definitely won\'t be back.', 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2012-12-04', 'type': 'review'}

I've been meaning to try AYCE at this place ever since it opened and finally got the chance.

I also got three helpings of the cucumber side order and one order of octopus poki (yum!) to go with the AYCE. Everything else was pretty standard but all fresh.\n\nThere's a chalkboard with special menu items, which included very delicious kobe beef nigiri, the desserts, and sake (the only special not included in the AYCE price).\n\nThis was the first time I have ever saved room for dessert at AYCE sushi and it was well worth it! The red bean ice cream and green tea brulee were pretty darn good.\n\nThe hostess and bussers were very attentive and friendly while the sushi chefs were not. Maybe it was a bad day/time or something but literally no sushi chef smiled once and when we ordered we were told to slow down (it wasn't even that much). They spent a large portion of the time talking to each other (it didn't even sound like friendly banter!)\n\nThe bathrooms had a nice touch - ice in the sink.

My husband I have been going here for a little over a year now, and have learned a couple of things after a few (we'll leave it at a few) visits.  First thing, come early or be ready to wait.  We usually come on the weekends and if you come during peak hours you could be waiting up to an hour sometimes (still worth the wait BTW).  Second, always do AYCE even if you think you're not that hungry.  The a la carte prices can get pricey and you're probably going to end up at the cost of the AYCE anyways.  Plus, be adventurous.  We love the AYCE here partly because you can try something without fear of not liking it.  Sushi house goyemon offers a loyalty card where you buy 10 AYCE and get the 11th free, so plenty of reason to come back.\n\nThe sushi at Goyemon is fresh and they are very generous.  I mostly stick with the Nigiri and the rolls which you can't go wrong with.  I'd also recommend trying the sashimi salad, rice cracker, and pork belly (mmmm pork belly!).  The desserts are a perfect ending to the meal, especially the mochi and the green tea creme brulee.\n\nThe service is just OK (thus 4 stars instead of 5).  I understand that they are busy on the weekends, but I usually find myself practically having to wave my hands in the air to get attention from our server.  A little more attention would have been much appreciated.\n\nOverall, the food is outstanding while the service could be a bit better.

Where else can you eat your fill of nigiri sushi for about $25 a person?  \n\nWe arrived early, at about 530-545 pm and the restaurant was already full.  With only a short wait, we took two seats at the sushi bar, which proved to be a blessing.  It was so much easier to give our orders directly to the sushi chefs and instantaneously receive our sushi.  At a table, you're at the mercy of the waitresses, who are harder to come by. \n\nDo yourself a favor, don't waste time on the rolls.  Not even one.  I don't care how interesting that fried/eel sauced concoction sounds.  They are huge, heavy and a waste of stomach space. We had the Cynthia roll and a Soft Shell Crab roll of some kind and while you can get 1/2 rolls (4-5 pieces) they are clunky monsters, bigger than the size of your mouth and glopped with mayo and eel sauce. \n\nInstead, focus on the sushi.  There are two-order limits on just two kinds of sushi - the amebi (sweet shrimp) and the uni (sea urchin) so make sure you order those to the max.  The uni was great - fresh and creamy and extremely flavorful.  We also really enjoyed the yellowtail and the salmon belly and liked the halibut, aji, and unagi.  With the amebi, request that the heads be fried, because they come to you in a miso soup, which is a nice contrast to all the cold foods you are eating. \n\nGoyemon isn't just about sushi though.  They have a pretty decent hot foods menu to provide some variety to the meal.  The pork belly was tiny in portion and not super tender.  The grilled vegetables are nicely grilled.  They even have udon and a ramen which is only available if you're there late at night.  \n\nMake sure to save room for dessert.   Though they have things like green tea icecream or fried icecream, they readily admit those things are store-bought.  They take greater pride in their housemade green tea brulee, which has a sweet, subtle, jiggly matcha pudding with a paper thin brulee on top.  Another delicious dessert is the lychee sorbet, which is store-bought, but really aromatic and a nice palate cleanser.  \n\nThis is no Nozawa but the quality was really quite good and for the price, unbeatable.", 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2013-01-04', 'type': 'review'}

No joke.\n\nI\'ve been to so many all-you-can-eat sushi places and tons of Japanese restaurants in my lifetime that I feel confident saying that Goyemon has one of the best sushi\'s in the States.  This would probably be a whole different story if I\'ve been to Japan, but that has yet been crossed off my bucket list.  In the meantime, this place is my #1 spot.\n\nSo why do I love this place?  Although Goyemon currently has 4 stars according to Yelp, I feel that it depicts this place so wrongly.  It should receive 5 1/2 stars. That\'s how great it is.  Being Asian and all, I have come to love rice.  White, brown, sticky, broken...I LOVE rice, just ask the boyfriend.  When it comes to sushi, the way the rice is prepared makes all the difference in the world.  Trust me, I know.  If the rice is too sticky, you\'ll be sitting there all day chewing on sticky rice.  If there\'s too much rice vinegar then the sushi rice just falls apart once chopsticks come in contact with it.  This place does it right.  They "cut" the rice in such a way that it\'s one with the sashimi/raw fish.  The portion between the fish itself as well as the sushi rice is perfect.  Some places either put so much more rice hoping it\'d fill you up faster, but that just takes away all the trust a customer has in the restaurant as well as the sushi chef.  \n\nBomb dynamite.  A lot of sushi places are starting to add rice at the bottom of these delectable appetizers, but it\'s really taking away the taste of this delicious dish.  Goyemon thankfully doesn\'t do that. \n\nMussels.  Can\'t go to a sushi restaurant without getting mussels... \n\nIf they ever provide this option as a part of the all-you-can-eat-deal, then I say get it.  This is the salmon belly.  What\'s great about it is, is that it\'s very much like salmon, it just melts so much more in your mouth.  You\'ve got to try it if you can. \n\n And the one fish I can never cheat on, white tuna.  My absolute favorite. \n\nGenerally at all-you-can-eat places I leave a little room for dessert.  Goyemon\'s lychee sorbet dessert is one of a kind (to me).  It\'s not your regular sorbet, a little bit more on the sticky side as if you were chewing on mochi, but not as chewy as mochi.  That may not make any sense, but in a way it melts nicely in your mouth, sort of like soft, snow that is just falling down. \n\nIf you plan to eat there, make sure to head there early in the day right before they open.  It\'s a little slow at first, but it quickly gets busy 15-30 minutes later.  It\'s so packed, people are just waiting out the door.  What\'s even more interesting is that the location isn\'t even that great.  It\'s a little off the strip (15 minutes away), but I love that about it.  It attracts locals and very few tourists go out there so you aren\'t bombarded by tourists even though you may considered as one. \n\nAlready missin\' you....\n\nLina Chen', 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2013-01-08', 'type': 'review'}

My favorite roll is the hurricane. Always check their daily specials board. Amazing grilled squid, cajun salmon, and unique fresh fishes. The garlic edamame is the way to go.

I tried calling to make reservations, but they don\'t take reservations. I asked how long on average the wait is and they couldn\'t really say and when I asked just give me an approximation, they told me they have a wait every night. All I wanted was an answer of "the wait could be X min to Y hours"...but the hostess on the phone gave me a long run around...alittle annoyed.\n\nUpon arriving, it\'s located in a strip mall about 1.5 miles away from the strip. They have a time limit of 1 hour, which is plenty to get full in one sitting, and have selected pieces, the sweet shrimp and uni, to 1 order (2 pcs per person). After ordering, our food took quite some time to come out, about 25 min or so...seemed to take forever. we didn\'t go overboard with order the 1st round because they said if you have left overs or leave the rice, the restaurant will charge you a la carte price. So 2nd round we went overboard ha....ordered what we really liked from 1st round.

Plus, the service was fantastic, friendly and fast. \n\nThe pork belly appetizer was juicy and yummy...probably our favorite thing.  I would  recommend ordering it off the regular menu because you get 5 large super juicy pieces that for whatever reason were a bit better than the smaller pieces given on the AYCE version that the hub had.

We tried the Pixie roll (wrapped in colored soy paper...festive), the Volcano roll, the Sushi Max (tuna w shrimp), and the Sexy Girl roll, which was our fav and had everything but the kitchen sink, but had the cleanest flavor profile, rather than a mish mash with sauce.\n\nThis is a peeve of mine about sushi rolls everywhere, so it's not a criticism of Goyemon. Rolls are Americanized, sporting lots of stuff that doesn't belong in sushi (cream cheese, yuck) that they all start to taste the same, covered in the same homogenous sauce, or as Goyemon unfortunately called theirs, 'Orgasm Sauce', Please stop calling it that.", 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2013-01-16', 'type': 'review'}

I did a lot of research for a good sushi place before my room mate and I went to Vegas for a week over NYE and we weren't steered wrong by the reviews.

Twice for lunch and once for dinner. Sushi is super expensive where we are from in Bermuda, so we were beyond excited to pay less than $30 for AYCE (we definitely don't have that option at home!). They don't do sashimi but they do pretty well everything else. It is quite a small restaurant and was packed every single time we went, there was also a line waiting. That's when you know it's worth the wait. The last time we went for lunch, we went right when it opened so we didn't have to wait to be seated, but it did not take long before the place was full. I spoke to some guys who were from Vegas who said they eat there all the time. I can't list my favorite roll because there were too many choices, just try everything! I will say the steamed gyoza are incredible, I could have eaten those all day long. They do have a time limit stated on the menu, I think it was 45 mins - 1 hour per person, but I'm pretty sure we were there a longer than that and no one kicked us out. \n\nGo here, it was amazing.

However, the waitress was really good about coming out to check on us often, and refill our waters, etc.\n\nThey have a lunch and dinner AYCE deal, for $21.95 & $26.95.  There are about 50 menu options for each item, ranging from  nigiri, normal rolls, and special baked rolls.  It's really nice because anything on the regular menu you can get in the AYCE option (including the $12-13 specialty rolls).

We came here a few weeks ago and the service left much to be desired. After waiting 30 minutes for a server to take our drink orders at the bar, we finally got our food and it tasted average. Nothing to write home about. \n\nTonight, we got sat after a short wait (8pm), and once again waited 10-15 minutes for a waiter to come greet us. My girlfriend got the beef udon which comes with a California roll. With her being allergic to artificial crab, we asked them to remove the crab. The waitress informed us that this would result in a $2.50 charge. What??? Last time I checked, a what would be a cucumber roll costs less than a California roll, and especially the fact that a guest is allergic dictates that reasonable accommodations be made. Our waitress made a big fuss and finally I told her to grab the manager. She went and grabbed another server, who told us that there were no exceptions and they had to charge us more because they would have to use an extra strip of cucumber in lieu of the crab. Once again, what kind of drugs do you have to be high on to think that it makes sense to charge someone $2.50+$3.75 for a cucumber roll compared to a $4.25 California roll?? \n\nAt this point he told me that this was by order of the chef so I asked to speak to him, and he told me that the chef was too busy and he can't pull him off the floor. Instead, he grabbed a business card and wanted me to email the owner. Last time I checked, when a guest is allergic you don't punish them and certainly don't insult them by refusing to amend the situation and defuse it professionally. Needless to say, we got up and went next door to sushi 21, which although smaller, has much better service. I'm glad that I put in a 15 nigiri order and they were already halfway done when when we left haha.\n\nPs.

Yes, we knew better and still we arrived at 7 PM.  After a wait of about 1.5 hours (I swear, it's worth it to satisfy your AYCE sushi craving) we were seated.  The guys took a picture of the specials board and then simply decided they wanted one of everything (not including dessert).  I perused the on-line menu earlier that day (the anticipation was killing me) and decided I would focus on trying various rolls besides having a few of my favorites.\n\nLet me start by sharing with you that I was especially happy with the AYCE in that you can order 1/2 a roll (four pieces).  Who needs more justification than that?\n\nI started with Sexy Girl:  a harmony of shrimp tempura, crab meat & cucumber with a generous kiss of spicy tuna and scallop yum yum on top, then sprinkled with tempura crumbs, a spicy garlic and spicy eel sauce.  I was very happy with the ratio of fish to rice.  My very scientific measurement is if I can put one whole piece in my mouth.  Too much rice and there is no way I can; just the right amount and it fits like a glove.  Slightly warm and sooo good!   I'll sheepishly admit I ordered a 2nd 1/2 roll as my last item of the evening.\n\nI quickly ordered my favorite nigiri, hamachi (yellow tail).  It was so fresh and delicate and just beautiful.  Mmmm...  I ordered the garlic tuna as well, which I enjoyed but truthfully like the garlic sauce a bit more at some other places.\n\nThe pork belly with mango salsa is a must have when we go - it never disappoints!  Succulent and juicy on the inside, charred on the outside pairs perfectly with the sweet mango salsa.\n\nTime for a palate cleanser!  No Name roll was perfect - Spicy tuna and asparagus that still has a nice bit are blanketed by the delicate flavors of yellow tail.  This roll is served cold and is bland compared to others.  The fish sing in this composition, and it was really quite refreshing.\n\nMy husband and I shared a bowl of octopus poki (good, just not one of my favorites) and I snagged a piece of his unagi (eel) as well as a piece of someone's Red Dragon (spicy tuna, cucumber, & avocado with eel and eel sauce on top).\n\nI really wanted to try dessert, I really did.  But I couldn't.  My belly was very happy and very full.", 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2013-02-24', 'type': 'review'}

After having tried another place, that place came pretty close, but to this day, Goyemon still holds the spot for #1 sushi place.\n\nSuper white tuna=like butter in my mouth. I can finish 10 orders of this and still not be full. Gotta try the dynamite, it\'s the best in town. More staples are shrimp tempura, calamari, baked green mussels. For nigiri, other than super white tuna, yellowtail, garlic tuna, salmon, sweet shrimp, unagi, and cajun albacore. The gf likes rolls, and always gets the Japanese Lasagna and the OID. I like the pastel myself. I don\'t like rolls that much anymore. They make me full a lot quicker and I want to make my AYCE experience worth it every time. I honestly haven\'t had a roll here that I didn\'t like. Dessert: You gotta save some room for some green tea creme brulee. Sometimes, they have vanilla creme brulee and chocolate mousse too and I just go all out and order that trio. Now this is the only sushi place in town I know of that has this high a caliber in desserts, and that my friends, is the second reason why it is my fave sushi joint.

We were very disappointed in the organization of "first come first serve" which is not entirely true considering one guest came in and said they had a reservation and the wait was half the time for a table. I was there 15 mins before the rest of my group and although there was an open table I was told I had to wait for everyone to get there. Even when everyone did arrive, we still waited to be seat though our table was sitting open in front of us. The hostess said she didn\'t want to overwhelm the kitchen but I thought still you could seat is and have the waitress take our drink order? We finally were seated after 10 mins. I have never be forced to stand in the way of the door with my table open right in front of me for 25 mins. The food was great but service was not. We were all worried about getting our order in before the hour window of eating because our waitress barely came to our table. At the end of the meal, we waited ten mins for someone to come take our payment and ended up walking up to the hostess stand to do it ourselves. Very disappointed in first impressions this place made. Make sure you make a reservation since it works sometimes and not others.

The hostess told us there's a wait even though we saw a handful of empty tables that were calling our names to be seated. We had to ask the hostess a few time if she forgot about us, she replied by saying she didn't want to stack the server hence the hold in seating. \n\nOur server was kind enough to inform us that sushi was a bit backed up so she encouraged us to order more kitchen items. We really enjoyed the large variety of items that Goyemon provided and there was no maximum of items each person can order at a time. \n\nThe quality of the fish was great, especially for an AYCE joint. One thing that you should remember, you can order HALF portions, which we should have done so we were able to try a larger variety of items [nigiris, rolls, tempura, kitchen, and dessert]. The only downside is, you cannot order Uni or Amaebi during lunch as part of the AYCE menu. Even for dinner, only 1 order allowed per person. \n\nOne highlight of the meal is BEWARE!!! of the 9-1-1 roll, my friend and I thought we could conquer this Spicy Tuna look-a-like roll, infused with habanero juice [which the chefs make themselves]. The server already gave us a fair warning that it's spicy and wow...it was no joke. I thought I could eat spicy but O-M-G...my face was on fire and my tongue lost all sense of its taste, I literally soaked my tongue in my Arnold Palmer for a good 5 minutes before it went back to 75% of its normality.\n\nFor the price [$21.95], you really get a bang for your buck.

The miso soup had 1 piece of seaweed in it (1 total - I didn't get any).. and it was oily and bland. The shrimp tempura I ordered was lukewarm and greasy. My husband was not a fan of spicy chicken - he said it was not spicy at all and was not very hot - temperature-wise. I ordered 6 pieces of salmon sushi and 2 hamachi - that was good but nothing that stood out. Someone mentioned this in an earlier review - the rice was quite warm for sushi. I typically do not mind it but a few pieces were actually hot and it altered the taste. I also had the tiger roll and the rock and roll - all were A-Ok.\n\nNo one took my empty plates...and they were really piling up. When we were ready for dessert it took a full 10 minutes for someone to even acknowledge us. I get that it was crowded but I couldn't get anyone to look at me. The guy next us actually had to get up and physically go to the host stand to get his check.\n\nI'm bummed we had the experience that we did, especially when I've heard such great things but we were not impressed.

And I'll tell you why. \n\nI'm a big fan of AYCE Sushi, whereas my friends are more into individual rolls at really nice Sushi places-almost Sushi snobs. Now I love individual rolls as much as the next guy, it's just I can't afford to always pay for 2 or 3 individual rolls, knowing that the bargain hunter in me wants to take an establishment for all it's worth when AYCE is involved. I love being able to sit for a long time, and take my sweet ass time ordering Sushi and the sides to my hearts content. \n\nI would totally eat here for lunch, except I only have 45 minutes for lunch, and I like to take my time eating sushi, nigiri,sashimi and Side dishes. So I save Goyemon for times with my friends who like to chow down too. And Yes, AYCE places do have a tendency to have slightly lower quality per roll, but-knowing that you just ate about $100 of sushi for a mere $26.95(dinner) or $21.95 lunch- brings a smile to my face every time! I'm happy eating grocery store sushi, so I'm not picky...and Yes I do know what amazing sushi tastes like.\n\nI do love there open seven days a week, I do love the courteous and prompt server girls that barely speak any english, and I do love the fact that there is almost nothing on the menu that is off limits, some piece do however have a limit of 1, or 1 per order. \n\nI like to go in with a totally empty stomach, which can be bad at times if you don't like to wait. Usually the wait at Goyemon is about 15-25 minutes depending on what night of the week. One drawback is that it's a pretty small sushi place as far as sushi places go, and the bigger the group the longer the wait due to the limited though intimate space. Take note that if you waster food, they WILL charge you for excess waste-which is pretty standard in most places.\n\nAnother thing you can do is order the next round as you get an order placed in front of you. I like to do a sampler of a little bit of everything, but some of my best friends go straight for the jugular skipping any roll with rice and ordering Nigiri & Sashimi (Unagi, Salmon, Tuna, and Urchin) plate after plate after plate. My personal favorites are the Volcano Roll (baked YUM!) The Dragon Roll, and Salmon Roe.\n\nOne of the things I did notice is that if you order the most expensive stuff on the menu over and over, it comes out very quickly at first, and as each order goes in, they take more and more time to get it out to you.\n\nBut, seeing how there's no time limit...you've got time to spare! ;) Also, if it's your first time there, sometimes you'll space off and not realize a roll is 8 pieces, so if you want to try everything, ask for a 1/2 roll (4 pcs) so you can pick two rolls at a time.\n\nOn top of it all, you get a cool little atmosphere, great for hanging with friends, and nice hustle and bustle by the staff, and round it all out with dessert (I love the Red Bean Ice Cream!) and leave a fat & happy Buddha belly!\n\nI love bringing people here! Be sure to check out the awesome sword in glass in the wall in the men's bathroom!\n\nCheers!\n\n~MikeB", 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2013-03-04', 'type': 'review'}

Therefore, this was also the first restaurant I considered to go back in January. However, I was a bit concerned about people's comment about the bad service here. Finally, I went to Sushi Yama in January and was very satisfied with Sushi Yama. \n\nThis week I am in town again. Really want to give this place a try because of the good review about food quality. Also I am planning to go on Friday lunch and did not expect this place would become too busy, and hopefully I won't encounter the service issue that other patrons mentioned. \n\nUnfortunately, I end up have all these first hand experience with a cocky waitress. I called in advance and ask them if there is one hour limit for lunch time. The host told me that I can eat there for 1.5 hour. I think it is quite reasonable because we don't like to be rushed. When we were seated, I saw the Uni and sweet shrimp are not included in the lunch. I was not very happy about it because if you look at the menu online, it was a bit misleading. Then I saw the 45 minutes limit on the menu and I tried to clarify with the waitress. I told the waitress that we just called the host and she said we can eat here for 1.5 hours. The waitress insisted that 45 minutes is the limit stated on the menu and it has always been the rule. Well, I just spoke to the host 10 minutes ago and now I am getting the total different information. Then, this WONDERFUL waitress said the time limit is 45 minutes, it is up to you if you want to eat here or not. I don't trade off being respected and welcomed no matter how the food quality is. It really upset me. Later on, she added on if they are not busy, they don't really enforce the time limit strictly. So I figured out that was why the host said 1.5 hours when I called the restaurant. \n\nIt would just be a lot easier that if the waitress explained they don't enforce this strictly instead of telling me it's up to me to stay or go. I think she maybe too exhausted and she feels better if she doesn't need to serve that many customers.\n\nSo, finally we walked away and went to Umiya and enjoyed the great sushi and excellent service there.

I sampled several half rolls, and they were all tasty with fresh ingredients. I just feel that with an imposed time limit for AYCE you really don't want to worry about being able to get the chef's attention since the wait to get your roll is still pretty solid once you do place the order, unless it is nigiri.

I talked with the chef and he told me that they have the only lychee gelato around. I ordered that and the green tea brulee.

LOL\n\nMy boyfriend and I tend to stay away from specialty rolls because they typically taste the same and they just take up room in our belly real estate.\n\nThe things that impressed me here was:\n- The freshness of the sushi, even out here in the desert.\n- The fact that it\'s an AYCE place but the sushi chefs still make the perfectly proportioned nigiri. They don\'t try to stuff you with rice so that you get full faster. They keep the integrity of the sushi and keep the proportions the same throughout the meal.\n- Some people say service slowed down as the meal went on, but we didn\'t feel that at all. The service was great throughout the meal.\n- The actual food-- as described in the following.\n- They have stamp cards! Even though we\'re not local, we asked for one because we come out to Vegas a lot.\n\nWe had tons of nigiri.\nThe salmon was good, but the salmon belly was fatty and delicious. We loved the yellowtail. The tuna was good, but wasn\'t our favorite. The albacore was good, nothing special. White tuna was good too. The scallops and the kanpachi weren\'t bad, but we\'re not huge fans of those to begin with.\nYou HAVE to look at the blackboard. They list the specials for the day. I was sad because they didn\'t have the blue fin tuna or the toro (fatty tuna). But they had the salmon belly and the kanpachi.\nWe also had the sweet shrimp and uni, which are part of the regular menu, but the portions are limited. 1 serving per person (which consists of two pieces per person).\n\nThe braised pork belly was ON POINT. It was fatty, flavorful, and delicious.\n\nAlso, the dessert was awesome. I had the green tea creme brulee which was amazing. I love creme brulees to start with! We also had a vanilla mochi ice cream. It\'s probably store-bought, but I loved the flavor of the vanilla bean. I was extremely satisfied. Next time I\'ll try the lychee sorbet.\n\nThis isn\'t to say that there weren\'t bad parts about the experience:\n- The miso soup was bland.\n- The baked mussels were slightly bland. They weren\'t BAD, but I probably wouldn\'t order them again.\n- The chicken yakitori... it\'s just chicken doused in teriyaki sauce. Not impressed.\n- THE WAIT: We got there and there seemed to be just one group in front of us, but it took 45 minutes for us to sit down. It\'s such a small venue, you have to expect a wait.\n\nEven with the "cons," I still love the food here. I\'ll be back here for sure, it\'s on my "MUST GO" list along with the Oyster Bar.', 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2013-05-17', 'type': 'review'}

Honestly, I wasn\'t impressed the first time I tried their AYCE.  I intentionally did not write a review thinking that I should try them some other time. Or, maybe I went there on one of my  "bad taste buds" days.  By trying them the second time, I was giving them and myself the proverbial "benefit of the doubt".  I was actually intrigued and surprised to see some of the high praises and Hallelujah reviews about Goyemon.  Having lived in Japan (I was stationed in Iwakuni, Japan and travelled around the country) for two years, I\'ve had the once in a lifetime experience to actually taste what the cuisine, both regional and national, is really like.  It may not make me an expert on sushi-ya, but I can claim some kind of leverage over the regular sushi and self proclaimed Japanese food lovers outside the Land of the Rising Sun.  \n\nI returned to Goyemon at the behest of a friend.  We were initially going to Sushi Mon, then changed his mind to Oyshi, then finally decided on Goyemon last minute.  I was OK with it.  I thought my second trip would give me more reason to form and write down my opinion(s).  So here it is.\n\n- just like the first time I came, there was a long line, or scattered groups of people, waiting to be seated.  The parking was somewhat limited.  It was lunch time on a Tuesday.  Always a good sign, you might think.  \n\n- After an hour, we were finally sat down right by the front door where people were standing up and gathered, waiting to be seated as well.  We had to take the table otherwise we would\'ve waited longer.  \n\n- We both opted for the AYCE lunch.  There were only two ladies working the tables and 2 guys behind the sushi counter, an older Asian guy and a younger Latino guy . It took a good 15 minutes before the lady came and asked for our drinks, and get our orders.\n\n- Drinks came, followed by our orders.  They came incomplete, and few wrong ones.  It didnt matter to us.  We\'re both hungry so we didn\'t care since we knew we could re-order the next time she got closer to our table. Wrong. She didn\'t get near our table until after half an hour because she was busy taking and delivering orders somewhere else.  I was worried our 2 hour limit would expire way before we could get our third and fourth round of orders.  \n\n- the nigiris came and was surprised and disappointed with the shari.  Making sushi rice is an art in itself.  I remember watching the itamaes in Japan manually fanning and painstakingly and delicately mixing the steamed rice with seasoned vinegar.  What I had in Goyemon on both occasions were their version of "broken rice".  The rice weren\'t sticky and they would break down as soon as it hit  the wasabied soy sauce.  The rice literally disintegrated.  I was so close to asking for a spoon since the chopsticks were useless .  (FYI:  In Japan, chopsticks are never used when eating sushi.  They use fingers.)  \n\n- Their wasabi was obviously made into paste from powdered green colored horseradish. It had neither bite nor kick.  Normally, they would clear up your sinuses and bring you to tears for a second or two.  Their\'s was just light green, grainy and dry   Their gari (pickled ginger) didn\'t spend enough time bathing in its pickling brine.  It was bland!  The fish  that were served to us were haphazardly cut and unevenly sliced.  Where\'s the "aijou"?\n\n- The tempuras, rolls (handwrapped and deep fried), baked and fried appetizers were decent.  The miso soup that I ordered at the very beginning came in towards the end of our meal and was meh, as in really, MEH! It was all broth. I didn\'t see any diced tofu or wakame seaweed in my soup.  Their poke salad was not really poke (go to Island Sushi, folks!). \n\n- I finished my meal with an order of green tea ice cream.  Ordinary.   It is safe to say that I\'ve tried and tasted all the items on their AYCE menu in my two visits.  My friend looked at me, and said:  "Sorry".  He knew I did not enjoy the meal.  And he read me like an open book!\n\nFor the price we paid, I personally think we were robbed but then again its the standard going price for AYCE in the valley.  There\'s just something fishy (no pun intended) about going to a sushi place not owned, run and staffed by non Japanese, and recognizing that most of the non-white customers on both days I was there were Koreans.  I am not hating. Just saying.\n\nI also observed (while its taking them forever to deliver our orders) that most of the customers were ordering and pigging out mostly on fried entrees and rolls, and not on nigiris.  That\'s when I hypothesized that the 5 star reviews I\'ve seen and perused on YELP must have been based on the fried entrees, rolls and desserts.  Makes perfectly sense now ;) \n\nFool me once, blame on me :) Fool me twice, not coming back!  \n\n(I was told that Sushi Mon and Goyemon are owned and ran by the same non Japanese owners. Is there truth to that?)', 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2013-06-16', 'type': 'review'}

Smart couple. \n\nI LOVE their spicy tuna rice cracker but unfortunately it's only on their dinner menu.  Pork belly is hit or miss for me there (also only on the dinner menu). I love it when it's super tender but have had orders when it's more on the chewy or burnt side. Bff and I ordered nigiri which I don't normally order.  We did enjoy the garlic tuna, super white was OK, she enjoyed the cajun albacore. I was sad that my green tea ice cream which I always look forward to was half melted by the time I got it and BFF didn't expect her tempura ice cream to be soggy as opposed to the crunchy outside she expected :(\n\nThe reason I didn't give a 5 star rating as I would've last year is that the service went downhill. I remember staff being more attentive with filling my water and more friendly upon entering the restaurant.

Sushi House Goyemon has a full bar and good selection of sakes.\nWe had so many orders of everything (see pics ) but the stand outs were the Ama Ebi, special grilled white tuna, and the grilled pork belly. Everything on the menu comes in small portions only 1 or 2 small pieces but the wait staff service was spot on even though there was no an empty seat for 5 min the entire night.

It maybe sits 50 people max which makes for an intimate dining experience whether you want it to be or not. I came by myself on a Sunday afternoon and had to wait 30 minutes for a table and because I had nothing else to do and wasn't rage hungry, I waited. There were a few open spaces at the bar, but I honestly think they were trying to maximize the service experience; instead of packing the house, they pace themselves which I guess I can appreciate.\n\nI'm not the biggest fan of AYCE but had faith in the reviews about the quality here, and really sometimes I just want to get the most bang for my buck. What I like about this place is how un-American the execution is; portion sizes are....reasonable and I don't mean that in a bad way. Sometimes you go to these AYCE places and the rolls are offensively large and the nigiri sushi pieces are big but so flavorless. Goyemon does an amazing job of portioning out  smaller but excellent pieces of fish, so I really felt like I got my money's worth. My favorite roll that I had was the crispy rice tuna; crunchy, salty, savory bites of tuna heaven! Also had the salmon, eel, albacore and tuna nigiri-all very fresh and delicious. I'm pretty boring when it comes to sushi and mostly stick to nigiri so can't speak to the rest of their jazzed up rolls, but the fish spoke for itself: quality.\n\nAlso had a few appetizers like the miso soup, shrimp tempura and fried gyoza, all fantastic. I'd come back to try some more of the apps, particularly the pork belly that everyone is raving about in Goyemon's reviews.\n\nAll in all, a quality sushi experience at an AYCE price that was worth the wait.", 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2013-07-02', 'type': 'review'}

Before coming here, I was a fan of Yama Sushi, which is still really yummy, but now that I've been introduced to this place, I don't know...I think I might have to come here now rather than Yama.  \n\nWe arrived with a party of  6 and the hostess told us it would take about an hour and 15 minutes or so.  The place is small with a main dining area and two larger tables to the side of the restaurant for larger parties.  We ended up waiting about 50 minutes or so, which wasn't too bad!  There are a few tables with chairs outside so you can sit back and kick it.  \n\nNow onto the food... portions of their nigiri are smaller than what I'm used to in regular sushi restaurants, however, I think it's the right portion because it's not overwhelming and it makes you want to order more.  Fish is fresh and delicious..melts in your mouth taste, which is awesome, rice on the nigiris, perfectly packed and does not fall apart when dipping into soy sauce, this alone deserves a single star.  Sushi rolls were amazing to taste and the the size of the rolls were pretty generous.  My favorite would have to be the spider roll and dragon roll.  I had to get two of the spider rolls because it was that good.  They made it fresh so the soft shell crab came out nice, warm and crunchy.  Price came out to be about $34/person, which is not bad depending on how much you plan on grubbin'!  When we come to sushi places where it's AYCE, we always try to get the bang for our buck.  I definitely can't wait to come back here on our next trip to Vegas.  \n\nStaff was friendly, food came out quick, prices are affordable for AYCE,  bathrooms are clean.  I really enjoyed my experience here!  \n\nDesserts...I had the vanilla mochi and it was nothing special.  I wish they had more flavors of the mochi rather than just vanilla and strawberry.  I could really care less about the dessert though cause really it's all about the sushi here.

I always give other places the benefit of the doubt but they always leave me wanting more and also feeling angry that I wasted a perfect opportunity to get another stamp on my loyalty card LOL \n\nTop Reasons Goyemon is currently #1 for AYCE:\n*Freshness- I think since they're so busy all of the time they go through fish fast so all of their items are fresh & of good quality.. I love their scallop, yellowtail jalape\xf1o, tuna, salmon, squid, ikura, uni & amaebi nigiri~!!!\n*Size- The rice to fish ratio is perfect and their nigiri is not too huge so you can sample a little bit of everything.\n*Appetizers- A good variety ...I always get the tuna poke salad, miso soup with shrimp head & pork belly.   \n*Rolls- I've never had a roll here LOL but they look huge which some people might consider a plus \n*Desserts- unlimited and I am addicted to the lychee sorbet ahhhhh\n*Service- I find that service at the bar is waaaaaaaaaay better than at the tables so try to score a seat there if you can!  \n\nThe only negatives I can think of are that it's always so busy so go at a weird time~\n\nHOT TIP: Ask for fresh wasabi at no extra charge", 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2013-07-09', 'type': 'review'}

My first two times I came to Goyemon when I ordered, I ordered a lot the first time and the server gave me this warning of a sort that if I don't finish the food, I have to pay extra. Personally, I don't like people telling me stuff like that just because I know I wouldn't order more than I could eat, but I understand a lot of people don't finish their food and they just want to be pre-cautious.The servers are busy usually, but I also feel like they try not to make eye contact with you or something so you don't order more or something, for obvious reasons. So when you need something, you have to raise your hand and speak up.\n\nThe food I would say is quite good. I am very satisfied with the quality of the rice and fish they serve. I personally love rolls, and so I am really satisfied with the rolls that they serve. I only wish they had a wider selection. Their nigiri is delicious as well.

MAHALO to awesome Yelper friends with hookups to a private room!  The sake options are awesome, and for $8, you can have a 3-shot sampler of any sake on their menu.  Their appetizer, sushi/rolls and dessert offerings also give you a wide variety with no limits.  The must trys - pork belly (lots of melt in your mouth fat that works), salmon belly nigiri, salmon collar (they cook this beautifully - I believe it is a superior part of the fish), the ecstasy roll (albacore, tuna, seaweed, masago, yum yum sauce - all the flavors and textures were lip-smacking good), and yuzu or lychee sorbet.

I always criticize food places and I\'ve eaten a good amount of sushi. Having gone here tonight with my boyfriend\'s family (and still bloated from dinner), I thought this place deserved my first yelp review. Here it goes:\n\nRestaurant and Ambience: I have been to Goyemon more than 6 times for AYCE. Each time, the restaurant is fairly busy and full. For a party of six, I had to wait about 45 minutes for a table. Bathrooms were always clean and the sword on display above the toilet is pretty cool. The menu is similar to that of SushiMon on Maryland because they have the same owner. AYCE is everything on the menu, the specials on the chalkboard, as well as the ones on the placemat. What I love about this sushi place is that you are able to do half orders of special rolls which gives you more opportunity to try different rolls without pressure of over ordering.\n\nSushi: My favorite special rolls are the Lemon roll, Pastel roll, and Crunchy Rice roll. Each one has a distinctive flavor characteristic to the roll, which is nice because I\'ve been to some sushi places (great sushi) but the rolls feel heavy and complicated. In these, you taste the fish and the ingredients compliment each other. For dinner, I also order the grilled cajun salmon and pork belly. Did I mention that dessert is AYCE too? Not only mochi, but red bean or lychee sorbet, fried tempura ice cream, and specials like the chocolate mousse. They have hot green tea but it tasted more like hot barley tea, which I didn\'t mind because I love barley. Service was friendly and prompt tonight. Food came out reasonably fast for bulk ordering. There were some slow points.\n\nOverall: I keep coming back to this place with occasional visits to try out other sushi restaurants. The nigiri fish are a bit smaller for my liking and tonight, it wasn\'t as moist as the last time I had tried them. I don\'t find their appetizers "craving" worthy although they are decent. The grilled salmon are also ordered by piece and their about the size of your thumb. It \'s not comparable to the grilled slab you get from Yama sushi. I guess I just have a problem with portions, but I overall like the place enough to be a regular.\n\nIF you want to become a regular, ASK FOR A STAMP CARD! It works for Sushi Mon too and the 11th AYCE is free. Yay free sushi!', 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2013-08-18', 'type': 'review'}

The dessert menu is by far the best I've seen on any AYCE menu. The mochi and green tea ice cream were sooo good! They even have chocolate mousse, just the perfect ending to a great dinner.\n\nYou may have to wait if you come with a group of 5 or more, and they stop seating at 2am, so make sure to get there with enough time.

I haven\'t had anything I disliked and I really like the fact that you can order "half rolls" from their specialty rolls menu!!

It does expire though, so it certainly awards frequency in visits or large parties. They do not combine stamp cards, so remember to bring it!\n\nI usually order Tuna, Yellowtail, and Salmon nigiri and hand rolls. Fortunately, they\'re very good here and one sushi chef in particular handles the fish very well. I like the specialty rolls like the Hurricane, Red Dragon, and Mahalo (which is just a Spam Musubi in roll form, but still so great). I usually go for ones with different fishes and possibly shrimp tempura, but no cream cheese (or I just ask for it to be omitted).\n\nAdditionally, service is good and the location is easily accessible.

I usually eat the stuff that has been either baked or cooked in some way because I'm a loser (or so I've been told by various companions of mine at sushi restaurants).

Skip the soy sauce (contains gluten!) and the mayo-based sauces and you're golden.\n\nIt's expensive, like all other sushi restaurants, and I'm skeptical of the quality of their fish for that price like I am with all other sushi restaurants, but given that it tastes so good I'll give it the benefit of the doubt. \n\nThe only real problem I have is that given the price of the all-you-can-eat, I feel like I have to eat at least 3 rolls to break even so I always leave there feeling like I've eaten way more than I should! \n\n\n(To clarify, I prefer wild-caught fish over farmed fish, but they make no mention on the menu or anywhere else about the sourcing of their fishes, and when I asked the waitresses didn't know.

The restaurant sits at the of a very quiet strip mall, well at least at 9:00pm it was quiet. Hostess was pleasant and sat us, but when we told her that we were all probably going to do AYCE, she only gives us 2 AYCE menus so we request for more. She never came back w/ them so we asked our server. He never came back w/ them. So we asked the busser, finally! Someone understands that 7 people shouldn\'t be sharing 2 freaking menus!\n\nOur waiter took his time taking our drink orders and even more time getting them to us. Even longer to take our orders which is a bit frustrating considering that they place an hour restriction on their AYCE! Needless to say-- their service sucked.\n\nOn to the eats-- mediocre at best. I\'m sorry but if you can\'t get garlic tuna right-- WTF is wrong with you?! It\'s my fav and has got to be the easiest f-ing thing to make. First off I didn\'t taste any garlic, it was more of a "lemon" tuna. And then I ordered a cut roll, it was more rice than sushi. \n\nGoyemon, I understand you\'re a small establishment and you want a good turnover on the tables, but if your servers suck, take their time with orders and stand around talking to other staff members for the majority of their shift (as they did the night we came in) then lift the hr limit bc your price point for what we rec\'d was quite upsetting. \n\nOk, bye.', 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2013-12-15', 'type': 'review'}

The dessert is also unlimited (surprise, surprise), and you cannot go wrong with Mochi Ice Cream or the Lychee.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that this restaurant does not take reservations. If you are with a large group, you may have a long wait ahead of you, even on a weekday.

All were cut nicely and tasted fresh. I got a few orders of baked mussels and a tuna poki salad. Both of which were great.\n\nProbably my favorite thing about Goyemon is they allow AYCE patrons to order half rolls, score! I ordered a half ecstasy, a half pastel and a half calico along with a pixie roll. \n\nThe pixie roll was my least favorite, it was wrapped in soy paper and the seaweed paper, but the seaweed was too chewy, I had trouble breaking it up. It wasn't like that on the other rolls however. \n\nMy favorite was the ecstasy roll, I ended up ordering another half of that. Then of course tempura ice cream for dessert.\n\nI should note that I wasn't alone, so don't go thinking I put all that away on my own :)\n\nI gave it 4 stars due to the space alone, really crowded and it feels like your on top of the tables around you, not for the food.

Owned by the name owner as Sushi Mon and Monta. But in comparison to Sushi Mon, much classier and nicer setting. \n\nIf you check out the menu, and if you've been to Sushi Mon, you'll recognize how a LOT of the menu is the same as the Sushi Mon menu. \n\nThis place is great for nigiri and roll lovers. They have a wide variety of normal nigiri as well as daily specials that they post on Facebook as well as the chalkboard inside their restaurant. They periodically even have toro (limit 1 order per person), and sometimes salmon belly (mmmm fatty !) \n\nFor a wide ranged of sushi eaters, this is the place to go. If any of my friends are in town, and they crave for sushi, this is where i bring them. \n\nAppetizers - check out their place mats for their specials (grilled pork belly, seared yellow tail, sashimi salad). Pretty good if you are interested in those things. Grilled pork belly is good but gets boring fast (really fatty xD). Seared yellow tail isnt bad. i think it has a yuzu sauce but they kind of overcook the fish so its a little firm. The sashimi salad is not bad. Decent amount of various chopped fish (salmon, tuna, etc). Nice way to start off the meal ! Not too much of an appetizer person but their mussels are pretty good as well. \n\nNigiri -  their salmon and yellowtail are usually pretty spot on. Their amaebi (sweet shrimp) is usually pretty good, and this place will give you the head (deep fried) upon request with order. Uni (sea urchin) is a hit and miss (like all other places). \n\nAlways check out their special menu. They sometimes have some rarer fishes on there as well (amberjack, etc) as well as some more peculiar styles like jalapeno masago, etc. \n\nRolls - they have a super wide range of rolls. Traditional maki rolls, to the popular rainbow, spider, or dragon rolls, to the less traditional but very popular mahalo roll (essentially a spam musubi roll), etc. 1/2 rolls are offers for some (not all) rolls. \n\nDessert - this is one of the FEW places that include dessert in the AYCE. More than that, its unlimited. They used to have a wide variety of desserts (green tea cake, green tea creme brulee, etc) but now, they have only ice creams, mochi ice creams, and tempura ice cream. still pretty good ! \n\nOverall, great place to go.. Be aware of the time you go. They do get VERY busy and wait times can get ridiculously long (1-2 hours) so if you dont wanna wait, go earlier =] But, they are also open late too !

Make sure to get those stamps!\n\nMy go-to AYCE sushi place! Is it the best? Well, that\'s subjective. If you\'re looking for a solid AYCE for the quality and price, this is it. Disclaimer: Keep in mind that all-you-can-eat quality sushi cannot compare to the super fresh level of excellence of SOME, real, authentic sushi places. I wouldn\'t compare this Kabuto or other ala carte, higher-quality joints. This is strictly based in comparison to other AYCE places.\n\nAMBIANCE: Decor is clean, intimate, but without the creepy silent vibes or weird football jerseys on the wall. Low mood lighting, laid-back, and doesn\'t feel too casual. You don\'t need to be too dressy either.\n\nSEATING: Try getting a seat at the bar! Intimidated on how to order? Make eye contact with the sushi chef facing you even he looks busy, then say what you\'d like! \n\nService is definitely hit-or-miss once in a while. This place is popular on the weekends especially during dinnertime. Last time I was here, it was still quite busy on a weekday dinner rush hour. Always expect a wait! A party of 5+ can be very difficult to seat! I believe they don\'t take reservations over the phone, but I heard this changed according to some other diners. If you\'re just dining with one other person, it\'s a lot quicker, especially if you say you don\'t care if you\'re seated at a table or the bar.\n\nFOOD: I\'ve been here countless times (enough to fill 5 of their stamps cards and a few paycheck\'s worth!), and the fish has always tasted fresh, crisp. Fish portion is generous. They don\'t try to load you up on rice unless you\'re ordering mostly rolls. Love the questionable super white tuna. The ubiquitous, americanized rolls are usually on-point, large, and presented beautifully. My fave is the moon roll!\n\nTry ordering half-orders in case you end up disliking a particular roll. This way, you can sample many types of rolls. Too often do I see the people next to me saying they are not eating their rolls because they had too much of it or didn\'t prefer it. They end up not knowing you can order half! Ex: say "half dragon" or "half" whatever.\n\nIt varies on who your chef is when it comes to execution. A few times, my roll or nigiri has come out looking like a beauty school drop-out :C sometimes, consistency is an issue when it comes to presentation.\n\nVERDICT: Although Goyemon is hyped up, it\'s really because they try to bring better quality fish to the masses of the AYCE crowd. Service can suffer when it\'s packed. Last time I was here, our server totally forgot about us sitting in the corner of the bar! When he saw my drink was completely empty, he tried to make it up to us by diligently coming back and checking on us since then.\n\nFun for a date-night spot or a small get-together. A solid experience and hands-down one of my favorite AYCE sushi spots.', 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2014-02-28', 'type': 'review'}

If I had to go with a not so healthy roll, I\'d go with the Hurricane Roll (shrimp tempura on the inside).  On a lucky day, the daily specials may include Toro, Blue Fin Tuna and Salmon Belly. \n\nOne of the things that stands out about Goyemon & Sushi Mon, is that their dessert menu is also AYCE.  The only other place that did this was Yama Sushi, but no more.  For that reason, you can\'t go wrong with Goyemon.  On a busy night, you may find yourself waiting 2 hours.

Salmon belly, ikura, and uni are my favorite. Udon is yummy and included in their AYCE menu as well. One of my favorites! Not many AYCE sushi places include udon with their menu so this is a plus for me. For dessert Green Tea Creme Brulee and chocolate moose is yummy!! Also included in their ayce but not listed on the menu so just order it haha\n\nTheir price of $27 a person for AYCE is pretty average here in Vegas. What is pretty ridiculous tho is that it's the same price for kids.

They required reservations to be made, by request, from a site, that was posted through their facebook (www.mongroupevent.com). Reservations was first come, first serve. The reservation request form was simple to fill out, name, contact info, number of people, times wanted. I was surprised by this because I got no e-mail confirmation or anything. I had called a few days prior, and the girl who picked up a phone, said she had a list on a paper she found, under correct time and # of people, but had no info if it was confirmed. 2 days ago, (monday, i wanted wednesday), is when i received a confirmation text. \n\nUpon arrival, our reservation was for 7:30. We arrived around 7pm. I had went in to ask to double-check my reservation. Was all good so went outside to sit and wait. There was another yelper there, Chris V., who had an reservation for 7pm, who was still waiting. Doriee and I were like, okay, they are a little backed up. No worries. She glanced into the restaurant to look at the blackboard, where they usually had their specials written. Toro was no where to be found on the menu. I mean sure, it was not on the original "promised" special items on their site (blue fin tuna, wagyu beef, foie gras), but day before, many have said they had AYCE toro. That got us really excited prior to arrival. By 7:35, i had went inside and asked to see the estimated time on wait before we get a table. She glanced around the dining area and she said there is a table whos paying, and will be leaving soon. Ok ! ... wait a minute ... Chris\' reservation is 7pm.... so i went outside and waited. Less than a few minutes late, my name was called. UHHHH !!!??? OK THATS WEIRD.... Later we saw they were seated AFTER us. That\'s bad on their part. They\'ve been waiting here since before we arrived too.... Just because i went in to ask, i got table faster? \n\nSO ANYWAY.....\n\nWhen our waitress came up to us to take our drink order, we had asked what was avail today and if toro was AYCE today. NOPE. Toro is limit 1 per person. Same for the Foie Gras nigiri. Wagyu beef, sea urchin, and blue fin tuna is AYCE. DANG IT ! sad. SAD!. SUPER SAD ! IMO thats a bad management on their part. Why allow AYCE one day, and be super limited the next? In my opinion, to manage better, to allow maybe like, 5 orders per person. That way, each who wants, gets a fair amount, and not be SUPER limited, but not be free to order. Bad call on their part. Also, as they had posted on their FB on 2nd day, items are avail until they run out? Uhm, there\'s a reason why you had a reservation to begin with. To limit the amount of people you have these two days. Not only did you have AYCE one day and not the other, you allowed walk-in\'s as well. Though it may have been "Said" that its a 1 hour limit on eating time but it is NOT enforced. People sit around and socialize after the end of their meal. No good ! Control and manage better ! \n\nWith that, already a bad start. Doriee and my friend are already upset but we decided to stay and eat, since we were there already. \n\nOrdered 3 toro, 3 amaebi, 3 foie gras, 5 blue fin, 5 yellow tail, salmon, 3 kobe beef, and a half of a 9-1-1 roll to start. \n\nBlue Fin Tuna, was fresh. Each fish piece was actually cut fairly thick. \n\nWagyu Beef Nigiri. First 3 orders. VERY thin and "broken" cuts of meat. Like it ripped open because they sliced too thin. Meat was not tender, as what a high quality meat should be. The "carrot?" topping was a bit weird. Ponzu? sauce used made it weird as well. Was not a good combination at all. poorly executed. \n\nFoie Gras Nigiri - topped with, i believe, fried onions?, seared foie gras, and probably an unagi (or similar) sauce? That was weird too. the sauce used covered the taste of the foie gras. You can really taste the foie gras if you ate a straight up piece, untouched with anything but, in combination with the fried onions, sauce, and rice. flavors gone. poor executed as well, in my opinion. \n\nToro Nigiri (fatty tuna) - the most sought after order. considering we were limited to ONE order per person on the SECOND night of their event, we tried our best to "Savor" the pieces. With my experience with toro, it is supposed to be naturally sweet, super fatty and tender, little to no chewing needed. This toro, thinly cut. not as tender and soft. Some chewy bits as well. SAD ! \n\nAmaebi Nigiri (Sweet shrimp) - this wasnt bad. granted neither of the people i went wanted to eat it, so i ate all 3 orders. Size of the amaebi was actually fairly large. larger than normal actually. nice and sweet, and gives a nice "bite" texture. fresh. \n\nUni Nigiri (Sea Urchin) - considering their no limit on sea urchin, i had high hopes for this as well. Considering their fast usage, i was expecting fresh and sweet. Nope. little to no sweet taste. okay freshness. \n\nOverall experience, meh. Had high hopes for this event, looked forward to it, but was quite the disappoint.', 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2014-03-20', 'type': 'review'}

He was taking multiple orders from multiple customers at once and getting them all out quickly and accurately.  Plus, he told us something we\'ve never hear at a sushi place before: that we could add or subtract whatever we want from the rolls on the AYCE menu and he would make them to order.  How awesome is that!\nAnd I loved that this place had many rolls with ingredients you don\'t see every day at the other places in town.  And all the new ones we tried were very tasty.

Funny because all of us just got off work from SERVING!! On top of it he rarely came to the table to help with our order or even check for satisfaction when one of the girls was missing a few things. I let it be known he sucked and was rude and my girlfriend made a mission to make this guy smile...

Then when we moved away, Goyemon opened so whenever I visited Vegas, I always had to go to Goyemon. It was amazing. It was probably my favorite AYCE sushi place in Vegas. \n\nThe sushi was yummy, they always have some type of specials on the board, and they have other things on the menu for non-sushi eaters. So if you were to come with a huge group of people, you can get a mix of things. \n\nOne of my FAVORITE items from Goyemon has to be the salmon belly! It is delicious, fatty, and never a disappointment whenever I get it. So why, in heaven's name, did I give it 3 stars? Well ... let me tell you a story.\n\nGoyemon had their 3rd Anniversary Customer Appreciation event and it was supposed to last 2 days. They had a list of special items for those days, which included blue fin and toro. With that, they offered the ability for you to make reservations. My friends and I decided to make a reservation for the 2nd day of the event since the 1st day of the event didn't work out with our schedules. \n\nThe excitement built up even more after we found out that on the first day of the event, they did AYCE toro and AYCE uni! OMG! Like, I can't even WAIT. \n\nSo when we went in for our reservation, my excitement turns a little bit sour. Why? Well, we had our reservation for 7:30 pm. We get there a little bit early but we have to wait for a table. I'm sorry .. I thought I had a reservation. So what we find out is .. they are still accepting walk ins and because they're typically a walk in restaurant, they don't quite grasp the reservation concept down that well. We actually didn't get seated until maybe at 8 PM.\n\nAnd then they tell us that there is no AYCE toro tonight, only AYCE uni and waygu beef. Well, gee, thanks. What's the point of having a reservation then? Why would you give AYCE toro one night and not the other night? I wanted to flip multiple tables but since we waited for the table, sat down, and were ready to order, we just stayed. \n\nSo my experience from that is just really really sour. So I learned to just walk in on the days they have yummy specials. That way, I won't be missing out REGARDLESS of what they say. \n\nSo Goyemon gets an average from me. I still like them and will continue to go to them for AYCE sushi. Service can be slow sometimes though and the servers will look at you funny when you order 20 orders of one thing. \n\nOh and LOVE their yuzu sorbet (:", 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2014-05-17', 'type': 'review'}

I'm probably still considered a newbie when it comes to sushi determining what is good and what is great.  From a newbie standpoint, this is great! \n\nWe met up with some friends to dine on their delicious creations.  Since it was AYCE, I was going to take full advantage and try a variety off the menu. It was busy but there were open seats at the bar for immediate seating.  When you sit there, the waitress will handle sides and drinks.  All you have to do it tell the sushi chef's what you'd like. It was pretty great!  They were so quick on our orders and just fun watching them. \n\nI ordered half rolls of the Baked 428, Pete's, Sexy Girl and Frying Jason. The 428 is baked with grilled chicken spread with yum yum sauce, cream cheese, eel sauce and spicy sauce.  Love Love Love this!  I would have been happy with just ordering this.  Can't stop there! Pete's is deep fried sushi with white fish, crab, cream cheese, avocado and eel sauce.  The light texture enveloping this masterpiece from being deep fried made me fall in love with this roll.   Sexy Girl was filled with shrimp tempura, crab and cucumber.  It was then topped with tempura crumb and a spicy garlic sauce which made it totally SEXY! Frying Jason is a baked roll filled with crab, cream cheese, asparagus and avocado topped with spicy yum yum sauce.  Yum Yum indeed!!  I absolutely loved everything I ordered.  \n\nI am definitely a fan and will tell anyone who is in the mood for sushi to go here.

Already the place was packed and we were told that the wait was an hour. So we were given the option to sit at the bar. I thought it was better way for we got superb service in getting our rolls because the chefs were literally right in front of us.\n\nWe opted for the AYCE ($21.95) lunch option which was from 11:45 am to 6 pm. According to the menu, you had 45 minutes to alotted time to do the AYCE which didnt make sense because we were there for at least an hour.\n\nWhat is good to mention is that most of the rolls you can get you have the option of getting a half (4 pieces) or full (8 pieces) roll. I strongly recommend that you get the half rolls so that you have more chances of trying more rolls. Some rolls are only available as a full (refer to menu for they clearly state which ones are not available for half orders). \n\nAs for what I ordered. Man, I will only tell the names but not describe them because this review would go on forever! That\'s what\'s good about doing the ayce option because you can try just about everything!\n\nWhat I got for starters were the Garlic Edamame, Fried Calamari, Ahi Poke, and Shrimp Tempura. Then, we got half orders of the Taylor Roll, Sexy Girl, and Frying Jason, Then full rolls only for the Spider Roll and Pixie Roll. We also tried one order (2 pieces) of the Seared Ahi. Lastly, we finished it up with 2 pieces of Strawberry Mochi.\n\nOriginally, we wanted a table so we can all hang out much more comfortably while we ate, but after sitting at the bar, I think we got our orders much faster for the chefs actually hand you your order instead of your server grabbing it and bringing it out to your table. If you are at the bar, the servers are mainly there to get your drinks, appetizers, and dessert. \n\nOverall, I think that this will be the measuring stick to other sushi places that I will be trying out. The only negative thing that might deserve a mention is the wait time. But after eating here, I can understand why it can be a long wait for they serve good stuff  and the overall size of the place is not that big.

We miss it sooooo much now that we are living in the Bay Area.\n\nWe used to live about 10 minutes away from Goyemon, and we used to go about once every couple of weeks for either lunch ($21.95/person) or dinner ($26.95/dinner). There are some advantages to going for dinner - 1) they serve salmon belly nigiri, which is way better than getting regular salmon nigiri, 2) you can get 1 order of uni (sea urchin) and 1 order of amaebi (sweet shrimp), 3) you can order ramen after 11. Other than these three things, you can pretty much order everything else, including the AYCE dessert, during lunch.\n\nOur typical order when we go for dinner includes the following items: \n1) nigiri - salmon belly, hamachi (yellowtail), saba (mackerel), super white tuna, uni (sea urchin), amaebi (sweet shrimp), snow crab meat, unagi (fresh water eel), and ikura (salmon roe)\n2) rolls - Sexy Girl, Hurricane, Sushi Mon Style Lasagna\n3) side dishes - steamed gyoza, yakitori, shrimp and vegetable tempura, sashimi salad, miso soup, baked green mussels, udon, ramen (after 11pm)\n4) grilled dishes - grilled pork belly, grilled super white tuna, grilled cajun salmon\n5) dessert - lychee sorbet, green ice cream, strawberry mochi, green tea creme br\xfbl\xe9e\n\nThat order listed above might sound like a lot, but trust me, it's worth it. And you have to try these items. There is a reason why we kept coming back week after week, and why this is the first place we want to go eat when we visit Las Vegas. It's also why this is one of the easiest 5-star ratings I can give on Yelp. The only complaint I have about this place is that the wait can be very, very long. The restaurant is not all that big, and if you have a group bigger than 4, it can take 1-2 hours to get seated. They have a couple other restaurants owned by the same group - the other 2 restaurants are called Sushi Mon... both are just as good, and soon to be reviewed by me as well. \n\nIf you ever go to Las Vegas (and you are still reading this review), promise me you'll go to Goyemon or Sushi Mon.

My friend from Vegas strongly recommended forme to try this place before heading back to LA. We came in at around 5pm (group of 5) on a Monday night and the wait was around 20 minutes (not too bad compared to the other reviews). The restaurant was pretty small, but the service was relatively quick and accommodating. There's an hour limit on AYCE dinner. We went on an order rampage immediately, focusing mostly on the nigiri. The rice:fish ratio was a bit off for me (too much rice) but it wasn't too overwhelming.\n\nOnto the fish. I personally ordered a sashimi salad, which was delicious and refreshing. For the nigiri, I tried the tuna, salmon belly (GREAT), octopus, uni (limit 1 order/person), sweet shrimp (GOOD; limit 1 order/person), yellowtail (YES), super white tuna, snow crab hand roll (too much rice), scallops and unagi (always my favorite). The fish was fresh and I felt like I definitely got my money's worth (turned out to be around $32/person). There were a lot of special rolls that looked great as well. My friends liked the rainbow roll, but not the spider roll. They also enjoyed the salmon, salmon belly, uni, sweet shrimp, sashimi salad, edamame (garlic buttered) and miso group. Goyemon offers a bunch of dessert, ranging from green tea or red bean ice cream to vanilla or strawberry mochi. I thought it was nothing special, but was pleasantly surprised by the numerous options.\n\nAll in all, for the same price, I prefer this over a Vegas buffet any day.

Skip the skinny jeans and put on that billowy dress with the stretchy belt because we're having half the ocean's worth of fish for dinner tonight, kiddies!\n\nI'm Seafood's worst enemy and I take no prisoners at Goyemon!  Goyemon is my ultimate favorite place to go for sushi and it's crazy for me to even say that!  I've taken my brother and friends here and they all go crazy for this place.  Nothing in Arizona can compare.  With uni, sweet shrimp, salmon belly, blue fin tuna, unagi, conch, aji mackerel, garlic tuna, and black tobiko being on their menu, how can I not love this place?  There's so many more amazing bites and everything is fresh [Remember:  fresh salmon should smell like cantaloupe!]!  Even with the all-you-can-eat, they don't try to rip you off by offering more rice and less goodies like a lot of other places do.  It just proves how great their work ethics are.  Don't forgot to check out their ever-changing daily specials.\n\nGoyemon is a trendy little place and it's nicely decorated.  The wait time can be pretty crazy and they're always busy.  The wait staff is pretty on point here as long as you're nice and polite.  Loud annoying people generally are given much worse service as we've seen first hand with the annoying drunken jerks next to us.  But in the city where clubrats and lushes prevail, I can see how they're just over it.  Stay on The Strip, fiends! Let me just have Goyemon all to myself.  Give me an hour, dim the lights, and don't come in when my stretchy belt is hanging on the doorknob.

You usually have to wait a while for a table, but if you're eating at the bar, you can go right in if there's seats open. \n\nI recommend not ordering too much off the menu right when you sit down. You have to finish everything or they will charge you ala carte prices, so you should order from the sushi chef as you go. You can order half-rolls so that you can try more types of specialty rolls without filling up so fast, and you can even order 1 rather than 2 nigiri at a time. \n\nDon't get the spicy tuna roll because it's just a plain roll with nothing else in it. The pork belly was just o-kay...it wasn't super special and it's just too greasy. The tempura ice cream is not that great either--the tempura batter isn't crispy, just bready. Next time I'll just get 1 or 2 mochi ice cream, because the green tea ice cream that I had wasn't a strong green tea flavor, more on the bland side. \n\nThe $5 sake I got was such a generous amount, I kind of regretted ordering it since it made me feel full too fast.

We arrived at 2:15 am, and the sign on their door says that last call is at 2:30 am, so we still had time to order. We were seated and we ordered the chicken teriyaki bowl and green tea ice cream. Two simple items that tasted fine. However, I was in the middle of my meal and at 2:45 am, the woman who seated us approached us and humbly said, "Sorry, I don\'t mean to rush you, but can you hurry up so I can close the restaurant?" I thought we had had 15 minutes left, but I guess the entire staff wanted to go home, so they decided to rush us so they could close early. I wasn\'t even finished eating! We saw another table leave very shortly after that, and we were the only two left, with the rest of the staff just standing there watching us, waiting for us to leave. It wasn\'t even 3:00 am yet, but we left at 5 \'til. I guess they actually close at 2:30 am instead. I took the rest of my food to-go, and we left.

I mean thats an amazing combo of fish. It taste so good! \n\n911 roll- Seriously the spiciest roll out there hands down. When we got it I thought, wow what a simple roll but boy I was wrong. It's spicy tuna with habanero sauce. Now I've had sushi rolls with habanero sauce before and it was NOT as spicy as this roll. This had my mouth on fire.... but in a good way! \n\nNigiri- Very fresh! The garlic tuna was to die for. And of course my favorite Cajun Albacore! \n\nSpider Roll- Very large roll of sushi wrapped in soy paper and not seaweed. Might need to bite it twice to finish. Very amazing flavors of the soft shell crab inside. BOMB! \n\nI honestly loved every single roll I tried. I wanted to keep eating but my stomach would't allow it. The presentation of the rolls and different colors of the fish used was beyond beautiful. I love when my food not only taste amazing BUT looks amazing.

I like that the nigiri  are not so inundated with rice that they overwhelm the fish.  The garlic tuna was super fresh and had an awesome light sauce which I believe was elevated with some yuzu.  The ikura was freaking awesome, fresh and perfect seasoned which is hard to find.  I also loved some baked green muscles the sauce was so yummy and not bland like some places, and the muscles were not to big.  I prefer smaller sized because the bigger ones can get a bit chewy.  I like that you can order half rolls and that they have more unique desserts like chocolate mousse and green tea creme brule.  The green tea creme brule could have used more of a firm sugar top is was more speckled that a layer of crunchyness.  The chocolate mousse was the perfect size for how rich it was.

This place is no exception.  Take my money!\n\nLunch is $23 and dinner is $27.  The only difference is for dinner you get one order of Uni (Sea Urchin) and Sweet Shrimp.  You also get a few more "specials of the day" items to choose from.  Definitely worth it if you eat those things, otherwise try for lunch.  \n\nI\'ve tried eating here before but left after we heard the wait was 2+ hours.  This time, we came at an odd hour (3:30PM) on a Saturday and were luckily able to get seated for 10 people without issue.  Note, NOT everyone in your party has to eat AYCE, which I was surprised to hear.  This worked out great for us.\n\nEverything we ordered was amazingly fresh and tasty.  Definitely not the cheap sh*t. Love the ton of options and the grean tea creme brulee was a nice touch to end it all.  Service was also attentive and quick.  However,  the sushi to rice ratio is not that great here, but the freshness kind of makes up for it.  Just looked at my thumb and that\'s about how much rice you get per sushi (I have a medium sized thumb).  The fish on top is just a small sliver.\n\nWhile I liked this place a lot compared to the other 4-5 AYCE sushi places I\'ve tried in Vegas, there\'s still another AYCE sushi place in Vegas I enjoy a tad bit more.  A better sushi to rice ratio and even more options make me like that place more.  Check out my reviews to find out which one.

Seeing that this may be my last trip to Goyemon (will likely go back to Sushimon), I also ordered my usual 2 orders of green tea ice cream and 2 orders of lychee sherbet, while getting the tempura ice cream just for kicks (the tempura batter gets to you at the second quarter piece you eat).\n\nI'm sad that I will likely not return, unless things change, and I hope that the diminishing quality didn't hit Sushimon as well.", 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2014-11-24', 'type': 'review'}

Even after reading the good reviews about this place, I still wasn't interested in coming here since I already had a favorite sushi spot!

So many reviews here already, so I'll try to keep mine short and sweet. \n\nA few things I would like to point out.....\nFirst, we got lucky with the wait time. They told us we would be waiting about 40 minutes. But because a big party left, it opened up like 3 tables and we only waited about 20 minutes. I thought it was kind of cool that they text you a link that shows your place in line and how long you have waited so far to keep track of your time.\n\nSecond, we unfortunately got a table that was close to the entrance door. It was so crowded and people were waiting inside the narrow entrance way (as if this place isn't tiny enough). I got annoyed because it felt like the whole time, strangers were watching me eat. Sorry, but it sucks when you cant enjoy your meal because people keep looking over your shoulder!\n\nLastly, I'm sorry, but the sushi just wasn't that great. I ordered a few rolls, but nothing stood out or gave me a reason to come back again. They may have sounded fancy on the menu, but the taste was disappointing. However, I will say this. Their rice to meat/fish/veggies/what have you is great. They don't pack on the rice or are not stingy with the other ingredients, which some sushi places definitely do. \n\nAnyway, glad I finally tried it, but no thank you.

They have the freshest garlic ahi tuna nigiri that is a must try. About the same price as all other ayce sushi but waaaay better quality. Desserts included! Service can be a bit spotty but the sushi is so good you won't be disappointed. \n\n**Full story**:\nHow have I not written a review for this place yet?! I guess all the partying in vegas makes me forget about the great food I eat afterwards...lol. \nAnyway, I've frequented this place every time I've come to vegas after I turned 21 and it is the best ayce sushi restaurant I've ever dined at and I've definitely visited my fair share! \n\nI love that this place isn't overly packed even on holiday weekends; I've been here during EDC weekend and memorial day weekend. It's definitely a hidden gem just a few minutes off the strip. \n\nThe ordering system is a little different here than most other ayce sushi restaurants. Instead of giving you 3 rounds to order, they give you a 45 min limit. So you don't get a little sheet of paper that you check off, you just keep ordering from the waiters until your time is up. Your time starts when you order your first item. I haven't had a problem with this being not enough time especially since they give you a last call. However, I haven't been here when it's super packed so I can foresee that possibly being a problem for some people but haven't experienced it myself. \n\nJ casually ordered the garlic ahi tuna along with the rest of our rolls and sushi not knowing that it was going to be probably the best tuna both of us have ever tasted. The tuna was so fresh it was literally ruby red and glistening as it came out. I have never seen a more appealing cut of sushi. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushi-house-goyemon-las-vegas?select=q8fozGYfWJbBHNHrfUgAsg#UnDx5-6zuPhFOyzBufRpSw The slightly tangy sauce that dressed the tuna was perfect and didn't require any soy sauce! We ended up ordering about 10 more orders of the tuna alone LOL. \n\nThe appetizers are pretty standard and the rolls are good too. If you read closely, you can find the rolls that are in smaller portions, about 4 pieces, which is great because you can try a bit of everything without getting too full. I'd definitely recommend coming here with a larger group so you can sample everything but even with only 2 people you can still try a variety of things.\n\nThe price is about $25 total for lunch and if you upgrade to dinner price during lunch, you can order uni and sweet shrimp as well! I'm not a fan of either so I'm content coming here and paying less for lunch :) \n\nAnyway, definitely check this place out and TRY THE GARLIC AHI TUNA.

It is fried just slightly to add a little crunch to your bite.\n \nSalmon Belly: This was a special that day which was very yummy! So moist and melted in your mouth! \n\nTuna Jaw: It was baked I think? It was veryyyyy tasty! This was a special of the day.\n\nSashimi Salad: yummy!! Nice portion of greens and raw fish on top.\n\nSeaweed salad: can never go wrong with seaweed salad :]\n\nEdamame: There is an option between garlic and regular.

There were so many choices from green tea ice cream, red bean ice cream, sherbert, green tea creme brule, vanilla ice cream, green tea mochi, tempura ice cream. I think I am missing a few, but there were so many options!! \n\nThe green tea ice cream and creme brule were both yummy!! Others said the green tea mochi was good too! The tempura ice cream was just plain vanilla with a thick batter. The batter was too thick and not really tempura fried.. so I wouldn't get that again. \n\nThe service was also phenomenal!

This is how it works, they have a la carte options but they also have their all you can eat option. If you like sushi, the all you can eat is a decent deal.

It was an accident and they apologized but definitely something to keep in mind. \n\nLike I mentioned, Goyemon is small and there is a wait on weekends and holidays. So be prepared to wait. It's worth it, but definitely factor in wait time when you come to Goyamen.

We came in on a Sunday night around 6 p.m., and were seated right away.\n\nThe nori/seaweed that they use here is SO flavorful and really adds to the sushi.  This is the only sushi restaurant I've been to in Las Vegas that used seasoned nori.\n\nWhat's amazing about this all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant is that they don't force you to eat like 10 pieces of sushi per roll.  You can order half-orders, which is really convenient, especially on your first time!  Additionally, instead of charging you per piece you do not eat, you have a time limit.  We were not bothered by the time limit, as we were already full.  In fact, the server never even mentioned the time limit.\n\nI ordered Garlic Tuna, Teriyaki Chicken Roll, Mahalo Roll (i.e. Spam roll), Crispy Rice, Spider Roll, Tamago, and a Rice Cracker, which was a special.  For sides, I ordered the fried gyoza, sesame chicken, seaweed salad, tuna poke, and a sashimi salad.  For dessert, I ordered three different flavors of mochi ice cream (no limits for the dessert like most AYCE sushi places either!).\n\nThe Garlic Tuna was amazingly fresh!  The sauce was a bit too lemony for my taste, but the fish was delicious!  I love crispy rice rolls, and it did not disappoint here!  I have to say that Spider was probably my favorite roll.  The soy paper was a nice touch and I loved the mix of deep fried soft shell crab and fresh crab meet.  I am a sucker for non-fish rolls also, so I would definitely recommend the Teriyaki Chicken and Mahalo Roll as well.\n\nThe sides were hit-or-miss.  The tuna poke and sashimi salad were not fresh at all.  The tuna poke was extremely disappointing and lacked flavor.  This was surprising considering how impressive the garlic tuna roll was.  The sesame chicken was also disappointing as it tasted undercooked and did not seem to have any sauce or seasoning on it (not even sesame seeds!).  The dessert, of course, was delicious.\n\nThe service was weird because our servers switched in the middle of our meal.  Thus, someone dropped the ball on our side dishes and we basically had to reorder it, but it did come out very quickly after we mentioned it to our new server.  The rolls came out pretty quickly (with a few exceptions), but at times it was hard to flag down our server.  Overall, both of our servers were friendly though. \n\nI would definitely return to Goyemon, as it was one of the better sushi restaurants that I have been to in Las Vegas.

Granted, I ordered a shrimp tempura roll, but I felt that the taste itself was on the bland side. Generally, whenever I've had shrimp tempura rolls at other establishments, there was more of a robust shrimp flavor. Perhaps it was a difference in seasoning used, but it just didn't hold true to the flavor that I normally expect of this roll. The miso soup was good, hot and tasted as I expected it to. My friend ate the salad, so I don't have feedback on that, but it looked appropriately seasoned.\n\n3 stars for today's experience, the staff was friendly, but perhaps my expectations were too high, as the food itself was not as tasty as I hoped it would be.", 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2015-03-02', 'type': 'review'}

I was not disappointed!\n\nWe walked in at about 5pm on a Thursday afternoon. The restaurant was fairly full but we only had to wait a few minutes for them to clear off our table (party of four). Arriving at an "in-between" time (late lunch, early dinner) turned out to be a good idea, because towards the end of our meal about an hour later the place was packed and there was a line. \n\nThe AYCE price was $26.95 per person for dinner (lunch price is only $21.95. Guess who\'s coming back for lunch soon?) The AYCE includes everything on the menu besides drinks. Appetizers, miso soup, grilled items, salads. Even dessert! Unlimited dessert! What. A. Deal. I seriously spent most of my time looking at the menu while I ate, trying to decide what I was going to order next. \n\nMy advice would be to order as many things as you want at once, because it does get busy and food takes a little while to come out. There\'s an hour limit on dinner, so you want to spend more time eating than waiting. Keep in mind, though, that they will charge for leftovers including rice, so only order what you can eat. \n\n\nWe tried a few rolls. I liked the one called Sexy Girl. Nigiri is delicious...get the ahi and the unagi because both are spectacular. Also, please be sure to try the pork belly off the "grill" portion of the menu, because it just melts in your mouth. Faaaaaabulous, dahhling. Like everyone says, the rice to fish ratio is great and you can get the 8 piece rolls in half orders so that you can try more things before you tap out. Everything tastes fresh and is well-flavored.\n\nOther things we tried were the calamari, takoyaki, sashimi salad, tempura, crab roll, shumai (fried and steamed) and the rice cracker, not to mention practically all of the different nigiri on the menu. \n\nFor dessert we had the azuki ice cream, green tea ice cream (mochi and regular), strawberry mochi ice cream, yuzu sorbet (my first time having this. It\'s a citrus sorbet and it is very light and refreshing), and the tempura ice cream. Tempura wasn\'t quite crispy on that one but it was still good. \n\nBottom line: Get the AYCE and make sure everyone on your table has it so that you can all share.  It is so worth your money. The wait staff is attentive and the atmosphere is casual, and you will definitely enjoy yourself whether you are a sushi snob or a fusion fan. It\'s quality sushi to your heart\'s content.

We went in on a Wednesday (April 22nd) with a group of 7. Waited 50 minutes but was quoted 60 so that was great to get in a little bit sooner. We typically come in large groups for celebrations and usually have 2-4 kids under the age of 4. Each parent gets a share plate which is typically $3 as a small child will not eat enough to cover an all you can eat plate. Last night they told us they no longer did share plates unless they were under 3 and we had to pay full price ($26.95) for the children or buy a la carte for them. That was a big disappointment as we've been coming here for over a year without any issues. \n\nOnce we figured out what the kids were going to eat, the service was incredibly slow. The baked rolls tasted burnt, half of our things didn't get delivered to our table, we had to ask multiple times for items and drink orders were wrong. \n\nAll in all it was a disappointment. This was our favorite sushi spot. We will most likely choose a new place to go to that will accommodate children better.

They aren\'t good. Nothing I ordered really "popped". They were good, but they didn\'t leave me flabbergasted and fascinated like Yama Sushi\'s \'No Name\' roll or Kaya Sushi\'s \'Cinderella\' or \'XXX3\' roll does. While eating a roll all I could think was "I need to order more nigiri." Why? Their Sushi Nigiri is by far the best in town that I have had. \n\nSalmon Belly, Salmon Collar, even plain ole\' happy Tuna and Yellowtail were all phenomenal. Melt in your mouth. Oh lord the unagi made me want to order all of it they had in the building. The rice was perfectly made, even a Japanese chef would cry at its delicious chewy and sticky quality I imagine. Their sushi rice is the best I\'ve had in Las Vegas. If you come here, come as a fan of nigir. If you come here as a fan of rolls and rolls only you are going to be disappointed. \n\nMy girlfriend is one of those people , she gives this place a strong 2 1/2 stars. \n\nThe servers were friendly, we had no issues with service.

Our party of 3 was quoted a wait time of 20 mins which I felt wasn't too bad for a holiday weekend. They take down your cell # and text you a link where you can check your place on the wait list. When it's almost your turn, they'll text you again and you can respond whether or not you'll be taking your spot -- great feature IMO so you can leave the restaurant and wander around (though there's not much to walk around in the plaza). If you choose to leave, at least you can text them back to let them know you won't be coming back for your table so it doesn't clog up the line for others.\n\nWe ordered more appetizers and nigiri than rolls, but everything we ordered was delivered quickly and tasted fresh! Rice to fish ratio was fairly small and although they state a time limit, it was never enforced. Service was great - our server came back multiple times to check up on us, take more orders, and refill our water/hot tea (complimentary). They do half rolls here in case you can't finish a full one and there is no limit on desserts! Order the lychee sorbet - it's yum!\n\nWe frequent Goyemon's sister restaurant Sushi Mon as it's closer to our house, but we'll be coming back to Goyemon from now on for AYCE since the fish is more fresh and service is more attentive and friendlier!\n\nAlso, make sure to get a stamp card! You get 1 stamp for every AYCE purchased and a free AYCE after 10 stamps. Make sure you don't lose your card as they do not combine cards & cards expire after 1 year.

We ordered enough to feed a family of 20. \n\nSome notable dishes were the white tuna, cajun albacore, and seared salmon. I also love unagi/eel and this place did not disappoint. I think one of the best things about goyemon is that you can order HALF ORDERS. What!? Don't want a full 8-piece roll? Get a half-order! No more leftover sushi to shove down at the end. I'm not sure if other sushi places did this, but when the waitress offered it to us, I knew Goyemon cared about efficiency and possibly its customers' waistline. \n\nThe service was great.

It was my second visit here and he insisted this place is his close second favorite location for AYCE sushi in vegas. The last time we were both here was last year.\n\nIt was around 4 so we just missed the lunch rush and were happy we didn\'t have to wait too long for seats plus salmon belly was on special, yummmm.\n\nWhat we liked:\nMiso soup: the bf said this was one of the best part of the meal, and it was the first thing he had. I\'ll take his word for it.\n\nSpider roll: wrapped in soy paper. Great texture and crunch from the crab which was perfectly fried and the filling was nice and balanced. Wasn\'t overly saucy either. \n\nSalmon belly: ordered it once and it wasn\'t a really good cut. Then ordered again later and it was perfect. Great big fatty slices of salmon belly that I made sure to savor.\n----\nThe meh:\nUdon soup: bf ordered this as the ending to his meal. it was really just the noodles, broth and green onions, which was written in the menu but I kind of wish some veggies or meat was in there.. \n\nSuper white tuna: I LOVE super white tuna but the one here was not succulent and melt-in-your mouth as I know it to be. There was no sauce whatsoever. Or maybe I missed it lol.. just okay.\n\nYellowtail: very small cut of fish! But still managed to taste a little above average. Was better than the salmon we first got for sure..\n----\nWhat we didn\'t like:\nPork belly: great presentation and meat looked appetizing as in had great char and color. Sadly the flavor really was not there and both slices had large flab of fat right down the middle that was just too unedible. I love pork belly and fat but after eating one slice and forcing the fat down, I couldn\'t do with getting the other fat glob down.\n\nSashimi salad: I did not know the crab mayo stuffing from a typical cali roll would be considered "crab meat" or sashimi for that matter. Yep, they layered this right atop the cubed sashimi pieces and there was a fairly good amount of it more than the actual sashimi. Still ate the whole thing cause had to.. \n\nTakoyaki: does not come dressed with sauce, mayo, aonori, green onions or furikake that should be on top. The two fried balls come with just the sauce on the side to dip. The inside was very mushy and had on or two tid bits of octopus. At least the outside was crunchy and there were some octopus inside..\n\nmochi ice cream: we got red bean and strawberry. The menu only said they had vanilla and strawberry so I picked strawberry. Bf got red bean and I was like "they have red bean???". Table next to ours ordered a green tea one and again I was "???" But I stuck to my choice. They came out like flat disks lmao. And the mochi had some ice crystals and was not very elastic and chewy. As the ending to my meal, totally disappointed and would probably have gotten better mochi aisu from a grocery store but hey, it\'s ayce.\n---\nServer was nice and checked up on us regularly. But service of food did take some time from time to time. Only once did the runner mistakenly bring one of our orders to the table next to ours but realized and brought it to us. They missed my one order of mackerel and I didn\'t bother to try to reorder it. And instead of getting the cucumber salad, they brought us seaweed salad which was still okay and we didn\'t bother to get it corrected either.\n\nOverall, we left kind of unsatisfied. The cuts of sushi were pretty small and thin compared to other earlier pics on yelp. Maybe it\'s hit or miss or based on the chef behind the counter? Quality wasn\'t that great either. Bf  agreed it wasn\'t how he used to like it. I honestly don\'t think I will be back..', 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2015-06-04', 'type': 'review'}

Each has its strengths and weakness and Goyemon is no different. The wait time on a busy night (usually every night) can be up to 45 minutes, but we got lucky and got seated right away on a Sunday evening. They state there's an hour limit (which seems ridiculous) for the AYCE portion of the menu, but I'm not sure how strictly that is enforced. \n\nStarting off with the nigiri, there's only two items that you are limited in ordering: the uni and the sweet shrimp. The uni was fresh and some of the best I've had in Vegas. My other favorites were the halibut (but variable, our second order was mediocre), fresh scallops, and salmon belly. You may also order the shrimp heads (deep fried) by request. This portion of the menu was definitely the best. \n\nMoving on, everything else was mediocre or subpar. The octopus and tuna poke was terrible. There was way too much seaweed and not enough flavor. The pork belly was actually decent and flavorful. The rolls were not very memorable, but they weren't bad either. The dessert was by far the most disappointing. The tempura ice cream was frozen solid and caked in soggy tempura batter. The red bean ice cream my friend ordered was completely melted, more soupy than an actual ice cream. However, I did enjoy the lychee sherbert and the black sesame mochi. \n\nCall ahead for estimated wait times and be sure to grab a stamp card for your 11th meal on the house!", 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2015-06-08', 'type': 'review'}

It had real chunks of mango!

A member of the Mon restaurant group (which also includes Monta and Sushi-Mon), this spot is generally regarded as their best effort and highest quality. \n\nUnfortunately, by the time I finally made a trip here, I was underwhelmed. Maybe my familiarity with their Sushi-Mon location on Sahara is to blame- their menus are virtually identical, with Goyemon offering additional items at dinner and some more unique specials. The quality of fish was good, but having a friendly relationship with a Sushi Mon chef garnered me the same product at their sister store. I really didn't see the upside to coming here instead.\n\nService during my recent visit was frustrating- server did not come around very often, food was came out slow and sporadic, and rice was falling apart on all rolls and nigiri. Not what I expect given the reputation that precedes this joint. They were busy, but not overwhelmed. \n\nI will say that the menu of rolls is extensive and their pricing is very fair ($22/lunch, $27/dinner). It's also nice that their last dinner seating is at 2AM. Better to visit for dinner than lunch, for increased menu options. But frankly I just found it good, not great.\n\nTLDR\nStandby items: superwhite tuna, garlic tuna, mackerel, and halibut nigiri; Lemon, Moon, Hurricane and Ecstasy rolls.

The fish was fresh and that's important as not all AYCE places serve the freshest fish. This is one of the very few gems that do but before you come here, be prepared to put your name on the list with your phone number so they can text you when your table is ready! It's pretty awesome. \n\nThe wait. Up to 2 hours if they're busy but I tell you what.. It's totally worth it. You can pretty much order anything and everything from the several menus plopped on the table. There's quite a few selections so look through them carefully. From appetizers to side dishes to the nigiri, rolls and desserts. It really is a true all encompassing AYCE experience where everything can be ordered. I did notice that the uni and amaebi nigiri can only be ordered once.\n\nMy favorite thing of all was actually not the sushi (that's not to say the sushi wasn't good) but the pork belly appetizer which was incredibly fattening, moist and insanely well flavored. If you like Salmon, the Salmon belly is available and sampled both the standard and the belly. If you like fatty and tasty fish, I wholeheartedly recommend the belly. It's got so much flavor! The uni was fresh and quite tasty.\n\nService was good and efficient. Being that it was me and my brother's first time there, we were kindly informed about the whole process. Our waiter was patient and answered all our questions and we had a few! By the end of the night, we were so full, we still opted for desserts. So yeah, try to pace yourself. Don't just order everything at once. Order in waves!\n\nWe came here during EDC week and this place was packed and with good reason. Service is good and so is the food.

He never answered when we would place an order... He either really didn't want to be there or he can't speak EngRish? \n-QUALITY went downhill... The fish was average at best. They were out of uni, quail egg and yuzu sorbet. The sweet shrimp smelled fishy and nothing was amazing. \n\nThe only positive of the meal was our awesome busser, Ariel.

Half of our order didn't show up so I had to re-order twice for everything.

This is one place where you should.\n\nLet me elaborate. You\'ll never experience top-of-the-line fish quality at Goyemon. You won\'t have the best uni, the most delectable tuna, or the sweetest shrimp. You might have to wait for an hour or more, especially if you bring a larger group. But you\'ll always be able to have as much reasonable-quality fish (and other tasty things) as you please for $26.95 (or $21.95 for lunch, but that\'s irrelevant - more info later). You\'ll always impress friends and family from out of town (disclaimer: yours may not be as cool as mine). Compared to Strip buffets, you\'ll get superior value, more-than-sufficient variety, and zero lining up in front of heat lamps. Yes, newbies: you place orders here like you would at a normal restaurant, and they cook and prep to order.\n\nAt Goyemon, choosing dinner (starts at 4pm) is an absolute must. If you don\'t go for dinner, you won\'t get grilled pork belly, multiple types of grilled fish (cajun salmon, super white, yellowtail, even salmon kama occasionally), the crowd-pleasing spicy tuna rice cracker, or the extra desserts that often include chocolate mousse, green tea creme brulee (I actually dislike this), yuzu sorbet, and extra mochi flavors. You\'ll also miss the uni - generally not "good" but at least passable, unlike some other places - and amaebi. I tried lunch once a few months back and was surprised that they do offer nigiri specials, but I missed my dinner exclusive so much.\n\nThe rotating nigiri specials are rarely or less reliably found at other AYCE places. Salmon belly is often available. Kanpachi (amberjack) is another nice option that I can\'t recall seeing elsewhere. Conch (rhymes with honk) is a surprisingly good too. Occasionally on holidays or perhaps at some manager\'s whim, they\'ll have blue fin tuna or even toro available as specials. They\'ve had a few anniversary or special items from time to time too with special pricing and expanded menu (invariably drawing huge crowds or rapidly filling time slots). These rare treats are always nice.\n\nI\'ll just list some other items that I almost always order: sashimi salad, baked green mussels (it\'s not overly sauced), super white tuna nigiri, fresh scallop ("hotate") nigiri, yellowtail nigiri, lychee sorbet, green tea ice cream (best texture and flavor I\'ve had at any sushi place). Also, the moon and hurricane rolls (usually half-orders).\n\nI congratulate and empathize with all the reviewers who have seemingly lucked into poor service. I may have had relatively slow service once or twice in the past, but it\'s been reliable the last few times and has left a good impression in long-term memory. If you\'re with a very small group, sit at the bar for likely improved sushi response times (the servers still cover appetizers/grilled items and drinks). And in general, don\'t sabotage yourself by under-ordering. I\'d say 7-12 items per order is a good range.\n\nAfter dozens of visits over the years, Goyemon is still consistently the best AYCE sushi place that I\'ve ever had the pleasure to enjoy. Others in town are close, and at least one has marginally superior fish quality, but I\'ll always bemoan a lack of dessert variety (if it\'s not one per person, which is a huge negative for those places), a lack of my favorite grilled items, a lack of a stamp card (buy 10 and get a free meal), or something else possibly nitpicky. This is the jewel of the surprisingly good AYCE sushi scene of the desert.', 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2015-07-08', 'type': 'review'}

They have a few waitresses that I don't see too often anymore (I'm assuming for good reasons) that will let our food die in the window and take forever to take our next order.  Like I said, it doesn't seem to be much of an issue anymore. \n\nOn busy evenings expect a party of two to have a one hour wait.  There are no reservations allowed.

EVERYTHING here was very high quality, and stood up to the most expensive and the freshest selections I have had at so many, many other "high end" sushi restaurants. The Latino guy behind the sushi bar did not stop smiling and offering me tidbits and Ohhh Sooo Good morsels of anything and everything --"Hey Sir, how you doing here, I have a small piece of Yellowtail Belly, wanna try some?, and \'Hey, you like Pork Belly too?\'.... it was non stop like that. Perfect Yellowtail, a nice dollop of Uni (only one order per person on the AYCE Menu, and I thought that was fair), Salmon Belly, Escarole (White Tuna, oh yeah they got \'em), FRESH Albacore.... I looked up a few times and met the eyes of the aforementioned Latino guy, and got more smiles, and more offers, until I started tugging on my belt and lamenting my recent small weight loss was just that, lost -- but wait, there\'s more!

The AYCE pricing is that of an average sushi restaurant ($21.95 Lunch; 26.85 Dinner) if you're into nigiri this is the spot for you. The freshness of the fish served here is much better than other sushi places here in Vegas.  I also like that most of the special rolls on the AYCE menu can be made in half orders, that way you can try out different rolls without filling your stomach. \n\nOne con would be the wait times. Expect to wait more than 30-45 minutes if you have a group of 3 or more and don't want to sit at the bar. Busy dinner times and the wait time could go up to an hour or 2. Luckily they can take your phone number down and you can get a text when your table is ready. One thing I wish they could do is take phone reservations because not many people would like to go there just to put in a reservation and have to wait a long time. But then again this place is very popular and has good sushi so it's worth the wait.\n\nI was hoping they'd take a 12 person reservation ahead of time for my birthday because I really wanted to enjoy some tasty sushi with friends. That didn't happen because we tried to call in and since they don't take any reservations through the phone there were no exceptions. Many times we had to go to another spot because we didn't want to wait an hour and a half and my group and I would leave disappointed. \n\nSo just be prepared when going here. If you're looking to have a quick meal with a group of people, plan ahead and maybe have someone put a name down that way your whole party doesn't have to wait.\n\nOther than that I still love to eat here and try it out !", 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2015-08-18', 'type': 'review'}

About the only thing that was decent was the miso soup and the uni which had a sweet taste to it.\n\nI even ordered a Hamachi hand roll but it only had Hamachi (a good amount) but there was nothing else. So where were  the veggies? Pickled Daikon - nope, slices of avocado - nope, slices of cucumber - nope.  Both of us commented on the very chewy seaweed used for the rolls and in fact at one point, I thought I was chewing a piece of saran wrap and spit it out.\n\nService was four stars by the servers who took our order for the miso soup and other non-sushi items but one star for the non-Asian sushi gen who was not engaging and in our opinion made some sub-standard rolls as well as lackluster nigiri which for some nigiri items should have had some sprinkled garnish on top of the fish.\n\nI should have done more research as I learned through googling afterwards that this location and Sushi Mon in Henderson are related.

The quality of the sushi here definitely beats those found in the international buffets at Caesars Palace or the Wynn. \n\nThe choice of raw fish is extensive, they have all the common sushi you can find at most sushi joints in the states, from salmon, tuna, albacore, white tuna, octopus, scallops, sweet shrimps and even Uni(sea urchin). The number of special rolls is off the charts. So many different types to choose from. Even the desserts like the tempura ice cream can be found here. \nWhy spend 50 dollars a person at a regular sushi joint if you are a hardcore sushi lover when you can spend half of that eating to your hearts content at this place? \nJust come earlier with an empty stomach and you will leave a happy and satisfied person.", 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2015-09-04', 'type': 'review'}

My boyfriend and I were happy to see that you can order the salmon belly as much as you want and same goes for most of the desserts on the specials. I also tried the grilled shishito pepper which was simple but delicious. Our go to rolls are usually the hurricane, the moon, the ecstasy, the jala jala, and the crispy rice roll. Try at least one of these rolls and I promise you won't be disappointed. Their nigiri is also very fresh and cut well, but I do feel like they could use less rice. Hands down, this place has the best dessert compared to all sushi spots I've been to in Vegas and I have been to quite a lot. I ordered eight desserts for my boyfriend and I but ended up eating most of it. I am a total fat girl trapped in a petite asian girl's body. I got the green tea creme br\xfbl\xe9e, two orders of sesame mochi, green tea mochi, two orders of tempura ice cream, lychee sherbet, and green tea ice cream. I do wish they would put more sugar on top of the creme br\xfbl\xe9e so it could have the thick, crispy layer of torched sugar that I'm used to. Other than that, you must try it. The tempura ice cream was alright, but I wish I would have ordered like 10 sesame mochi's because it was that damn good lol. They also have a yuzu sherbet that is one of my favorites from here but they ran out before I could get to it. This place is awesome.

I was so so so excited to come here as it was to be one of my top priorities in my trip to vegas the past weekend. But..\n\nWow. I was so disappointed. The amaebi here was what i was looking forward to the most and it was a big let down.  When our order came out, there was 4 pieces as we each ordered one. Each of 3 of them were a piece of shrimp cut in half and put on separate rice as if to make it look like one whole nigiri. I knew this because one of them had a full shrimp on it and the comparison next to the three miniscule pieces was extremely noticeable.\n\nIts an AYCE restaurant yet they limit certain items to one order per person only, which I do understand some items are more expensive but it really isn't AYCE if you think about it. And was precisely why it was more irritating because if I was able to get AYCE amaebi, I would've been fine with those pieces. But if we're getting only one time to order this, I expect it to be full pieces. It doesn't even have to be a fat piece of shrimp. It's just incredulous to me the fact that they shamelessly use half pieces and try to pass it off as if its meant to be.\n\nWhen I asked the server about it they brought it back to the kitchen saying they would fix it. Couple minutes later they bring out the same plate and it looked exactly the same. I didn't want to make a big deal and just decided forget it. Was thinking to myself they didn't change it, when the server comes over 5 minutes later to explain that they didn't change it because it's AYCE and the pieces are set already for AYCE and that if we were to order amaebi off the AYCE menu separately, the pieces would be bigger. Which made absolutely no sense to me.\n\nAll the other food we ordered was forgettable, and also a huge decrease in size and quality. Which was not the case 2 years ago or else I wouldn't have been dying to come back. Oh yeah, and the green tea creme brulee that was supposed to have a thin layer of burnt sugar covering the entire top of the custard had about a fingernail size worth of that. So you're basically just eating custard if you order that, not creme brulee.\n\nStep up your game goyemon, severely drowned my expectations.", 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2015-09-25', 'type': 'review'}

The rice here is quite similar to the rice you would find in a sushi roll bought from a grocery store. It's clammy, almost transparent, and almost brick-like in consistency. Simply put; it is awful. It kills all the rolls, and all the nigiri pieces. It's everywhere.\n\nThe rolls we did try were bland at best. The fish was 'meh'. I even ordered a 'sashimi salad', but it had 3-4 small pieces of tuna, and one GIANT ball of mayo-veggie mix, the thing they stuff inside California rolls. Clearly meant to fill you up for the all-you-can eat offer, it was almost disgusting to eat. \n\nThe best thing we had was the pork belly, which was delicious, and thus one star coming your way.\n\nOne thing: the air 'freshener' they use in the restrooms smells worse than the restrooms.

I mean, sometimes I'm just plain hungry and grab a platter of sushi from Trader Joes but I know what I'm getting for the price I'm paying. Now, this being Vegas and it being an AYCE place, I wasn't expecting superb and super fresh stuff. I was pretty sure I would've been better off ordering rolls but I had been watching an old Japanese drama of mine that focuses on nigiri so it's what I was craving. Anyhow, my impressions were...\n\n[--- Pros ---]\n- Pretty nice to have a sushi place only a short walk from my place\n- Pretty good price for AYCE (We went for lunch)\n- LOVE that the AYCE isn't limited to sushi but includes appetizers & desserts.\n- Baked mussels were pretty awesome.\n- Lychee sorbet with little lychee bits. Yep, my mouth went to there.\n- Miso wasn't overly salty which sadly so many places get wrong.\n- Tamagoyaki was a bit on the sweet side, which I love as I consider it to be my 'dessert' sushi. =)\n- Enjoyed the seared sake/salmon enough.\n- Food came pretty quick and servers were generally attentive.\n- Definitely ordered enough to justify the $22.\n\n[---Cons---]\n- Nigiri serving size. Now, as it is AYCE, I can kinda let this go as I'm sure they're just trying to make sure people are/can finish what they order, especially when it comes to the sushi but the nigiri were pretty itty bitty. Again, I probably should've gone with rolls over nigiri. \n- But even the appetizers came in pair servings. The baked mussels I can forgive but tempura? Gyoza? Eh...can throw me 3-4 pieces at least, especially for the actual size of them.\n- No inarizushi? =/ Isn't that a standard for a sushi place? And it's tofu pouches so it's not overly expensive to make so I don't know why they don't have it...\n- Also, futomaki is a 'special' 5 piece only roll? I would think it's more of a standard than a California roll, which is under 'Regular'. Sadly, by the time I noticed it, I was already pretty full. Oh well, next time.\n- Teriyaki sauce on unagi? Tsk tsk... Unagi = unaju\n\nAll in all, it's decent place to fill your belly on the cheap but I wouldn't recommend it for their nigiri unless its the tamagoyaki, then go wild! Definitely order some appetizers along with your sushi to get your monies worth in more protein than rice. Again, the mussels were delish. And save room for dessert. When I go back, definitely gonna try out the rolls... I figure that it's at least a step up from the sushi that's served at the buffets that's just sitting out there for who knows how long.", 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2015-11-18', 'type': 'review'}

You must go early, probably like when they open, to avoid a rush. I was discouraged to go somewhere else for ayce sushi based on the fantastic reviews. One of the review said they went somewhere else and regretted it so I didn't want to make the same mistake they did. But I guess it was a lose-lose situation. The server we had was great. We put in a massive order once we sat down because we had two hours to study the menu. The sushi itself was disappointing because their nigiri and rolls were small portioned and the fish wasn't fresh. You can find fresher fish at Sakura sushi east of the strip. It is not worth starving yourself to eat mediocre sushi. Don't do it, just say no and go.", 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2015-12-09', 'type': 'review'}

Waited about 10 min to be seated with my family of 3 total. We waited bc there were two tables about to be cleaned and since there wasn't anyone waiting ahead of us we thought we were next. The hostess didn't even mention a wait time. So after they cleaned those two tables the hostess goes outside to get people outside to come in. Wtf. I then ask her why how long is the wait? ONE HOUR! I have a hungry 4 yr old with me and you failed to mention this to me before....why? I understand, it's not your hungry family or self sitting there waiting for nothing.

It used to be my favorite ayce sushi place but it's gone down hill. last time we were here we noticed all the wait staff were new. They kept messing up our orders, didnt refill our drinks, and service was so slow. We stopped going for awhile and then decided to give them one more chance. Big mistake! This time we sat at the sushi bar and the sushi chefs were horrible. nobody acknowledged us for 10 minutes and then when we asked who our chef was, the one that kept looking at us but looked away quickly said he was. we then ordered and he gave us one plate every 15 minutes. after our 2nd plate we got full drinking our beer so we left without waiting for rest of our order. I wonder if it's new owners or if the owner knows how their place is going down. so sad.", 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2015-12-10', 'type': 'review'}

When our party of 8 sat, we waited for about 15 minutes before we got greeted for drinks. She came to the table without a hello or anything. She had no personality no enthusiasm and the only thing she had to say was that my 6 year old son can't eat the shrimp.  Please take Po to the back to mop the floors and clean the bathrooms or something.  She doesn't belong at the front of house.  She ruined Goyemon for me and now I'm gonna ruin Goyemon to anyone who asks me what sushi restaurant I suggest. \n\nBye Pa.", 'business_id': 'AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2015-12-19', 'type': 'review'}
