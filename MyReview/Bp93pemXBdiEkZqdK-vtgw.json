We ordered the gyoza as an appetizer and it was decent but not special. I ordered the #4 Spicy Crabmeat Roll and the #20 Roxy Roll. The Spicy Crabmeat was very underwhelming and I left half of it on the plate. A sushi chef messing up something as simple as a crabmeat roll is like a pastry chef messing up a batch of cookies.

Sushi 21 was just down Decatur and had a 4 star rating on here so we decided to try it.\n\nThis place is pretty good. The appetizers and rolls with AYCE are amongst the better places in town. The server we had was back very frequently to check on us and the sushi chefs were engaging. One of them even made me a half roll at the end of our meal even though they don\'t usually allow it when doing AYCE. \n\nThe only complaint that I had is when I ordered my first round of yellowtail, super white tuna, tuna, salmon, and unagi. It came out and looked very fresh but it smelled as if it were treated with something to preserve the fish. There was a slight taste of vinegar or something as well. I couldn\'t really place it. But the cuts were very generous and once past the "treated smell / taste" it had a good taste. I base my sushi experience pretty solely on the freshness / taste of the nigiri / sashimi so they\'re gonna take a hit on this one.\n\nOverall, a nice substitute for my fave sushi place in town when I was on a tight time schedule.

So I figured let's see if they're giving goyemon a run for their money.  HAHAHAHAHA not even close.\n\nTuesday night, 6 pm and there were 3 people in there, and no one else came in there the hour that I was there.  That's a BAAAAAD sign.  Typically tuesday is when sushi restaurants get their fresh fish and deliveries. If I recall, the fish markets are closed on mondays and there are no shipments.  So Tuesday & Wednesdays are the best days to go.  \n\nWithout even asking, they brought me edamame and miso soup.  I don't particularly care for when someone brings me something that I didn't order.  Their miso soup was lacking flavor and only had 2 spoonfulls, their edamame was fine.\n\nOn an all you can eat place, portions should be small-medium.  I ordered the sashimi salad and it was in a large bowl (toooo much) and the taste was just ok, it tasted like they put their garlic sauce that they put on their sushi rolls, onto their salad.  Maybe some people like this, but I sure didn't.\n\nTheir sushi rolls were avg. I saw lots of rolls on their menu that were based on california rolls and to me that is a sign of cheapness.  Another typical bad sign is when you can't order directly from the chef. They use the paper order forms and quite frankly I HATE the paper order forms.  \n\nI ordered 2 sushi rolls and they were just ok\n\nand then I ordered some nigiri and this sealed the deal that this place is bad...\n\nI ordered 2 hamachi and 1 super white (both were good)\nI ordered 1 order each of snow crab, uni and amaebi (sweet shrimp)  I didn't get any of those orders. The show crab was still frozen (I saw him put the large frozen block of it into the fridge behind the counter), and then he apologized they are out of uni and sweet shrimp.  Guess what folks...  Sushi mon and Goyemon are never out of it.\n\nand that leads me back to what I wrote above. Everything is usually fresh/delivered on tuesdays.  So where's your fish at????? \n\nSorry but for being 2 min up the street from goyemon (even if their servers are slow, the food is fantastic) I'm goin there instead", 'business_id': 'Bp93pemXBdiEkZqdK-vtgw', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2012-01-11', 'type': 'review'}

We told them again. another 10 minutes later, we had to tell them one more times that we want AYCE.

We gotten each order of sushi every 5 minutes.

We told her that we never got the rest of first round. She told us "just wait" and "it\'s coming". Ok....so we ordered a little more.\n\n10 minutes later, we got all of the second round(salmom, yellowtail, and eel for the second time), but still........ half of the first round was not here. \n\nMost of the first round items are the expensive items. Spider hand roll, sea urchin(uni), sweet shrimp , makerel (saba) and snow crab. \n\n10 minutes went by again, no first round. We asked and got the same answer.

Right off the bat talk about making great first impression with the specials. I like dam already have reason too come back again. \n\nTalk about small place not too many booths, the sushi bar has nice amount of seating (two nice widescreens that can watch sports; one got too be close too 50' right on the corner and another smaller widescreen slightly off the side) though, and of all things even have tiny koi pound (more like baby size ones or look like but YES actual fish in it) interesting. More in the back area they have a projection screen type playing music videos and feels little more like asian club cause can hear the music good in the restaurant. Lot of stuff going on comes too the decor for such small place. Honest I kind of fan breaks up the traditional sense of sushi restaurant. \n\nThe sushi ordered mostly nigiri that always given whenever I go AYCE style. I felt like ALL the fish I had was fresh, looked great, and tasted awesome. White Tuna, Hamachi, Albacore, Uni (not fresh; so took it for what is worth OK), scallops not what I expected or say am use too, Salmon, Cajon Albacore, and Unagi. My roommate birthday boy ordered two rolls tried both. Nothing wow factor so not remember what it was. I ordered spicy yellow tail hand roll. It was one of my favorite sushi the whole night. They don't really list hand roll on the menu more cut it up rolls. The sushi chef was great not problem at all. The only thing that feel like lack for five star is diversity comes too the menu. Unlike my only five star comes too sushi goyemon they offer more different cuts of fish, special menu with bunch of grill items, and diversity. \n\nThe service was fabulous! We were constantly being checked up on. Too drinks never even had chance too get half empty before asked if needed refill. The sushi chef was very friendly. Awesome! Nothing worst sitting at sushi bar the sushi chef stay all stuck up. Sushi 21 if want football (MNF style)  no worries about being packed getting your fill in. We sat front and center too the tv the whole game. Winnah! It always helps that not only is it so close too goyemon no worries about it being packed.

And it's sad you'd think you get better food in LA but this place has it done right!\n\nThere is also fusion of Korean delights such as galbi and bugolgi.\n\nThe decor of the place is very izakaya friendly.

Weeknights last orders by 1:30am, but I am sure they will stay open for you) The staff is attentive, the wait times are short, the tastes are plentiful, and THIS AYCE has 1 thing I hadn\'t seen at any other AYCE sushi BAR, sashimi and "dinner only" selections that make the extra $5 well worth it! The majority of like restaurants have 2-4 added "dinner-only" items. But 21 had well over a dozen. And all of them far outweigh the few added dollars that all these AYCE Sushi bars add anyway. \n   My "artist" was very accommodating! For example, I asked what the "chef\'s choice sashimi" was today, and his response was to ask ME what I wanted! While a "glass half empty" soul may call it lazy, my chef made it clear that his goal was for me to be happy. If you want an alteration on an existing item, tell them! Again, unique to this restaurant, you dont have to pass up on a roll that sounds great except for that ONE ingredient you\'re not fond of. (e.g. I am super-gringo & DON\'T do spicy at all, they exchanged spicy crab for regular crab without as much as a sigh)\n   The deep-fried oreo is not the same as Mermaids downtown, but is equally as good in its own way.\n  With 9 meals, you get a free meal (a punchcard tracks your visits) And with 5, you get a free birthday meal.

We\'ve eaten at many sushi restaurants in Reno and other cities BUT, we have never eaten at a sushi house this good. \nYes, you do get 10% off if you write a Yelp review but, they didn\'t check to make sure we wrote a review. It must be a service Yelp offers or the pop up coupon you get when you check in on Yelp wouldn\'t work. That\'s fine anyway, Yelp is one of the best ways to advertise and I would write a review one way or another.  \nThere are instructions on the AYCE menu so pay attention. There are certain items on the menu you can only order one of per person, but I\'m own a bookkeeping service and can tell you restaurants run on a pretty slim margin. You can\'t blame them for not wanting waste. Also, if you do not eat all of your meal you will be charged regular price for that roll. \n\nI\'ll try to keep this short even though I could go on for a while. We were a party of 5 and we were hungry!  We were looking for something close to the condo and Sushi 21 was there. \nWe were seated right away and ate easily over a dozen rolls and appetizers. We all agreed that every roll they brought was delicious. The edumami (sp) was hot, salted, and the freshest we\'ve had. Yes, I know it was most likely frozen from the supplier BUT, the difference was that it didn\'t taste like it had been sitting in the steamer all day.\nSecond, the service was amazing. Never once did empty dishes sit on the table for longer than it took us to put the dish aside and start eating another roll. We asked for fresh wasabi which was brought out in short order and it was delicious! \nThe oysters on the half shell were fresh but, could have used a little more in the way of accoutrements, like horseradish and lemon but, was served properly cut away from the shell and excellent with a spot of sriracha sauce. \nThe tempura battered anything was delicious. The tempura was light, crispy, tasty, and we could tell the oil used was fresh. We had one order each of the ahi tuna, which was thin sliced served two ways.  There\'s mayonnaise sauce on each style but, one was spicier than the other and both ways were delicious.\nHave I said "delicious" enough? No. \nThis is a little gem off the strip, away from the tourist traps and we are so happy to have found it.  If only it was in Reno! \nThe servers are friendly, QUICK and attentive.  We didn\'t have to wait long for anything. \nOne thing I can say for sure, the sushi houses in Reno need to step it up.  Every sushi house we\'ve eaten at, the tempura is either soggy, or tough, and tasteless and/or cooked in old oil. If the owners of Sushi 21 ever open a sushi house in Reno, we will have permanent reservations! This was the best sushi we have ever eaten.\nThis will be our first dinner stop next trip to Vegas! \nWhen in Las Vegas give Sushi 21 a try. I can\'t guarantee you will have as good of an experience as we had but, I\'m pretty sure you will enjoy your meal.', 'business_id': 'Bp93pemXBdiEkZqdK-vtgw', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2015-03-08', 'type': 'review'}

I cannot speak bad about Makino seeing as that was the 1st place my best friend took me to that got me started enjoying it.  I will never go back because raw fish sitting out cannot be healthy!  Having said that, some people question these AYCE Sushi joints for the same thing, and I have seen some things that were not good. But I see things wrapped that aren\'t being used, food kept at excellent temperatures, and nothing is ever left out!  I have walked out of another place and left my stamp card behind to tell them I would NOT be returning. As a cabbie who actually cares about my riders,  and who happens to be a "non-Strip" food fanatic,  and who happens to be rather large,  I like taking guests to food havens and looking at the faces of full and happy customers.  21 does it very well. The fact that it\'s not in Chinatown makes it an easier drive (J/K). You can also have sashimi   at dinner.  BTW if you need a driver that 1. Speaks English 2. Is 100% Honest 100% of the time.  3. Has a personality and is funny.  4. Knows a lot about this crazy town (history and food. I may not know ALL the clubs because they change almost weekly ) 5. My #1 concern is the safety of my customers.  Both on the road and in situations where people get ripped off.  Vegas is a fun place but some people target good people who may make drunken choices.

It was slow when I came in and they had already been sat service was prompt and the nigiri came out quickly as is to be expected of simple dishes. Rolls came out fast and were good the SWAT was my favorite since I\'m a shrimp lover. Our friends grabbed single menu items and we both did AYCE which was alright up until our friends had to leave. The server brought everyone\'s check even though we weren\'t finished eating which wasn\'t a big deal at all until our server started not coming to our table. We made eye contact with her multiple times and it still took her about 5 minutes to come by and check on us. She cleared our table as well without asking if we had wanted anything else (hadn\'t even ordered our last rolls or dessert yet). She ended up coming back after seating a table behind us at which point we were 1 of four tables with two servers in the restaurant. When she asked if we wanted dessert we were relieved and put in our final order. The deep fried Oreo was amazing as was the mango mochi really all the dessert was good (we got 2 of each). \nAll in all good service at first that had a sheer cliff drop off after our friends. Sushi came out quickly but the nigiri was covered in some type of brown vinegar stuff that made it rather "eh". Rolls and dessert were great. More attentive service throughout the whole experience would\'ve been nice instead of being placed into the "I\'m getting auto gratuity I don\'t need good service" category. 3 star nigiri, 5 star rolls and dessert, 3 star service.', 'business_id': 'Bp93pemXBdiEkZqdK-vtgw', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2015-05-23', 'type': 'review'}

While I was eating, there was a spider crawling around my table and freaked me out, making me lose my appetite. For appetizer, the Miso Soup is not too bad and the Golden Spoon is an interesting dish to try, but the Garden Salad was so tasteless and the greens weren't fresh. The raw sushi was decent in quality and freshness, my only critique is that the fish on nigiri was sliced too thin so it didn't satisfy me. The Ami Ebi (Sweet Shrimp) was actual really big in size compared to other restaurants and they at least serve Giant Clam, which many sushi restaurants having been serving lately. The Fresh Water Eel (Unagi) Nigiri was not made well, it was extremely cold when it's supposed to be warm, it was drenched in eel sauce, and there was a lot of rice. There were three people doing sushi at the bar and the sushi that came from the main chef was more impressive than the sushi made by the other two chefs who looked like young teenagers. At the end of my meal, I got to have Mochi Ice Cream which at least didn't disappoint me and actually satisfied my taste buds.

My boyfriend, his best friend, and I decided to check this place out after finding out the AYCE Chinese Buffet next door turned into a Dim Sum a la carte restaurant. The place was fairly cramped with the booths real close to your gut. It was almost like my man boobs were actually sitting on the table when we were done. We all decided to get the AYCE sushi dinner (1 hour time limit), which was fairly priced.\n\nThe service was fast and so was the sushi that came from the sushi bar for the first 15 rolls. Most of the flavors seemed to have originated from Korean style, Kim chee especially the ahi poke. 90% of the rolls that came to the table were drenched or overly sauced. When I go to a Japanese restaurant, I expect my sushi to come out fresh, with natural flavors. So all the sauces on these rolls today, is masking the low quality fish.\n\nThe last 5 orders depreciated the ratings of this place.  They should watch the quality of all their products, especially the "mini beef platter", the meat tasted past due. So guess who had the runs for the past day and a half? So I didn\'t know if the meat was actually meant to be on the fermented side, cause the whole Korean influence, or they were trying to sneak away with serving the meat til it was sold out so their food cost wouldn\'t be so high. There was a sushi roll that had corn and grilled onions on top of it, like who does that? With over powering, mayo based sauce drenching the rolls underneath, It would be awesome if all their rolls came with a description of what\'s inside or on top, My boyfriend is allergic to tomatoes, citrus, and onions. So then my ramen came out. I was thinking it would be a homemade ramen noodle, with a nice broth. Nope, top ramen, Kim chee flavored, with a sprig of green onion, dusted with more Kim chee seasoning!\n\nIf. It weren\'t for the e.coli infested beef tips, the drenched and soggy rolls, the mediocre tempura ice cream, and the southwestern, over kill on the onions on top of the sushi, or the imitation ramen, I\'d given this whole in the wall a higher rating!', 'business_id': 'Bp93pemXBdiEkZqdK-vtgw', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2015-06-08', 'type': 'review'}

They were out of a few of the drinks that I wanted to try so I had to "settle" for a bottle of soju.  The waiter, a little astonished by the severity of my alcohol tolerence, i guess, made hand gestures to demonstrate the size of the bottle.  Having played this game before, I quickly smiled and blushed like an anime character and threw up the thumbs up sign, with both hands. The waiter quickly understood and I thought that I heard him proudly tell another waiter as he walked away, " Errr, ohh thats a Meesta Amerika, Meesta Uuu Ess Aye!" But that might have been the soju talking or maybe racism.  \nAnyway, the nigiri, which is always my favorite was acceptable.  It came out fast and I did not have to wait.  I had almost everything and all seemed reasonably fresh.  I had to order the AYCE dinner to get the uni, and as always in vegas it is never orange; it\'s always a little on the brown side, but it was delicious.\nWhat really gives this place four stars, at least for me, was the amount of made up quasi japanese fusion shit that is on their menu.  I had a japanese burrito.  It is basically like a california roll wrapped in a tortilla and deep fried.  I also had a monkey ball, which was like pork and california roll ingredients, breaded, sauced and deep fried.  It was weirdly awesome.\nReally, the little things on their menu, like crawfish, golden spoon, dynamite, the above and all the other things makes their AYCE well worth it.  I tried sooooo many things and was quite pleased by the end of the meal.\n\n\nOh Wait!!!\nTempura Oreo!!!!!! \nYeah, I did it, the only down fall was the canned whip cream that accompanied it.  But still, I had a deep fried oreo.  Was it all that tasty?  Any tastier than a non deep fried oreo?  Not really.

And there are a ton of options. \nThe deal breaker however and probably the reason why my friends and I will not be visiting this restaurant anytime in the future is the service. \nOur first experience was very enjoyable our waiter was polite and attentive, but today when we went our waiter seemed distant and apathetic. When we attempted to make our second order, we had the all you can eat sushi, he informed us that last order time had past. He never informed us or warned us of a last order time. We wanted to end the meal with a bit of ice cream but were denied. The real problem came when it was time to pay. We were paying the bill half and half on two debit cards. He swiped one and said it declined. There was money in it we checked before and after leaving the restaurant. We just wanted to leave though so we paid full on the other card. It said decline again but this time we refused to believe him and asked to swipe again. The payment went through. \nHowever after that ordeal. \nWhen we later checked our bank statements. Both accounts had been charged half the total and one card charged a second time the full total.

I was in Vegas for a business trip and picked this AYCE (26.95 dinner) over another 2 in the area and I am SO glad I did! This place is so good that I felt compelled to start this review while I\'m still eating but probably won\'t finish since the food is that good. Haha. \n\nThe AYCE menu is pretty extensive and impressive.. With 45 appetizers, 27 nigiri selections, 15 classic rolls, 12 deep fried rolls, 52 special rolls, 9 baked rolls and some dessert options. \n\nWhat I ordered: \n\nNigiri; salmon, garlic tuna, white tuna, octopus, yum yum scallop. The nigiri here isn\'t buttery, melt-in-your-mouth goodness but for AYCE, it\'s definitely above average and I don\'t think you\'d complain. \n\nSashimi chef choice: it was salmon and same as above. \n\nOysters: so big and good! Only one order per person though. \n\nCrawfish: this dish is so yummy. It\'s a bunch of crawfish cooked in a delicious sauce. It is a bit greasy though and for a fellow fatty like me to say that means a lot because I love grease. It does have a kick which is great.  \n\nBaby octopus: they\'re actually pretty big for being "baby" and I liked them but without the sauce, they\'re kinda bland. \n\nSeaweed salad: a must at every sushi restaurant for me and this one was great! \n\nOrleans roll: OMG. This is the best sushi roll I have EVER had. I love cream cheese in my rolls. If you do too and you love salmon and spicy mayo, get this roll. The spicy mayo is actually spicy which is so awesome. This roll makes me want to move to Vegas. Okay that\'s me being dramatic but seriously, it\'s just really good okay? \n\nI got the strawberry, green tea and red bean ice cream for dessert and both were good! \n\nThe waitress that was working was such a sweetheart too. She was so nice that when she told me they ran out of uni today, I didn\'t even get upset and if you know me, I NEED my uni.

I came in by myself for a quick lunch and it was the worst experience. The waitress tells me right when I walk in that I made it in time for the all you can eat lunch special for $21.95. So I thought okay cool I'll go ahead and order a couple of things. First of all, it was slow. Nobody was in the restaurant but myself and yet it took 20 minutes for a sushi roll. On top of that, they messed up my order. I asked for a spicy tuna hand roll and instead of what I asked for, I got some crab roll. I brought this to their attention and instead of helping, they just brushed it off like no big deal. I asked for my check, that took another 10 minutes, mind you I'm still the only one in the restaurant, and when I finally got it, it was wrong. THEY WERE TRYING TO CHARGE ME FOR THE DINNER PRICE! I asked the waitress why is it that I was told it was still lunch and yet I'm getting charged for dinner. She said it was because it was 3:02 when she put the order in and lunch ended at 3. WHAT? She was the one that specifically told me it was still lunch time. She went to go see if her manager can excuse it and give me the lunch price and he said fine I'll give you the lunch price but we're going to charge you the hand roll you didn't touch. Um. You messed up MY order and then expect me to eat it all? I was infuriated. Worst experience ever. I'm never coming back to this sushi place. There are so many other sushi places close by that are better than this one, and they have better service.
