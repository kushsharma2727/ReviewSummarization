There is however a sweet consolation---264 miles away from my area,there is Noodles. Surprisingly, I would find my favorite chinese food place inside a vegas hotel. But it's true, the exceptional taste of the food here brought back memories of my Hong Kong love affair with congee, dimsum, peking duck and noodles. Unlike other places I tried, their roasted duck is tasty yet not as greasy (you can even order it de-boned which makes for an even more enjoyable pigout). Their dimsum is topnotch. Basic selections like har gao, siu maai, bau and ma chang taste exceptional. My most favorite of all though is their seafood congee. Not a lot of chinese restarants serve this well, if at all, but in Noodles, they have it great. It has savory stuff like squid, scallops, mushroom, bokchoy, fish fillets in a tasty base (not watered down or too textured).I do wish they'd expand the dismsum menu and serve woo kok (mashed taro with shiitake mushrooms, shrimp, pork), and bring back the seasoned jellyfish. Other than that, I have no complaints. If you do love chinese food, and you know chinese food by heart, this place won't disappoint. And for those of you who prefer other asian cuisine, like korean, japanese, vietnamese or thai, Noodles also has tasty selections to satisfy your cravings (eg. pad thai, pho, kimchi, udon, and other favorites). Not the cheapest place, but definitely worth it. Did I mention the ambiance? It's a casual, comfortable place with minimalist beautiful decor by Tony Chi. This is a must for those who love asian food and a good time.", 'business_id': 'E9ZsPtGovfEPHlMHkDdlQA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2006-10-11', 'type': 'review'}

There was quite a long wait on a Sunday afternoon, unless you were willing to sit in the smoking section (we weren't). When we finally got seated, we were impressed with the elegance of the table - nice, laquered wood and rolls on the benches for reclining. We were immediately brought fresh tea, and they never let the teapot get anywhere close to empty. We could have ordered off the menu, but we chose dim sum. Every single piece of dim sum was amazingly delicious and very high quality. We especially liked the chef's special that day, which was a steamed dumpling with abalone and crushed peanuts. Our big complaint was that the dim sum carts did not come by often enough. Understandable given that most people in the restaurant were eating off the menu, but we were very hungry and got very frustrated waiting for the carts. The frustration factor would have lowered this rating to 3 stars, but having recently had some very boring and uninspired dim sum recently at another place back home (the food was lacking, not the company!), I was reminded of how delicious the food was here in comparison. Except for the dim sum carts, the service was attentive. The price was not as cheap as what we'd pay back home, but hey, this is Vegas, plus we were a small group, which makes the dim sum cost go up when you split it up per person.

This meant things like the Signature Premiere Rice..\n\n...which was bland fried rice despite the bits of pineapples and raisins they stuck in there.\n\nThe Signature Chow Mein Mandarin Noodles with Barbeque Pork was surprisingly good, although the dish was a bit heavy on the onions. The noodles were thick and tasty.\n\nAnd the Yaki Udon with Chicken was just average, on the salty side, and heavy on the bell peppers, although I liked the texture of the noodles themselves.\n\nThe chicken slices were quite large in this dish.\n\nThese three dishes cost about 50 bucks and barely fed three adults and two young kids. When you\'re stuck in a Vegas casino and you\'ve got few options, a place like Noodles is a decent place to get overpriced food.

One table had edemame with pad thai noodles, another table got the typical "orange" fish and beef with broccoli, and a third had some strange noodle thing, why are white people so funny?....the point is this place actually has authentic food just a bit high in price but the flavors were all great, I will be back.', 'business_id': 'E9ZsPtGovfEPHlMHkDdlQA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2009-01-19', 'type': 'review'}

Despite being a casual dining place, the prices were fairly high, but typical for something in this hotel.  To be honest, I get much better Chinese food off the strip and felt robbed of my money when paying the check, but I'll explain that in a bit.\n\nFirst, we were in the Bellagio for something to eat, since I wanted Jean Philippe's afterward.  We walked toward the buffet and I was adamant on trying this restaurant because of the lovely decor and simple menu.  We were seated immediately at the back corner of the restaurant against the wall.  The part that irritated me was this grass skirt hanging decor that hung over our soy sauce and touched the table and I.  To top it off, it was extremely dusty and dust particles were falling slowly, like snow, onto the table.  I was shocked to see filthy decor on the wall.  Still, we ordered our food and we had to stick it out.\n\nThe shumai and chicken satay appetizers came out first.  Both were okay but nothing to rave about.  Although it was packed with flavor, the shumai reminded me of mushy microwavable shumai from the grocery store.  I wasn't impressed at all.  As for the chicken satay, it was dry and the sauce wasn't flavorful for my taste.  It simply fell short.\n\nMy husband wanted the main courses to be outstanding, as did I, but alas--they were sad plates of Chinese food.  We ordered a chicken chow mein, soya chicken (skin on) and bbq pork fried rice.  All of it was blase.  I wasn't impressed with the flavors, textures, or presentation.  The fried rice was extremely dry and was fluffy, almost as if they used Uncle Ben's rice instead of regular rice to make the dish.  The chow mein was okay, but it was overpowered by salt for some reason.  As for the soya chicken, it was moist and tasted good enough to chew and swallow.\n\nAfter an 83 dollar check for what we ordered, I was upset at this place for charging those prices for meager Chinese food.  The service was prompt on drinks, but that was it.  Our server was also very pushy.  After ordering our first entree he was ready to leave.  \n\nAfter all that I wanted to stop at Beijing Noodle at Caesar's to get shumai and noodles, and then HK and Food Express for other chinese dishes to make me feel better about Chinese food.  It was sad, sad eats at this restaurant.  I hate being depressed over food so expensive.  I will never eat at this place again, although the food was edible.  It lacks luster and authenticity despite the 100's of asians working the kitchen and the floor.  Either someone dumbed down their taste or they believe dumbing down Chinese food appeals to the masses.  Either way, someone did something very wrong at this place, and it will kill them in the long run.\n\nSteer clear of Noodles.  I'm thankful it's in a corner that most people don't walk by because it doesn't deserve an audience.", 'business_id': 'E9ZsPtGovfEPHlMHkDdlQA', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2010-05-13', 'type': 'review'}

I broke out my trusty iPhone and yelp app, and narrowed it down to Noodles (the restaurant), which was closest to my current location.\n\nNoodles is right off the Casino in The Bellagio, but has neither that crowded casino feel, nor that high end, 'I am going to get fleeced' feel.  Pleasant contemporary decor, with a lot wood, and a not-too-crowded-or-noisy atmosphere made me feel immediately comfortable.  The Dim Sum cart was making rounds, so I tasted a few basic dumplings, all pretty solid.  Followed that up with a bowl of wonton noodle soup.  It was served piping hot, and the dumplings were tasty.  Overall, it was pretty good, although the broth was not incredibly flavorful.  It went down quite well with the Asahi Super Dry beer.\n\nAll in all, I was pretty satisfied...just what the doctor ordered.  It was mildly expensive for a quick lunch, but the service was great, and it hit the spot.  Other dishes I saw coming out looked delicious, and were huge portions.  So much so that the girls sitting next to me at the sushi-bar style counter offered to share some of their food, but I was already stuffed by then.\n\nI would definitely go back, and probably would have rated 3.5 stars if Yelp allowed that, but they just don't quite rank a 4 star rating.

He loved the baked BBQ buns with sweet crust and almond fried shrimp ball especially.\n\nIt\'s located in Bellagio. So it was crowded with Asian tourists. The staffs spoke Cantonese.

Side orders like preserved duck egg, starting at $3 each. My take? They are all 2-3 times the price of regular restaurants in Las Vegas. You can read my "tasty" reviews on other Las Vegas restaurants too.\n\nSo, here\'s the breakdown:\nService: 4 (they were all eager to help, from push cart servers to our server Denny; very efficient and friendly)\nPu-er tea with chrysanthemum: 3 (good, $2 each person)\nSiu Mai: 2.5 (not the best cut of meat here... too chewy with fatty meat; or not minced with the right cut of meat)\nBBQ bun: 3 (2 per plate; small size; it\'s BBQ pork pun, my friend had to order 2 plates to satisfy)\nShanghai Dumpling: 0.5 (3 little one on tiny aluminum shell; $6.95 for 3; minimal juice inside; I could tell it tasted like Shanghai dumpling).\nChicken feet: 3 (Well done, easy to suck off the bone; a bit too sweet... my friend commented that they didn\'t have to alter the "taste" because most Caucasians won\'t even look at it; server brought it to me from the kitchen and not on the cart).\nEgg tart: 3.5 (crispy shell)\nPrice: 1 ($3.95, $3.95; $4.25; $4.95; $5.95...)\n\nSo diners, you\'ve got an easy choice.

The first time was at 12am and I was super tired but hadn't had a late night eat in a long time so was really excited about it.  Waited a few minutes for a table and got seated relatively quickly.  We have heard how great this place is, how their beef stew noodle is great, and etc.  So we ended up eating and my dad had Taiwanese beef stew and my mom had the won ton soup.  Both agreed it was good and portions were generous.  The gf had congee which was average and I had the hainan chicken rice which was disappointing.  Rice was dry, chicken just didn't look fresh, and then I thought to myself why did I order rice in a place that is named noodles?  Man I really missed out on that one.\n\nSo the next night after happy hour, we came back again.  And honestly speaking this place is probably the least expensive place you'll find in Bellagio.  We ordered noodles, fried rice, greens, roti naan bread, century egg, cucumber salad, and bbq pork/chicken.  Why did we order the chicken after seeing how it was last night?  No idea but even though it was a different kind of chicken it wasn't a winner winner.  The bbq pork was much better than the chicken and better than a lot of places in SF.  The fried rice, eh, it was okay, not great but not bad.  The roti naan bread passed, the century egg was okay (not a big fan), and the cucumber salad was too sweet.  The greens and the noodles (see?) were the winners.  \n\nWe actually ate a lot as the portions are generous.  Would I come back?  Even though I'm giving it three stars, I enjoyed the restaurant very much.  Service was great, decor is nice, maybe I was just happy eating out late with my parents like when I was young but I would come back because for a five star hotel restaurant the pricing isn't that bad.", 'business_id': 'E9ZsPtGovfEPHlMHkDdlQA', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2011-03-01', 'type': 'review'}

These anxious people know a secret: Noodles is home to the best authentic wonton-mein soup outside of Hong Kong and Toronto.  I have been to this Chinese-American-operated restaurant approximately 12 times in the last 5 years; and, its quality has not degraded since my inauguration.  The broth of its wonton-mein is delicate (not salty) and its fresh thin egg noodle is firm with the perfect starch-egg ratio taste that melts away in your mouth.  \n\nTo complement this dish, I recommend their quarter roasted duck.  While it is on the expensive side, their tender dark meat selection is usually outstanding and beautifully cooked, leaving a nice crispy skin.  The duck comes with their bone neatly trimmed off; however, you can request for the bones should you want to extract some its flavors by dipping its caramelized seasoning into your soup as some people do.  \n\nThe other selections on Noodles' extensive menu are very good but not spectacular save for the delicious oxtail soup.  Though the dim sum here is usually excellent, especially the gorgeous Shanghai dumpling and the siu mai, there have been two occasions where these selections have failed me.  \n\nThe service here is usually quick and fast like most Chinese restaurants in New York, San Francisco Bay Area, Toronto, or LA.  The wait staff is straight-forward and no-nonsense; and, the hosts are friendly and efficient even when the line is 10 parties deep.  \n\nAs mentioned by another reviewer, I would not order any beverages here other than tea.  The sodas do not come with refills.  I personally recommend their Jasmine Pearl tea, which comes in a porcelain pot.\n\nBut, no matter what you order, you must try what many people love about this restaurant: the wonton-mein soup.", 'business_id': 'E9ZsPtGovfEPHlMHkDdlQA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2011-03-26', 'type': 'review'}

Although it wasn\'t as authentic as the laksa noodle dishes I had in Malaysia, Noodles\' version is pretty good.  Of course the price ($18) is a bit steep for a bowl of noodles, but it\'s to be expected since it\'s located inside the lovely Bellagio (see pic).\n\nMy friends ordered the Vietnamese Seafood Pho (just ok, not authentic enough) and the Mandarin Beef Stew Noodle (nice hearty flavor).  \n\nI would eat here again if I was too lazy to catch a cab to the plethora of Asian restaurants located on Spring Mountain Road (off the strip).', 'business_id': 'E9ZsPtGovfEPHlMHkDdlQA', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2011-06-08', 'type': 'review'}

We had a large party (10 people) and waited for an hour and a half as other groups were seated before us.  After waiting this long, the staff finally thinks to offer to split our group.  (Really?! You just sat about 5 parties in front of ours, and from what I saw of the restaurant, you probably could not have found seating for our entire group anyway---so what took so long?)\n\nMy now shrunken group of 6 finally gets seated, and the waiter takes 15-20 minutes to come over and take our orders.  (BTW, what restaurant does not offer a side of veggies?  The only veggie offered separately on the menu was edamame, for $7!)  \n\nWhen the food finally rolls out (slowly), the orders are completely wrong.  \n\nI ordered the Beef Brisket Stew Noodles.  What I got was oxtails with noodles and bok choy.  One of my fellow dinner companions ordered the beef brisket fried rice.  She also got oxtails with fried rice.  We tried to talk to the waiter and he raised his voice to tell us that it was brisket (we simply asked what kind of meat it was) and then ran off.  We flagged down a waitress that was bringing water and asked her and she said "london broil".  I\'m sorry, but there is no way that I am mistaking oxtails for brisket (I am from TX, I know my cuts of cow) or london broil.  (Presuming that either myself or the waitress were correct, what was in my bowl is not what I ordered.)  My friend absolutely refuses to eat her food, as she doesn\'t mind eating ox, but just doesn\'t want to eat the tail.  I nibble at my food (mom used to make oxtail stew at least once a month when I was a kid, so I\'m familiar) but I am not pleased.  Brisket/ London Broil does not look like medallions of meat connected by ligaments.  The meat was tender, and there were no bones, but I was reconstructing oxtails (minus the bone) on a plate on the side by the end of the meal.\n\n Another one of our group ordered chicken chow mein.  Her meal did not arrive for 20-30 minutes after everyone else got their food, and only came out after we flagged the waitstaff down multiple times to ask about her meal.  \n\n My friend\'s mom ordered Soya Chicken with the chow mein noodles.  She got poached chicken (there was no way that chicken was marinated in soy sauce-- we all know what boiled chicken looks like!) and the wrong noodles.  When she asked the waiter about it, he insisted that it was soya chicken and argued with her about the noodles.  \n\nShe had also ordered combination fried rice with bbq pork and chicken, only to receive rice with beef and shrimp.  She decided not to argue or ask the waiter about it because we had so many things wrong with our table\'s meals and no one even tried to correct it.\n\nOk, so I\'m not one of those "the customer\'s always right" people when I go out, but for a restaurant in the Bellagio, I expected way better service.  If you are out of brisket, tell us.  Don\'t lie and say it is something that it is not.  Don\'t argue with your customers about what they ordered when you bring what is clearly the wrong thing.  This was a horrible dining experience, and I\'d never repeat it again. \n\nIn Summary:\nOverpriced. Limited Options. Rude Waitstaff.  Unwillingness to correct errors even when confronted, to the point where the servers are lying about what is on the plate.', 'business_id': 'E9ZsPtGovfEPHlMHkDdlQA', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2011-07-15', 'type': 'review'}

It tasted as good as actually being in Asia.\n\n- Char Siu Pau, Steamed bbq pork buns, the kind that has the puffy white breading. It was great. Moist (as it should have been as it was steamed).\n\n- Malaysian-Style Roti Prata, It is a pan fried flaky bread. Was really good and came with a better than reasonable curry sauce. Perhaps I was caught up in the moment. \n\n- Roasted Pork, Was awesome....the name of the dish defines itself. prepared well. not too fatty though enough to keep it authentic. \n\nProbably one of the few meals that didn\'t include alcohol...instead we had THAI ICE TEA!!!!! I found out it was on the menu and ordered one to complete the memories from Asia...and then after I got mine everyone else got one following my "tastegasm".\n\nTowards the end of our meal my friend saw that legendary Poker Player Johnny Chan was eating a few tables away from us. He was apparently the Bellagio\'s resident poker player. \n\nI will make a stop here again next time I am in town.', 'business_id': 'E9ZsPtGovfEPHlMHkDdlQA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2011-09-07', 'type': 'review'}

I won\'t lie, my mom tells me the same thing.  Anyhow, with that state of mind; he started his search for a place to eat, which he had never tried.  Alas, Yelp led him to a place called Noodles in the Bellagio.  Looking for a place to eat noodles... what better place to go than a restaurant called Noodles!?  Blah!!!!!\n\nPros:  \n  * Very Beautiful Atmosphere\n  * located inside Bellagio (fancy schmancy)\n  * spacious seating w/ large family style tables\n  * diverse selection of noodles from pho to singapore noodles\n  * large portions\n  *  The sauce that came w/ the calamari had a nice kick to it.\n  * Hor Fun was Yum Yum.\nCons:\n  * I haven\'t been to Bellagio on a Saturday in awhile, but let me tell you... Parking sucks!  No exaggeration, I was looking for parking for 45 minutes.\n  *  Way over-priced, but this was expected for a fancy restaurant.\n  *  The quality of the food sucked.  I\'ll talk more about that later\n  *  The wait to get in the restaurant was almost an hour.\n  *  After getting seated, it took the server 25 minutes before saying hi\n  *  Took nearly 10 minutes for water\n  *  Server forgot to bring my friends soda (she had to ask 2 times)\n  *  My tea took another 10 minutes to bring\n\nOrdered:\n  Calamari - I\'m a big fan of calamari, but this was chewy in a bad way.\n  Hot Tea - nearly $9, but it does serve 4 so it\'s not too bad\n  Singapore Noodles - definitely not what i expected, big portion though\n  Ice Water- if you want water, get it w/ lemon to mask that "tap" taste\n  Total cost:  nearly $40.00 !\n\nVerdict:\n  *  I wouldn\'t recommend this place.  I have no intention of coming back.  I do love that the portions were heaping, but I didn\'t really enjoy it much (at least not the Singapore Noodles).  My best friend ordered the Duck.  It was crispy on the outside, but the meat itself was a bit dry.  My friend\'s girlfriend ordered the Hor Fun.  This was pretty good.  If I had to come again, I\'d definitely would order this.  I expected it to cost me what it did, but for that price, I was disappointed with the quality of the food (maybe I just didn\'t order the right stuff.  I\'ll give them the benefit of the doubt) and definitely was not satisfied with the service.  Eek!  Me thinks not !\n\nTips:\n  * go to Chinatown off Spring Mountain... there\'s plenty of selection for a quarter of the price.\n  * you know how some place have water that has that weird taste, yea... Noodles has that type of water so get a hot tea or soda.\n  *  Hor Fun was Fun indeed.

Unless they are trying to give you a really authentic experience of an Asian restaurant, which includes horrible service, then I get it.

On our first visit I ordered the mandarin beef noodle soup.

Some may argue that this is common in beef noodle soup, but being from Taiwan (a place where beef noodle soup is extremely popular) I'm not a huge fan of this type of soup. All-in-all I still enjoyed the dish, the beef chunks and tendons were nice.\n\nThe seafood pho my mom ordered was also plain, although my mom liked it. \n\nOn our second visit I had the Dan Dan noodles while my mother ordered the Hainanese chicken rice and a side of Shu Mai. While I'm not an expert at either of the main dishes, I quite enjoyed the Dan Dan noodles; they reminded me of tasty dry noodles with sauce that I used to have as a kid living in Taipei. I would have preferred if there was more soup; the noodles were really taking up the small bowl and sucking up most of the soup.\n\n The chicken rice, on the other hand was not so good. The rice itself was dry, and everything else about the dish was mediocre. The Shu Mai were dry and average-tasting as well.\n\nStill, Noodles isn't all that bad for a quick bite of Asian food; it gets the job done.\n\nTaking into consideration that the type of food Noodles serves is - to my knowledge - quite rare in Vegas, it might deserve a 3.5.", 'business_id': 'E9ZsPtGovfEPHlMHkDdlQA', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2012-03-29', 'type': 'review'}

The service, the price, and the food.  The 2 star service was mostly how we ordered a Diet Coke and a Coke and we got two Diet Cokes and how they brought out a noodle soup dish first and then the other three fried noodle dishes about 10-15 minutes later.  The price was a bit much for what you get, although it wasn't unexpected in Vegas, let alone the Bellagio.  But seriously, it's noodles.  The dish probably costs $2 to make and is usually marked up to $6 or $8 at a normal restaurant....but $15 or $20 here?  Pffffft.  That's what I have to say about that.  The 2 stars for food is for the upset stomach about 20 minutes after leaving.  \n\nThe 4 stars were for the service and the food.  The service was great because no matter how fast I drank my drink, it was rarely empty and when it was, it didn't stay empty for long.  I got the spicy dan dan noodles which turned out to be pretty tasty.  The ground pork could have been any cut and didn't have much flavor.  The spiciness was on the very low side so I had to add a lot of the chili sauce they have on the table.  I got to try some of the fried noodle dishes and they seemed pretty similar to each other.  But the flat Thai-style noodles were pretty tasty. \n\nOverall, this restaurant is just okay.  It's the budget Bellagio meal and it honestly doesn't feel like it belongs in the casino.  I think that was because the ingredients are cheap to begin with and the menu was mostly stocked with the standard Asian dishes you can find anywhere else in the country.  There were some interesting things, I'll admit, but for the most part I've seen it all before.  This sentiment would probably be different if they had something like chicken feet in the dim sum menu, but alas.  If you don't want to spend a lot for food, I'd suggest walking somewhere else, you'll get more bang for your buck.

My husband and I polished off 4 plates of this alone. Piles of bones on our plates laid testament to our enjoyment. The manager noted how much of it we\'d polished off and mentioned "It\'s very unusual for Caucasians to try chicken feet." we smiled and said we were from NYC, and then he said "Ahhhh!" with a big smile and nodded understanding that we weren\'t strangers to chicken feet ("phoenix claws"). \n\nOur next in the line of favorites was the pan-fried shrimp and chive dumplings.

A place that serves Chinese, Thailand, Vietnamese, Singapore, and Malaysian food, and turn them into a mouthful of MSG with a little hint of regret! \n-Actually that's all you have to know about this place, but if you're curious about my experience here then continue reading:\n\nSingapore's national dish is called Hainanese Chicken Rice, and since my girlfriend and her brother grew up there, it has become a craving to have this dish every once in a while (like how we crave for french fries every so often). Anyway we've visited several places that serve this dish all over Vegas and decided to try a more upscale restaurant on the strip instead of the cheap local places we usually go to.\n\nNoodles is located inside the Bellagio Casino, and as soon as we got there we saw a long line outside the restaurant, which I take as a good sign since people line up just to eat here.\n\nNow this is where everything turns into a disaster. The friendly waitress was showed us to our seats, took our order, even gave us hints on how they serve their dishes. she left and returned later with our appetizers. \n\nI ordered some Calamari, Chinese Sesame Balls and Roti Prata.\n\nThe Calamari was served with a sweet and chili sauce. The breading was nice and crunchy and the calamari was soft. It had a bit of curry taste and it was the only delicious thing we had that night.\n\nRoti Prata is a Malaysian dish, it's basically a flaky flat pastry that you dip into a curry sauce, and is actually one of my favorite apps (not here though). The pastry was not flaky, it was tough and chewy. The dip had too much Turmeric and tasted powdery.\n\nThe Chinese sesame balls tasted like Chinese sesame balls.. \n\nOur Waitress then returned with our main dishes; The Hainanese Chicken Rice and a Mandarin Beef Stew Noodle. (note: this is the last time we would see our waitress.)\n\nThe Hainanese Chicken Rice was served with  chicken stock soup,  chicken flavored rice (which was dry and bland), the boiled chicken (of course) and accompanied by the 3 sauces: the red chilli-garlic sauce, a ginger-garlic sauce, and instead of the thick black sauce they usually serve with it, they serve it with soy sauce....... why not be creative and serve it with oyster sauce? it's thick, it's black, and the flavor makes more sense than soy sauce you lazy chefs! \n\nI don't even want to talk about the Mandarin Beef Stew..... The noodles were old, the soup tasted like tap water infused with MSG which made my head hurt the rest of the night and left an itch on my tongue..  The beef was tough... \n\nWe didn't even bother for dessert..\n\nWhen It was time to pay, all three servers were just talking and laughing at the host table. We felt so ignored... They didn't even fill up any of our drinks to wash the filth we just ate.\n\nOur Dinner was $106", 'business_id': 'E9ZsPtGovfEPHlMHkDdlQA', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2013-01-10', 'type': 'review'}

Maybe a few enemies.\n\nI'm not sure how anyone can rate this place higher than 3 stars.\n\nI don't care if the place is in the Bellagio, the quality of the food and service are not at the level of the prices.\n\nNone of the food we had was any where near exceptional. \n\nPho for $17 is triple of what you should pay.  There wasn't anything fantastic about it, the same bowl that I could get in a neighborhood Pho shop.  Plus we had to ask for sriracha and hoisin sauce.\n\nThe Singapore noodle dish really lacked curry flavor.  In the neighborhood restaurant I visit at home is packed with flavor and is $8 less.  Oh, I forgot I'm in the Bellagio.\n\nService was fair, but after our food arrived, there was almost no attention given.\n\nHere's where the meal went really wrong.\n\nOne of the wait staff began clearing our table.  In her desire to get as many dishes off of our table as possible, she had way too many dishes in her hands.  She dropped one of the dishes on the floor and broke, with one of the pieces hitting me in the leg.  At first I thought, oh it hit me on the leg, no problem.  A few minutes later I felt liquid running down my leg, so I looked down and saw blood.\n\nI used my napkin to wipe it off and then called the waitress that dropped the plate.  She looked at it and was going to wipe it with a towel that she was using to wipe the tables with.  I pulled my foot back and asked that she bring me a clean cloth and bandages.\n\nShe said she would tell the manager.  We waited for about 5 minutes and no manager came.\n\nWe found the manager ourselves and let her know what happened.  She said no one told her about the incident.  She had security come talk to us to make sure I didn't need paramedics. I told him I wanted to report this as an incident to make sure management had a record of it.  I never asked for anything other than to have an incident report made.\n\nHe told me that he would talk to the manager and have her adjust our bill.\n\nWhat is really odd is most restaurants, when a customer is injured by the staff with blood, they will comp the entire bill.  She only took off half the amount and wasn't really apologetic.  Her attitude was more like I was an inconveniencing her and I should have moved my leg to avoid the dropping dish.\n\nIn summary, this place is way over price for mediocre food.  You can't blame the wait staff for poor service since they perform at the highest level of their manager.  And her low quality of service sets the bar really low for her team.\n\nOh yeah for the reviewers that said it had a great Asian ambiance, the decor reminded me of a casino cafe.  The only thing that made it seem like an Asian restaurant is the art work on the walls and the menu.\n\nStay away from this place!\n\n\nThis shows that they really have no care for the customer.", 'business_id': 'E9ZsPtGovfEPHlMHkDdlQA', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2013-08-29', 'type': 'review'}

Well, relatively cheaply. Eating at McD would be the truly cheap option, but I thought we were on vacation, were we not? The answer to eating relatively cheaply on the Vegas Strip is... wait for it (don\'t worry, I won\'t switch to commercial break on you. Please, I am not Gordon Ramsay)... Noodles at Bellagio.\n\nNoodles is an Cantonese restaurant located right off the Bellagio casino floor. Super duper convenient, if I do say so myself. Noodles specializes in Cantonese cuisine. Decor wise, Noodles was simple and humble, nothing extravagant in comparison to the other Bellagio restaurants. \n\nWe liked Noodles so much, we ate here twice during our short trip to Vegas. The first time was on a Sunday, where they went the traditional route and had Dim Sum cart service. This is when the restaurant makes a bunch of small plates, stack them on a cart and have a waiter/waitress push the cart around the restaurant floor, where patrons can flag down the cart and order a small plate directly from the cart. Even though this is the traditional way, I have never been a fan. You can only choose what\'s on the cart and it\'s often served luke warm. Okay, I\'ll stop my complaining now. Moving on, we had the pan fried shrimp & chive dumplings and fried radish cake. Both were luke warm (of course they were! this method is flawed). The pan fried shrimp & chive dumplings had great flavours, despite being slightly oily. The radish cake was not the best I have had.\n\nWe also shared the Wonton Noodle and the Roasted Duck Rice. What I loved about the Wonton Noodle is that the wonton fillings were all shrimp, giving each wonton a great springy bite and also making this a light dish. The Roasted Duck Rice was awesome. When I ordered it, the waitress asked me "with bone or boneless?" You can get boneless roasted duck on rice? This is brand new information to me. I was impressed. Cantonese style BBQ duck served on rice is a pretty common dish and being a BBQ-duck-lover, I have had it many times from various restaurants. I have never been offered the option of going boneless before. I can finally, for the first time in my life, eat roasted duck on rice like a proper lady with no need to wrestle the meat off the bone with my teeth and channelling my inner animal self while gnawing on the bone. I do paint a vivid image, don\'t I? ;) The duck was delicious, nice and fatty, just how I like it. I ordered it again on our second visit.\n\nI highly recommend this restaurant, especially if you are spending your day gambling at the Bellagio casino floor. ;) I recommend saving this restaurant for a weekday lunch, because I think Noodles and The Buffet are the only restaurants open for lunch service at the Bellagio on a weekday.\n\nPlease visit my blog, where I documented my recent trip to Las Vegas. I have food photos!

You know that restaurant that stays open all night, after the real restaurants have closed, to feed the late night crowd.  It usually has a little of everything, but nothing that stands out.

A variety of random Asian dishes, some better than others, but nothing that stands out or that you'd want to go back for.  \n\nI had the double happiness with BBQ pork and roast duck.  It's a dish with all meat, so I ordered a small bowl of rice on the side.  If you get the fried rice with duck, it's 90% rice, 10% duck.  The dish was $22.50 and while overpriced, still the best plate on the table.  Both meats were tender and flavorful.  You could easily order this dish and share among 2 people.  Well worth it.  \n\nMy hb got the laksa curry noodle.  It was a decent sized bowl, was steaming hot, but a bit on the fishy side for me.  More fishy, less curry.  Not my favorite.  \n\nOur friend got the braised beef brisket rice.  He said it was good, but not great.  It was more of a meal for one as opposed to a dish to share, so plan accordingly.  \n\nWe also tried the tempura shrimp and at $12.75 came with 4 pieces.  They were decent sized, and done well, but easily something you could get anywhere else.  \n\nService was just ok.  It seemed there were many servers, but a lot of waiting around.  We weren't in a hurry, so we weren't bothered by it, but I did see a server straight up eating behind the counter, then with food still in her mouth and chewing, she picked up a few dishes and served them.

I guess being Asian, you have a bit of a higher standard for noodle dishes, but as non-biased as I am trying to be, the food here was below average.\n\nThe worst part came AFTER we left Noodles. One of my friends had an allergic reaction to the food (she ordered the pad thai) after we left. She had trouble breathing and broke out in hives everywhere until she took some Benadryl to alleviate the reaction. She is allergic to nuts, not peanuts (peanuts are legumes, not nuts!), so we assumed there may have been other nuts in the pad thai they might have not listed on the menu. We called the restaurant to let them know of this and after talking to several (at least 3) people at the restaurant, they repeatedly just read the menu to us and said she might\'ve had a reaction to the peanuts. Like I said...she is not allergic to peanuts and orders pad thai all the time. There were probably other products in the food that were processed in a place with nuts, we assumed. We talked to the manager and he was very apologetic over the phone, got our information down (what hotel we were staying at, what room, how bad the reaction was, etc.), and insisted that he send someone up to our hotel room to check on my friend. She was feeling a little better (able to breathe, thank God), but we agreed to the person coming up to check on her just to make sure she was okay. We waited quite a while in the hotel room...no one came up. The manager ended the phone call with "Sorry about that, hope you feel better." ...thanks, NOODLES.\n\nOverall experience: mediocre food and bad customer service (even before my friend got sick). And then they did not keep their promise of having someone come up to our hotel room at the Monte Carlo. Yes, my friend did feel better after taking Benadryl, but after getting our information down and extensive phone conversations with us regarding the situation, and all of us waiting in our room, you would think management would come through. We also e-mailed them after we left Vegas a couple days later about this, but no response. -_-\n\nGet it together, NOODLES!', 'business_id': 'E9ZsPtGovfEPHlMHkDdlQA', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2014-07-17', 'type': 'review'}

Our friend got a severe allergic reaction to something she ate and upon calling Noodles, we received one of the worst customer service.

It's wildly overpriced carbohydrates tucked into one of the world's most famous casinos. My shrimp dumpling soup was pretty good, with a fishiness in the broth that didn't wrankle my nose, which can be a hard feat with a diner who didn't eat much fish growing up. But you're paying a lot of money for a small bowl of noodles. The ambiance, like the rest of Vegas, covers up structural problems with a dazzling and dizzying array of exotic looking noodles in jars against the wall, almost as if a noodle crazed mad scientist had taken up residence in the restaurant. But the food was on the meager side, and expensive, evn given the quality. And we found the service to be wanting. I think they were short a waiter, but we had to call one over after waiting an unusual amount of time for someone to take a drink order. The food also took a long time, even though we arrived well after the typical dinner hour. Also, I wouldn't come here if a member of your party is a frequent visitor to bathrooms and has trouble walking. The bathrooms are on the other side of the casinos (of course), so you'll be trekking through slot machines and hordes of well dressed career professionals to get to the facilities. Unfortunately, while Vegas may have good food here and there, often there isn't a lot of choice once you're anchored in a casino. Each one has their pride and joy restaurants. For what it's worth, I'd either skip the noodle section of the menu here and hope for something better in, say, the Mappo dofu, or try the Cantonese restraurant across the way which may or may not be a better choice.", 'business_id': 'E9ZsPtGovfEPHlMHkDdlQA', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2014-11-16', 'type': 'review'}

If it has Asian noodles and broth ...I am in!  But not all noodles are created equal and Noodles in the Bellagio gets it right.\nFirst the service ....Some of the best of the week so far.  There was a line (always a good sign!) We stood in it for about 15 minutes but the hostess kept us up to date on how long about every three minutes. Really pro. We were seated in the comfortable surroundings of a top grade Asian noodle house. Once in our seats I could smell the aroma of wonderful broth and hear the familiar slurp sound that is a must in a noodle venue. We ordered appetizers. Easy choice was the chicken satay with an amazing peanut dipping sauce. Also sampled the shrimp tempura. So perfectly fried and tender beyond imagination. But the barometer of a noodle house is of course noodles in broth. I added the BBQ pork with egg noodles and the scrumptious bowl wafted out  the smell of the deliciousness to come. A perfectly cooked noodle with a fantastic broth were what i came for and received. I told my wife i could eat all my meals here this week. It was that good. I was pretty sure i picked the right place when I noticed the seventy five percent of the customers were Asian. Always a good sign! I usually rely on Yelp before trying a restaurant but i am glad I did not consult Yelp this time.

I asked our server if they could substitute the regular milk for soy milk. She told me no... Something about the tea having lots of sugar, plus the sugar in the soy milk... Just too much sugar. Um, what? That doesn\'t make any sense. It\'s easy to sub soy in any milk-based drink. I do it all the time. If the drink was pre-mixed with regular milk already, then I can understand. But you\'re telling me no bc you think I think it\'ll taste too sugary with soy? Soy doesn\'t typically have lots of sugar. It\'s a fine substitute. What if I like lots of sugar, anyhow? I don\'t. But the point is... It\'s my drink, personalized to my tastes, and the server doesn\'t know me... So let me order it how I want to. \n\nAfter losing that battle, we ordered our food. My dad got the Noodle Soup with Chicken and again, we got another wonderful recommendation from our server: "That\'s not my favorite. It\'s too light and not very good." Thanks? We know she meant well, but there may have been a bit of a language barrier (it sounded like she didn\'t know English very well.) Her recommendations were probably helpful in her eyes, but to us, they sounded discourteous. Luckily my family and I are laid back and we just laughed it off. \n\nFood: Dad got the Noodle Soup, as requested, and it was actually pretty good. A little bland, but not bad.

Unfortunately, Noodles left my hopes rather flaccid. \n\nI was expecting to pay considerably more than usual for Noodles and dim sum. Noodles is locate on the Strip and in the Bellagio so that is a given. The return would be that these noodles and dim sum would be some of the best in town. I would have been quite happy with this trade off...but it didn\'t happen that way. For dim sum we had the shrimp & pork Shui Mai steamed pork dumplings, shrimp Har Gau dumplings, and the Spareribs with Yam Cube. The dim sum was all good, but not significantly better than what you can find in town at a fraction of the price. For noodles we went with XO Crabmeat Vermicelli...a dish that sounded amazing: lump crab, egg, bean sprouts, cabbage, XO sauce with an option for mild or spicy. The crab was ample and tasted fine, but the dish completely lacked flavor. It was one of the most bland noodle dishes I remember eating. The XO sauce was virtually non-existent and literally consisted of minimal bits of caramelized sauce...so disappointing. The dish we ordered spicy, yet was not even mild. This was the most expensive of the wok-fried noodles and as I walked out I was looking at other tables wondering if any of their dishes had any real essence of flavor ...and wishing I had ordered something other than this "Signature" dish. My wife and I both started eating the noodles the way they were served.  1/3 of the way through we both added some of their spicy chili paste that brought the dish up to a mild level, but the essence of the dish still lacked flavor. On the side of our noodles we also had the roast duck. The duck was fine. It had a good flavor, but was not as good as other considerably cheaper options in town. We finished the duck, now 2/3 of the way done with our lackluster noodles, when my wife minimally redeemed the otherwise uninspiring noodles by adding the duck sauce/drippings to the remaining portion of the noodles. It wasn\'t as good as a true XO sauce would have been, but it was certainly better than the dreary noodles.\n\nIn theory I\'m the perfect local resident for a place like noodles. I want to pay more to get a better product. Too bad there wasn\'t anything to set them apart.\n\nA tourist would do just fine to come in for over-priced dim sum since any other immediate options are equally inflated in price. I would only come back with someone that personally could recommend a specific dish they thought was incredible. Regina C. has good things to say about their Mandarin Beef Stew Noodle.  Overall I was certainly disappointed...so much so that I\'m torn between 2 and 3 stars for Noodles. Some of the food was A-Ok, but in general I have experienced better at other Strip properties and even a mile away on Spring Mountain for a significantly smaller portion of the cost. Trying to take my expectations of a wonderful taste bud experience out of the equation I decided to go with 3 a generous 3 stars in the end.', 'business_id': 'E9ZsPtGovfEPHlMHkDdlQA', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2015-02-20', 'type': 'review'}

Everyone that knows me can attest to how much I love yummy chew springy noodles.  So a restaurant to the name I have to give a second chance.\n\n My review even based on the first time still remains unchanged. Let me start with a few good points if you find yourself in a late night Chinese food craving. This place has a good turn over (they need it cause it's tiny). Once seated after an initial wait the food comes very quickly and it's open late. One reason we stop here on a Sunday night.\n\nNow the major fault of Noodles is two things price and attention to detail. And these two work in conjunction. For a $20 dollar bowl of pho there should be a very high end sense of quality. Expectation of the what they served is hardly any different from any Chinese Asian restaurant for way less. \n\nService aside which is better than most Chinese restaurant but still can stand major improvement is there attention to their own food. Normally when you  serve Thai food you ask how spicy the customer enjoys it. I ordered a spicy Thai shrimp noodle and received something so spicy it was almost inedible. If I have been aware I would have avoided the heartburn but that was my mistake no thanks to the person taking our order. \n\nVenom aside this is a traditional Cantonese restaurant serving very basic Asian classics. If you don't mind the high prices and enjoy average wonton soup,fried rice ,pad Thai, congee, and dim sum yes you found it on the strip no doubt. \nAlternative is to find the china town in Vegas.\n\nLast little tip order food that is more Chinese in origin the Thai and Japanese selections are a bit out of their element.", 'business_id': 'E9ZsPtGovfEPHlMHkDdlQA', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2015-05-25', 'type': 'review'}

Staying at the Bellagio for a conference, didn't rent a car, it was already 3:30pm and I hadn't had lunch yet. So my options were pretty limited. That being said, I was pleasantly surprised by this adorable restaurant. All of the waiters and waitresses are Asian. I don't know why I was so surprised. Being that it is in the Bellagio I think I expected this place to be not very authentic. \n\nThe menu has food from every Asian country I could think of! Is this place Chinese food? Vietnamese food? Thai food? All of the above???\n\nLulu, my waitress was lovely and very attentive. Since they keep these casinos below freezing in the summer I opted for a hot tea, egg noodle soup with BBQ pork and a side of siu mai. The food came out fast, lucky me bc I was starving by then! The noodles had great texture and the broth was very tasty. The BBQ pork also had great flavor, although it was cut a bit thicker than I'm used to with my regular OC restaurants. I had a little difficulty biting it into smaller pieces. No biggie. The siu mai was very yummy as well (pretty standard). The check came out to $32. This is actually a very nice looking restaurant inside the Bellagio, so the price is to be expected. \n\nMaybe bc I was starving. Maybe bc I already had low expectations due to previous reviews. Maybe bc my palate isn't very sophisticated when it comes to Asian dishes. But in my humble opinion I thoroughly enjoyed my meal at Noodles. Lulu was so sweet it just made my experience that much better. \n\nUnrelated side note, the couple next to me (I will not disclose their ethnicity, but you can figure it out) order fried calamari and asked for cocktail sauce.

Upon being seated we were greeted by a female server that seemed very annoyed we were taking up her space.

The tables were so close together the lady to my right's phone conversation made it difficult to hear my fianc\xe9 ... and the call lasted the entire length of our meal. About the time the entree arrived (food: average at best) the servers decided to reposition every chair in the restaurant by sliding them over the tile floor instead of picking them up, creating an unbelievably loud screeching sound from every direction. This was also the time  the kitchen staff found it necessary to begin pounding on something that apparently needed a LOT of pounding ... Really loud pounding! The couple to our left finally had enough and called over the server to complain. The server listened then  disappeared to the kitchen ... and the noise continued until we'd almost finished. I was so annoyed and uptight all I could think of was getting out of there ... So we did ... But they weren't done with us ... My fianc\xe9 and I had stomach trouble for the next 24 hours. \n\nBottom line: Noodles is a great location ... for some other restaurant.\n\nUpdate: Let me be clear: The service culture and facility that is Bellagio (other than Noodles) was FLAWLESS during our stay. We ate at several restaurants that were excellent; visited bars, tables, etc. Noodles may be part of Bellagio but it was on another planet from the rest of our Bellagio experience.
