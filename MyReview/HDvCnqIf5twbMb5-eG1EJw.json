I just can't.  This place is hands-down the best breakfast place in the valley, and short of getting a $30 breakfast at a swanky resort, it isn't even close.   \n\nI'll start by saying that when you order coffee, they bring you REAL CREAM for it.   Do you know how long it's been since I've seen a breakfast place bring me real cream?  So long that I had to check to make sure it wasn't spoiled half & half.  It makes their already good coffee taste awesome.  \n\nNext, they have actual thick cut bacon, not the pre-packaged strips you'll find at Denny's..  I'm drooling just thinking about it.  \n\nEverything I've had off their griddle (french toast, belgian waffles, crepes) have been awesome.  If you get the chance and you're hankering something sweet, get their taffy apple french toast.  I think they put me in a sugar coma, but it's soooo good.  Tons of apples, caramel, pecans, other things I don't really remember cause I kinda blacked out.  Oddly enough, though I haven't had them myself, I've heard the pancakes were less than spectacular- crumbly and overdone was the description a friend gave  Strange for what would seem to be their signature dish.  I'll chalk it up to a one-time error.  \n\nAlso, can anyone explain why I find the need to order eggs for breakfast?  For some reason, it just doesn't feel like a breakfast meal unless there are eggs present, but I only ever eat like half of them.   I don't even really like them.  That's not really related to the review, just kinda throwing it out there.", 'business_id': 'HDvCnqIf5twbMb5-eG1EJw', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2007-09-28', 'type': 'review'}

I really liked the spinach scramble I ordered (I opted for the egg white sub), and the cheese grits I sampled were light and tasty.  The coffee was decent, although not up to that of, say, Breakfast Club (I believe they serve Illy) or even the private-label stuff at Wildflower.  (NB: The heavy cream served with the coffee was unnecessary.  Being a part-year Canadian, I think the best cream for coffee--if used at all--is the 18% mf coffee cream widely available in the Great North.  More flavorful than half-and-half, but not quite as sludgy as heavy cream.)\n\nNow for the bad points that made it a two-star breakfast for me.  First, the pancakes: I paid extra for two multigrain cakes instead of the buttermilk and was horrified when I bit into one.  It seemed undercooked in that it was soggy and tasted of raw flour.  Undeterred by the setback, I had my BFF dining companion give me one of her buttermilk pancakes.  Better, but still none of the slightly crunchy bite that epitomizes that golden "crust" of a perfect pancake.  Being a throwaway starch side to the meal, I would have let the gross pancakes slide, but for God\'s sake, this place bills itself as a "pancake house."\n\n(Incidentally, if you\'re thinking there\'s no such thing as a tasty multigrain pancake, try the protein cakes U.S. Egg serves up.  The PCC Men\'s Grill will also whip up delicious ones to order.)\n\nSecond strike: Butterfield\'s "maple syrup."  I\'ve had plenty of maple syrup of all grades (interestingly, the cheaper/lower the quality of maple syrup, the stronger the maple flavor), and the stuff they put in their private-label bottles is the oddest-tasting maple syrup I\'ve ever sampled.  If, however, you are a fan of ersatz syrups like Mrs. Butterworth\'s, by all means, stock up: customers can buy Butterfield\'s syrup to take home.\n\nI end my review on a lighter note: those of you who know me also are familiar with my occasional lapses into East Coast snobbery when I ridicule the Midwest. (Four years in Chicago for college: I think I paid my dues.)  My friend Kerry, a proud Michiganian, always sticks up for her regional plot during these times.  Sitting at this restaurant, which apparently hails from the Chicagoland area, she mumbled, "I hate to say this . . . I *really* hate to say this . . . but this place is so Midwestern.  Ugh."  Hearing this pejorative remark brightened me up and almost made up for the subpar pancakes.  Almost.', 'business_id': 'HDvCnqIf5twbMb5-eG1EJw', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2007-09-30', 'type': 'review'}

They have their own bottled syrup and their moto is "Where breakfast is an all day affair." As it should be of course. \n\nThey have a great menu of stuff. Some great pancakes, baked dutch and apple pancakes and some really creative french toasts. And that is just the beginning. There are egg dishes to no end. We ordered the baby apple pancake (baked, it takes 30 minutes) and an omelet (that comes with pancakes and hash browns). Everything was GREAT. If you have never had a baked dutch apple pancake, you should check it out!!!!! There are probably 3-4 apples in this thing and pretty much guaranteed that you will not eat it in one sitting, unless you share it. I had it for two days in a row (the same one, half each day). MMMMMMM!!! It was just great. The omelet was very good as well. My boyfriend ordered the bacon, avocado and cheese omelet.

Lights hanging from waffles complete with a pad of butter. You can\'t beat it.\nThe menu was full of yummy things... I have a list of what I want to get on future visits.

I didn\'t feel so bad since I had noticed the "pancakes made with whole grain flour" on the menu. Awesome.\nYeah, the whole breakfast was $7.50. And then OJ- they have a machine that squeezes the oranges right in front of you. It\'s on the back wall and you watch them throw in oranges and see the delicious nectar drip right into the pitcher that fills your glass (fills, but probably not refills).\nNext time I\'ll try the Baby Apple baked pancakes... or the Lemon Poppy seed french toast with blueberry compote... or maybe one of the fantastic looking skillets... or maybe...\n\nUpdate:\nI tried the Baby Apple pancake. Wow. It was totally worth the wait. The pancake is big enough for two. It was thick with gooey apple goodness and warm cinnamon yummiliciousness.\n\nPS\nI have added this to my Greek list because three awesome (read: handsom and friendly) Greek brothers run it.

I couldn't figure it out the first time I went here. The design of the menu and restaurant is much like a chain restaurant, but with more vibrant colors and a certain energy to it.

I love little touches like that! The coffee is always fresh and served with heavy cream - indulgent yes, worth it, absolutely!\n\nThe Blueberry Pancakes (with their delicious blueberry compote) are the best I've had. On a side note, if you get regular pancakes along with another meal, they'll give you a side of the blueberry compote free of charge. I highly recommend doing so! The Strawberry Shortcake Flapjacks are sweet and may make you feel like you've ordered dessert for breakfast, but it's ok to be naughty every once in a while. ;) The Classic Eggs Benedict (which I subbed regular bacon for the Canadian bacon it comes with) wasn't the best I've had, but  I give it an 8 out of 10! The hash browns have always been cooked perfectly - extra crispy!\n\nI've never felt rushed at Butterfield's and I think that's rare for a busy breakfast place.

I know that might sound bad but I have good reason, Ive been burnt way to many times. Ive dealt with horrible service, unimaginative food and the whole annoying corporate shtick, complete with high chairs and screaming unmanageable children. Please don\'t get me wrong, Ive had similar disasters at locally owned restaurants, but knowing I\'m keeping my hard earned money in the community makes that brutally shrieking kid a little less bothersome.\n\nThe North Scottsdale location of Butterfield\'s caught me off guard. I was all primed to dislike everything, but was surprised with a few of the dishes and the service was fast, efficient, and well, annoyingly friendly. How anyone can be that chipper at 7:30am is beyond me.\n\nBeing a small national chain, only 4 location, they are complete with lame corporate shtick. Look up in the massive dining room and you\'ll see pictures of buttered and syrup laden waffles on the ceiling. Then there\'s the behemoth menu complete with "Egg-ceptional" Eggs and "Egg-cellent" Specialties, I wonder who makes this stuff up? I suppose some will find this clever.\n\nWith such a huge menu it took a few minutes to try to find the unique and interesting dishes. Started out with the Dutch Baby ($7.25); a large oven baked pancake that\'s finished with lemon juice, powdered sugar and optional syrup. The texture is light and airy comparable to a crepe with a crisp edge. Order this upon sitting, it could take up to 30 minutes to make depending on how busy the restaurant is.\n\nBiting into something heartier, The Bacon and Onion Skillet ($7.95) was well portioned for the low price tag. Crispy hashbrowns, bacon, grilled onions, 2 eggs with your choice of cheese and bread, was simple and satisfying.\n\nButterfield\'s originates from Illinois, so I should have given the Mexican Egg Burrito ($8.25) a little more thought before ordering. A whole wheat tortilla with chorizo, eggs and cheese, then in little plastic cups were sides of tasteless guacamole and salsa. Maybe in Illinois this is considered good but here in the land of Mexican food, it was a complete failure.\n\nSticking with the classics is a good idea, like the Country Benedict ($7.95). Perfectly cooked sausage patties on country biscuits then topped with eggs and country gravy.

I mean really, scrambled eggs for close to $10 just doesn\'t make any sense.\n\nScrutiny and suspicion aside, with so many breakfast choices out there Butterfield\'s isn\'t necessarily the best option, but if you\'re looking for a change up, this might be something different.', 'business_id': 'HDvCnqIf5twbMb5-eG1EJw', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2010-01-22', 'type': 'review'}

When I think breakfast, I think country restaurants that cater to farmers and ranchers - where the next meal might be a late dinner.  Three or four plates to hold all the food, and a 70 year old waitress that calls everybody "honey" or "sweetheart".  And hash browns that are home-made, not frozen, with a choice of different gravies. This is not one of those restaurants. \n\nButterfield\'s, to me, is very similar to other franchised breakfast chains.  The food is better than a Denny\'s or IHOP, and there is a little larger selection.  In fact, the menu is massive, and I\'m sure anyone could find something that would pique their interest.  But the most memorable thing about my breakfast here was the fresh squeezed orange juice, which was delicious.\n\nIt is huge restaurant and plenty of room for seating.  Both times that I was here was early on a weekday morning, so there was no line.  We have heard from others that on weekends the line is lengthy, but we never have had to wait.  And the service was great.\n\nOther than that, the food at our table, and we had four people eating, was uninspiring and average.  We had pancakes, waffles, omelettes, a scramble, bacon, ham, sausage, almost a taste of everything. And nothing stood out.  \n\nSo I will keep looking.  I know in a metropolitan area as big as Phoenix, there has to be a country restaurant specializing in breakfasts.

Had it been my order I would have asked for it to be extra well done, but my wife was more than happy with all the hash browns, green peppers, onions and ample amounts of hash and eggs. The omelette was stuffed with chorizo and fresh avocado, and was moist, fluffy and just spicy enough. On the side came a short stack of a couple pancakes, and after taking one bite I instantly regretted ordering an omelette (after all, it\'s not an omelette house, is it?). The pancakes were real cake-y, with crisp outsides, and next visit I\'m definitely ordering a full stack of their specialty. I\'m gonna be fat, and I\'m gonna be happy, and I\'m gonna be fat and happy!\n\nI don\'t know why I overlooked this place for so long...

It is much bigger and modern, so it lacks charm, but the food is better than standard faire. With that said, the creativity is good in their menu selection, but poorly executed. I had the banana french toast and was a bit disappointed. The banana bread used was fine, but too dense for french toast. It hardly had any egg coating to truly classify it as french toast. \n\nThey serve huge slices of raisin toast, but bigger is not necessarily better. Very dry and not flavorful. \n\nEggs were fine, and the service was good.

Our party included my 90 year old Mother on a walker, as well my sister, her husband and their 17 year old son. My nephew ordered a Panini which was very small, my sister ordered some crepes which she felt were not very good, my brother in law and I ordered a Denver Omelette which I was going to split with my Mother. When everything came my omelette was not fluffy and generous like my brother in laws.  Mine was small, dry and with hardly any vegetables.\nWhen our server came back she said it would do no good for her to complain to the cook or the management, because they wouldn\'t listen to her and it needed to come from me. She then said she had many similar complaints from customers throughout that week about their omelettes.\nSo when I received the bill I went to see the manager and he met me with an attitude like "why are you bothering me". I explained to him what we had ordered and told him there was a significant quality control problem with his omelettes and that I thought he would like to know.  I thought as a courtesy, I would let him know that he had a food quality problem that his server confirmed. He immediately said that our server never would have said that, and there is nothing wrong with our omelettes or anything else coming out of our kitchen. He as much as called me a liar, so I asked him for his card or at least his name, and he refused and told me if I didn\'t leave the restaurant he would escort me out and call the police, all because I asked him for his name or card.  I said I\'m more than happy to leave the restaurant, but I have to pay the bill, however because you have verbally threatened me twice I am going to make this incident very public.  He at the point informed me that he was also an owner... all the more reason why he should want to hear customer\'s comments (I was told by another waitress that his name was Chris).\nHe followed me back to the table and proceeded to threaten my 90 year old mother, my 17 year old Nephew and his parents who didn\'t even know about our discussion, that if they didn\'t leave the restaurant he was calling the police! This man\'s actions were despicable and unprofessional and left my family stunned and appalled.  \nMy question is, why would anyone consider going to this restaurant when a manager/owner is disrespectful to his customers and frightens his employees.', 'business_id': 'HDvCnqIf5twbMb5-eG1EJw', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2011-10-06', 'type': 'review'}

Yes, I understand that there are people waiting for tables, and the quicker you can get me out of there and the next table in, the more money you will make, but what happened today was a real disappointment.  \n\nMy daughter and I stopped in for breakfast at 9:15 this morning.  The restaurant was only about 3/4 full so we were seated immediately.  We placed our drink order moments after we were seated, and as soon as our server returned with our drinks we ordered our breakfast.  Our food was served within five minutes.  Everything was prepared exactly as we had requested.  \n\nWe were still enjoying our meal when the bus person stopped by to clear some dishes.  He attempted to take my (two year old) daughter's plate because she was not actively eating it.  I stopped him and said she was still working on it.  He also asked if he could clear my side order of pancakes.  There was still half of the order of on my plate and we had only been eating for about seven minutes.  I told him I was not finished, and he left our table empty handed.  \n\nAbout seven more minutes passed before he returned.  My daughter had eaten every last drop of her kid's chocolate chip pancakes and strip of bacon so he cleared her plate.  He again tried to clear my pancakes plate, despite the fact that I was holding my fork in my hand.  I told him, once more, that we were still working on them.  \n\nOur server came by and offered me another iced tea.  I accepted and asked that she bring the check and a small box for my leftovers.  She returned with the tea, check and take out box moments later.  I told her I needed to take my daughter to the restroom, but that we would be coming back right back to finish up as I handed her my debit card to pay.\n\nWhen we returned to the table it had been completely cleared.  My daughter's orange juice ($3.29 for a kid's size) which was nearly full was gone, as was the untouched iced tea my server had just brought and my side of pancakes.  The take out box with the remainder of my corned beef hash and eggs was sitting on the edge if the table with my check waiting to be signed.  The table had already been set for the next guests.  Unbelievable...We had only been in the restaurant for 31 minutes (from the time we entered the door until we came back to our cleared table)!\n\nIf you removed the obnoxious, overzealous busser from this equation our meal would have been four stars.  It was delicious.  Our server was friendly enough.  She made sure our needs were met and checked on us often.  \n\nI will likely return to give Butterfield's another chance, but if I am EVER rushed like I was today, you can rest assured I will not return.

They don't just have basic omelets and pancakes on the menu. No, they have succulent skillets filled with cheese, hashbrowns, eggs and toppings galore. They have buttermilk pancakes with different flavors such as Oreo cookie pancakes. They have bacon Belgian waffles. They have oven baked pancakes!

I ordered the Santa Fe Scrambler which comes with eggs (I opted for egg whites), Chorizo sausage, red jalape\xf1o pepper, onion & cheddar cheese. All this sits atop freshly made crispy hashbrowns. As if that's not enough, the scrambler comes with your choice of pancakes or toast. Of course I ordered the homemade buttermilk pancakes! The feast arrived relatively quickly and it was absolutely a feast! There was no way I could finish the meal, but every bite I took was better then the next. The hashbrowns were the perfect amount of crispy and the Chorizo had a nice kick to it. The avocado and peppers blended in quite nicely and there was plenty of cheese to go around! I doused my buttermilk pancakes with Butterfield's homemade syrup and wow, they know how to make a carbtastic pancake! I wish I could have consumed every last bite, but I ate until I was full and left happily full!\n\nI'm so happy that I've finally had the chance to eat at Butterfield's.

Definitely the best one for a sit-down Brunch with friends and family.\n\nWhy? the food is freaking LEGIT. (I was tempted to quote MC Hammer but I decided to hold back, so, you know, you're welcome). I ordered a California scramble (eggs, tons of gooey cheese, diced chicken, tomato and avocado) with a side of fruit (berries, melons an grapes) and upgraded my pancake serving to their Wildberry one (pancakes with berry butter on top and more berries). It was enough food to feed me for the entire day and seriously caused me to slow down for the remainder of my morning, not to mention my dreaded Camelback hike.\n\nEverything tasted amazingly fresh and had tons of flavor. The scramble was the best I have ever had because the eggs were fluffy, they did not hold back on the cheese, the avocado was tender and the chicken was seasoned well. It was a decent portion and the side of pancakes was incredibly indulgent- using their home maple syrup and their berry butter. Jesus, my mouth is watering again just thinking about it.\n\nOur server was on point and always ready to refill our water carafes or coffee cups. I saw another table order some sort of latte/hot chocolate drink and I almost pointed and ordered it too because it looked freaking fantastic. My friend ordered the corned beef skillet topped with TONS of cheese, meat, BACON and hash potatoes- super tasty. Other friends got the protein pancakes (or as they called BROTEIN, cause they're douches like that) and they were a bit drier (because of the oats and grains added) but still well done. The only negative I heard was my friend's salad was a little oily, but I did not try it nor can give an opinion of it myself.\n\nI will definitely come back, hopefully after not eating for a week so that I can order everything off the menu and pig out in a very unattractive and uncensored way.

In addition to more sweet items such as pancakes, French toast, Belgian waffles, and crepes, they also offer savory breakfasts such as skillets, omelettes, and scrambles.  The ingredients are very high quality, and they take a lot of care to make a great tasting meal for you.\n\nFeeling like I was in a caffeine deficit, I decided to try out the caramel macchiato (A little over $4, can be made iced or hot).  It was a nice blend of sweetness and creaminess, and the coffee itself was very smooth.  The coffee drinks are served as a 16 oz. size, so although they are pricey, you get a good amount of drink for your money.\n\nAfter poring through the extensive menu, I decided on the wildberry pancakes ($8.95).  They were moist, fluffy, with a nice selection of fresh berries (Blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, and blueberries) on the side.  Sandwiched in-between the pancakes were a mix of blueberries and a berry-mascarpone filling.  The pancakes were also coated with a lovely drizzle of vanilla cream (Made with real vanilla bean) and berry sauce.  There was enough sweetness and creaminess in the dish that I didn't need to add any syrup at all, nor add any of the butter that was included as a side.  The only thing I didn't really like was that there was a small amount of the mascarpone filling, and since there was just a smattering of it, it tasted like hot cream cheese inside the hot pancakes (Not very appealing to me at least since you usually associate mascarpone/sweet cream fillings with cold temperature).\n\nMy friend had an egg-white omelette, which was quite possibly the fluffiest egg-white omelette I've seen, and quite fluffy compared to normal omelettes I've seen!  I had a taste, and it was really well-executed.  The flavors inside the omelette were perfect.  I also tried some of the chorizo skillet, which was a very good portion, with hearty amounts of chorizo, veggie, cheese, and potato.\n\nWe came here on a Sunday around 10 A.M. and waited about 20-25 minutes for 3 people.  Service was friendly and fast despite the busy atmosphere.

If you are looking for an egg white with veggies omelette and a side of turkey bacon, I'm sure you could.  However, their specialty is found in their name--butter.  Everything is butter tasty.  \n\nTheir pancakes so good that after having them, we craved them for the next week.  They vary is tasty extremes, going from the normal buttermilk (there's the butter again), to gluten free, to Oreo cookie and s'mores pancakes.  Their short stack is an excellent side though a good meal in itself.  My personal favorite is their wild berry pancakes and their blueberry pancakes.  Both are stuffed with berries and the wild berry is smothered in cream.  I am gaining calories just by writing about them.  You want French Toast or waffles, they have those too. \n\nWe all had various items off the menu.  I chose a Create- Your-Own-Omelette with Nova Lox, cream cheese, red onion, and a side of hollandaise sauce. Another member of our group tried the Mexicana omelette.  Mmmm...finally decent chorizo in a non-Mexican restaurant.  The omelette came with avacado, cheese and a green chile sauce.  Besides omelettes, Butterfield's also has skillets, scramblers and other egg specialties.  \n\nThe only problem I saw was the waitstaff and the wait.  This is a large, popular restaurant.  With so many people, there is an initial wait and then there is also a wait for our food.  If you go, try an off time.  What ever do, don't go on a Sunday morning!

Not unusual for a Saturday or Sunday morning, there will be people waiting both outside and inside the restaurant. The crowd might be large, but thankfully due to the number of seats and the fast-paced staff, you typically won't need to wait more than 15 minutes.\n\nFrom a pure ratings perspective, Butterfields falls right in the middle of my spots for brunch. I frequent the place because of proximity, convenience and comfort. Butterfields is all about the home-cooked style meal that leaves you happy and your stomach satisfied. There are certainly places that are worse, however if you're looking for a unique or exceptional meal, you may want to look elsewhere. This really isn't a bad thing in Butterfield's case, because I believe they are striving to reach the masses with their food. Of all the menu choices, if you are looking for something a little more unique (at least for the Scottsdale area), try the Dutch Baby, a baked pancake of sorts.\n\nThis past visit, I had the chicken scrambler with fruit and potatoes. As with most other breakfast places, the portions are quite large here as well. The flavors overall were good, however one complaint I have was that there was too much filler put into the eggs. A lot of restaurants use milk or cream to make the eggs more fluffy, however in this case there was a little too much added. The eggs tasted a bit diluted.\n\nI'll continue going to Butterfields because of the comfort. I'll continue trying different items on their menu, but I feel confident that it will keep consistent with my experience there. For most, that's really not a bad thing.\n\n[This review is based on my visit on July 27, 2013]", 'business_id': 'HDvCnqIf5twbMb5-eG1EJw', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2013-07-30', 'type': 'review'}

After a couple years or so of having altered the menu, it appears that they have brought back the ever-so-popular oven baked specialties.\n\nAlthough the menu is not 100 percent the same as before, having brought back the baby apple pancake and dutch baby have made the trip up to Scottsdale worth the trip for an indulgent breakfast.\n\nAside from the noisy and busy environment, and tacky but fitting decor, Butterfield\'s does have some stand-out items on their menu. From the fresh-squeezed juices (albeit small and overpriced portions) to the unique egg specialties and pastry items, this is the place for an occasional breakfast treat when you want something a bit more upscale than the traditional chain diners.\n\nThe highlight on the menu, in my opinion, is the baked baby apple pancake. Prepare for the 30 minute wait, and if you want any shot in being able to finish a decent portion of the plate-sized "pancake", don\'t eat anything before your visit. The large treat comes to the table piping hot and is puffed up a couple of inches tall. Although all of the caramelized apples and brown sugar are begging to be eaten at the moment\'s notice, do yourself a favor and wait another 5 minutes to avoid burning your mouth and ruining the rest of your meal with this fresh-out-of-the-oven delight.\n\nThe apple pancake (more like an apple pie that you can have all to yourself), is packed with the equivalent of no less than at least 2 granny smith apples. The thick, doughy crust and the sticky and crunchy brown sugar topping keep you forking for more. Despite the time it may take you to work through this beast, the steam keeps pouring out.\n\nThe service is pretty decent, but with the crowd of people and all of the glass and ceramic cups and plates, the clatter and chatter can get very ear piercing.

It had a lot of cheese, but other than that it was amazing. My lil bro ordered the pancakes and those were so so fluffy and wonderful!

No way I could go to a pancake house and not order pancakes. I got the good ol' buttermilk pancakes, and they were exceptional. Light and fluffy, the syrup (which is their own brand) definitely hit the spot. They advertise that pancakes take up to 30 minutes to cook, but our order came out no more than 10 minutes after placing it. Decided to get a side of bacon and it was cooked perfect, crispy, very good. My wife ordered the Corned beef hash Eggs Benedict and it was spectacular. In fact, if I make it back to this place I'd order this with a side of pancakes. Hash was really, really good and the poached eggs were good perfectly. Their fresh squeezed orange juice is off the hook good, worth the extra money - the small is very small though so go big or don't go at all.\n\nService was good enough. Drinks were refilled without asking, server was friendly but very busy (there was a 30 minute wait). \n\nDefinitely worth a stop if you're in the area, looking forward to going back sometime in the future!", 'business_id': 'HDvCnqIf5twbMb5-eG1EJw', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2013-10-09', 'type': 'review'}

I have enjoyed this restaurant with excellent customer service especially during busy times.  That\'s why I continue to eat there.  However after today\'s incident, I have second thoughts.\n\nToday I came with my Aunt and friend at noon.  We were seated right away.   I understand the kitchen gets backed during this period but receiving our food at 1:30  is totally unacceptable.  I have never waiting this long for the food to be served.\n\nI ordered a turkey burger which came out half cooked.  I spoke to our server that it needed to be sent back and rather than having the kitchen properly cook the burger she sent the manager over. Chris is the manager and told me that they cook all their burgers medium. In fact, he was quite rude.  I assume your managers receive proper training in etiquette but one "must have slipped through the cracks."  I believe he has a problem understanding the difference between a hamburger and turkey burger.  A turkey burger needs to be cooked all the way through and he was arguing with me that that it was. It wasn\'t!\n\nAfter waiting another half hour to get my new turkey burger, I did get one that was cooked through.  The server understood I was quite irritated over the entire incident and yet she failed to comp the burger as a way of saying they were sorry.  To my surprise, the bill came and was charge for the burger.  Again the manager came over and expressed under no circumstances would they take the charge off.  REALLY????  Never mind that we had to wait over an hour to get the food that was not properly cooked.\n\nAfter expressing my displeasure with Chris that I would not be coming back, his response was  "that was my choice."  Is that how your managers treat customers?\n\nThere was no need for his behavior.  I\'m paying for an enjoyable meal with good service. What happened to trying to please your customers?

We were seated right away on hard chairs on a table for 4.  All the clutter in the middle with all the condiments is very disgusting and should be re-worked.  We put everything to the corner to get it out of our way.  Someone came right over to take our drink order and then they brought out the wrong tea, we ordered green tea, they brought us earl grey.  We ordered hot water with lemon and they forgot the lemon, we ordered Orange Juice and they forgot to bring it until we asked them more than 4x...Finally after the drink orders were straighten out and they brought us the correct stuff, our orders came out.  Avoid the hash browns, they have no flavor what so ever and the only thing in their HB are potatoes no salt or pepper, we sent them back and they bought out a very tiny bowl of fruit for us which had less than 10 small pieces of fruit.  Not real sure why they put powdered sugar on the pancakes, but they do and we did not know this so had to send our pancakes back, powdered sugar on cakes does not taste good, it is not a dessert but a breakfast item.\n\nThe gluten-free pancakes were dry, sweet and hard to eat without lots of fluid.  The make your own egg omelet with baby spinach an cheese was ok - light and airy.  Not real sure what all the fuss is about, but we were not impressed, the food is not a wow factor - everything is just either okay or not okay...nothing will wow your taste buds and there are other places in town which do this.  I wish someone someplace would make a great tasting gluten free pancake which is not dry.  We probably will not be back, not a favorite place of ours, we have had too many problems with their food or lack of good tasting food.', 'business_id': 'HDvCnqIf5twbMb5-eG1EJw', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2014-04-24', 'type': 'review'}

The food is top notch and consistent, as is the service. They strive to have your food to you within seven minutes of you sitting down, and I've seldom seen them miss that window even at peak hours. \n\nPricing is more than reasonable. You're looking at a dollar or two more than a place like iHop or Dennys, and the food and service are in completely different league.\n\nBoth Butterfields and Butters have arguably achieved the status of being a tourist destination. They're one of the places that absolutely everybody has heard of, and people visiting Scottsdale almost always make it point to visit. \n\nWhile I won't claim to speak to the full merits of everything that goes into making an operation of this class, I will make one statement. The owners Chris, Teddy and George all understand a concept that is lost on many. When you run an establishment of this caliber you're no longer merely in the restaurant business, you're in the hospitality business. Pay attention to any truly great business, they all share one core quality - they all make it a point to make you feel as if you have just found a second home. \n\nAs a customer, I have felt as if I was special since the day I walked in. The trick, of course, is that they are able to create that effect for every customer that walks in the door. Judging by how packed this place always is, it's safe to say that the full extent of the experience Butterfields creates is not lost on many.", 'business_id': 'HDvCnqIf5twbMb5-eG1EJw', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2014-09-28', 'type': 'review'}

I tried a bit of my friend's crepe that was topped with berry sauce, whip and stuffed with cream. So delicious, not super sweet and definitely a treat to please one with a sweet tooth however.

We had to have brunch here while we were in town visiting for the weekend. Butterfield's is one of the fond memories we have of when we lived in AZ. We were pleasantly surprised to see an updated restaurant - they modernized it quite a bit and took down some dividers so it really brightens up the place. Not sure when they did this remodel as we haven't been back since we moved out of AZ three years ago...but it looks great. It's as busy as ever but we were smart and arrived at about 8:15am. We only had to wait about 10 minutes. If you arrive after 9am, be prepared to wait. We walked out about 9:30am and the crowd outside was growing by the minute. However, they have a large waiting area inside and out so that helps. Their food is just as good as we remember...we HAD to get a bacon waffle or it wouldn't have been the same. They are still on point with their coffee game - pouring us our first cups almost immediately after sitting down and never letting it get past half empty. My little one loved his pancakes and happily sat in his high chair nom nom noming away at them. Delicious! Thanks for still being around Butterfields...we look forward to more brunches whenever we visit AZ!", 'business_id': 'HDvCnqIf5twbMb5-eG1EJw', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2015-11-25', 'type': 'review'}

Especially when I asked about the Corn Beef Hash. This time instead of the skillet, I got it on a plate with hash browns, which look like scallop potatoes but was thin and crispy around the edges.

She gave us a pager and told us it would be 5 to 10 minutes for a seat. Close to 20 minutes went by so I walked up to ask what the deal was, she looked clearly confused. She told me someone else had come up with the same pager number...how is that possible? She apologized, but cmon, seating people isn\'t rocket science....or is it? Apparently she wrote the wrong pager number next to my name....I spoke to the manager about it and he seemed to somewhat care half heartedly, But also implied "I maybe had set my pager down somewhere and two dudes picked it up and took our place in line"....first of all, how did I still have a pager when I walked up to the hostess stand? Secondly, I don\'t know who would set a pager down somewhere and forget about it if they\'re seriously waiting for a table! I had my Grandmother with me, wanted to take her to a nice Christmas Eve breakfast...the pager never left my hands! Me setting my pager down somewhere makes no sense and he\'s bogus for believing the hostess who fed him that lie...I guess 3 girls working the hostess stand isn\'t enough...Maybe they need 5 girls up there to make sure the job gets done properly...? I ordered the French toast, my grandmother had the eggs and bacon.
