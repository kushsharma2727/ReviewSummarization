My boyfriend googled and this place popped up on the Madison Better Breakfast Bureau (what a fantastic idea, by the way) -  so based on the ratings on that site and yelp, I was SUPER excited to eat there.\nSo why such a low rating?  I really hated the set up.  It was this morning (Sunday) so I knew it was going to be crowded.  I thought it would be like a normal restaurant where you go, wait an excruciating amount of time for a table, and then sit down and have some time to look over the menu, decide what to get, and order.  No. That is not how it works... I felt very rushed the entire time I was there.  I felt as though I had 25 seconds to look at the menu.  Order, get a number and sit at a table and wait for the food.\nThe coffee is self serve (which is not the part that is the problem) but is  in such an inconveniently located place directly next the to the cash register that it is super crowded, you can\'t get refills because the crazy line is ALWAYS in front of it.  And I\'m sorry, but if I\'m paying $2.25 for a "bottomless" cup of coffee, that means I want a refill.  And I was under the impression the term "bottomless" stems from a waitress coming over and refilling your cup before you see the bottom... Anyway - no way to get refills of your coffee... Moving on - \nI was also sitting at a table directly near the coffee station, and where the food comes up from the kitchen (and also located directly next to the seats where people who have already ordered and are waiting for tables are sitting).  My chair was bumped no less than 30 times by people walking back and forth (staff and customers alike).  \nNow - about the people waiting for tables - I am eating my breakfast.  I do NOT want you staring down at me because you have already ordered and are waiting for your food.  It makes me feel uncomfortable, and made me eat faster, and not really enjoy my meal.   That is not their fault, but rather the fault of the set up of the restaurant.  Perhaps you should not have people order food before they definitely have a table.  \nOverall, it was just very odd.  I would definitely not return based on the set up..

Even though we were told over the phone that the crowds "weren\'t that bad," it was a complete shitshow in there. Busboys fighting through the crowds to get to tables, a line going from the counter to the door, background noise so loud that you have to scream what you want to order, and a restaurant that was way too small to contain it all. They haven\'t done a very good job at all managing these crowds and maximizing their available space.\n\nNot helping Marigold is the fact that you have to order your food from the counter and take a number, and that they can\'t even be bothered to bring your drinks out to you. I had to get water from a jug on a table placed in the worst spot imaginable (right next to the counter), where I couldn\'t even move my elbows. And despite the massive line, the girl taking orders at the counter didn\'t seem to have any issue with having a long conversation with anyone who was placing an order. \n\nWhile ordering from a counter would ultimately save you money on tip, the savings are balanced out by the price of the food itself. You\'ll pay just as much as you would for sit-down service at another breakfast joint.\n\nSo, given the abhorrent service, you\'re probably wondering how my rating is so high. The fact is, when you serve food this good, you can abuse your customers like this and they\'ll enjoy it. Seriously, this is some of the best breakfast food I have ever had.\n\nI ordered a special called "The Scrambler," which was scrambled eggs mixed up with cheese and vegetables. The eggs were cooked perfectly, with a fluffy consistency that is practically nonexistent at any other restaurant. I also got French rosemary toast and their signature "Marigold Potatoes" on the side. \n\nWhile the toast was unique, it wasn\'t anything special. The potatoes were incredible. I don\'t know what they do to them to make them so soft and so crispy at the same time, or what spices made them taste so perfect. You have to try it, and fortunately, it comes with almost every dish they serve.\n\nI also ordered some thick and fluffy buttermilk pancakes which were topped with a sweet mango butter. However, they served it with a pathetic amount of syrup. I had to substitute the lack of sweetness with the jam on the table, which was incredibly fresh. It was definitely made in the restaurant, without the addition of massive amounts of sugar.\n\nThe jam is like every other ingredient Marigold uses. Everything tastes fresh and organic, like they were growing the food right there in their kitchen. The prices and crowds here are easily justified by the fact that when you order food from Marigold Kitchen, you know that they\'re going to serve you nothing but food made from the very highest quality of ingredients.', 'business_id': 'J3A5V0Hl07o_KQSI2hHf_g', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2010-07-13', 'type': 'review'}

I visited Madison a week ago, and I am still salivating over the deliciousness of my meal at Marigold!  I had the grilled Angus hamburger with gruyere - incredible!  I usually add ketchup to burgers, but with one bite in, I knew I wouldn't need any.  My burger was juicy and perfectly medium-rare, with the right ratio of meat to veggies to bun.  It wasn't too greasy (like many burgers can get) and it was well put together. And the sauce!  My mouth had a most pleasant after taste (strange, but true), and I have to say that this was truly one of the best burgers I have ever eaten.  My friend ordered a grilled cheese and gazpacho soup.  I had a bite of each, and both were delicious.\n\nThe decor is super cute and hip, with bold yellow to brighten the mood.  The wait wasn't too bad and the service was solid.

It was hard to hear people at the other end of our table. I loved the menu - full of fresh dairy and produce from the land of cheese! I had an omelet with veggies and cheese, with salad, wheat toast and fruit. It was delicious.

But only three triangles of french toast?  Where was the fourth?  (On someone else's plate, I had to assume.)  \n\nWhat sense does it make to deprive me of that half-slice of French toast?  Surely not pricing sense, as it couldn't cost much of anything.  The berries on the plate were ripe and plump.  But there were a total of two black berries and two raspberries.  For color, I guess.\n\nCan't praise the quality of the link sausages.  A side of three sausages were an extra $3.  They weren't bad.  They were just small, with the most pedestrian flavor, no smoke, no spice, no herbs.  Cooked.  That's all one could really say about them.\n\nSo at $13 my plate left me pretty hungry and very sad.  I perfectly expect to pay prices like that for farm to table restaurant food.  But don't let me walk away sad.", 'business_id': 'J3A5V0Hl07o_KQSI2hHf_g', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2012-07-09', 'type': 'review'}

The pancakes overall are somewhat bland, and everything tastes similar.  In the end, you're really just eating a maple syrup conveyor.\n\nDuck Confit Hash: $9.95\nJudge an ice-cream shop by its vanilla, sure.  But if you put the poultry Inception that is duck confit on the menu, I'm going to try it.\n-The duck confit was remarkably dry for something that had supposedly been rendered in its own fat, and definitely was not worth even the ten bucks they were asking.\n-While I was hoping it was made into a hash in order to stretch a small quantity of great duck into a larger serving, it seems that the hash was more a method to hide the fact that you were just being served bits of salty duck.\n\n\nAmbiance:  The real reason I rated this place so low is because of the overall dining environment.  It would be two stars, were it not for the fact that I know I'm going during their busiest times.\n\nIf you come here during the weekend, it will be packed.\nChances are, nobody will greet you or explain anything to you, but that's fine as you will have stood in a line by the time you entered the first door.  This line leads directly to the cash register, but does wrap around a pillar that holds the menus, so you can figure out what you want while you watch other people eat.\nIf you decide to grab a seat before ordering (seems reasonable, right?), you will be informed (loudly enough for everyone else in line to get the memo) that guests should please refrain from trying to get seats prior to ordering.  Alright, message received, the cluster' will begin after you pay.\nYou'll order, sit down at the waiting area that is pleasantly placed right next to the restrooms, holding your number tag like a branded cow, and desperately look for the next group to leave (It's best to have any females in the party have a scarf or purse handy to drop on the seat to claim territory, as -from experience- other parties will be doing the exact same thing).\n\nThe aforementioned just-okay food will arrive, and you can finally eat.  They bring you your coffee as well, and you can finish your meal in relative peace.\n\n--That is--, unless you arrived at a time that they were so busy, that there was still a line as you were finishing your meal.  In that case, their staff is apparently trained to actually ask you to either finish up your conversation and leave, or migrate to a smaller table so that they can seat another party.\nKeep in mind, this is about two minutes after you pay your check, and are just trying to drink down the last bit of coffee.  By no means do you need to make any effort to delay your own exit for this wonderful display of hospitality to occur.\n\nWhat in the absolute hell kind of place, one block away from the Capitol, doesn't have any consistent or fair seating logistic when the line goes out the door, and asks their own patrons to either leave or change tables when they are literally 95% of the way through their meal?\n\n\nIn summary, this location has honestly been a terrible way to start my weekends 3 times out of 4, may be better during weekdays but I do not have the schedule for that, and is really only worth going to if you want to see or be seen by rich housewives taking their preppy children out to brunch.", 'business_id': 'J3A5V0Hl07o_KQSI2hHf_g', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2013-07-28', 'type': 'review'}

I wholeheartedly agree with them all - so instead I\'m going to try and offer some suggestions that can help you navigate the conundrum that is Marigold\'s seating situation. As noted per other reviews, you stand in line to order at the counter - then wait in the little waiting area - then an employee leads you to a table. At least, that\'s how it\'s supposed to work. \n\nOn my most recent visit, however, people were grabbing tables while they were still in line. These folks probably didn\'t see the teeny tiny sign outside the restaurant that lays out the table etiquette - most likely due to the fact that the sign is indeed, teeny tiny. When this happens, Marigold employees have to decide whether to 1) ask these people to get up, which is awkward or 2) let them sit there, which screws over people waiting patiently after ordering at the counter. \n\nI think Marigold could do a better job of communicating the seating policy  -either by having a full-time host at the front of the restaurant or posting more signage. Probably both. \n\nUntil they change the policy though - I would not suggest dining at Marigold with a large group unless you arrive very early or late in the dining cycle. I would not suggest eating at Marigold if you want to sit and chat for an hour or two over food (you will feel awkward with people staring at you while waiting for your table). \n\nWhat I will suggest is going to Marigold with a small group, 2-4 people, and following the seating etiquette. The employees will find you a spot - and if others are snagging tables before they\'re supposed to - give them the stink eye or say "screw it" and grab a table yourself. \n\nThe experience is less frustrating if you know what to expect - and the food at Marigold really is worth it.', 'business_id': 'J3A5V0Hl07o_KQSI2hHf_g', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2013-08-05', 'type': 'review'}

Many business travelers eat at a hotel out of convenience. It's close to your room and toothbrush. I like to go outside the box. I can't stand the powdered eggs, lumpy oatmeal, tasteless pancakes, greasy bacon and burnt toast. I need something fresh to start my day. \n\nA few years ago I came across this place and they open at 7am. I love getting out of my hotel room and grabbing a table outside here. Luckily the weather has been pleasant on the times I have visited here.  I imagine dinning outside in February would be brutal plus the coffee would freeze. \n\nThis place is also located down the street from the Wisconsin Capital. There website claims you can hit it with one of there muffins because its so close. Is that a challenge? Plus will you bail me out of jail? I'll wait for a message from you before ever trying that. Ha! (On a side note...Dear Gov Walker I would never do that...I was just adding humor to my Yelp Review)\n\nI've tried a few things on the menu, over the years. I do love grabbing a fresh brewed coffee and/or a fresh squeezed OJ. I've also tried the breakfast egg sandwich and the omelette with ham & gruyere cheese on several different occasions. Both breakfast items were delicious. Also the eggs they use are farm fresh and organic. You can really taste the freshness plus its good for you.  I have never tried the lunch menu because I'm usually stuck working but the breakfast is good here. \n\nIt is places like this that make my travels fun. It is always exciting to find a delicious new fresh place to eat on the road. The sad part is leaving Madison, after my work is done and then heading home. I never know if I will ever come back and visit, until work sends me this way...the good thing is that Madison is not too far from Chicago, so I can always take a road trip. \n\nIf you're in your Madison hotel room reading this at breakfast or lunch (they close at 3pm on weekdays and 2pm on weekends), then it's time to sneak by the crappy breakfast lobby bar and get some real fresh food. The walk over will be pleasant and the capital building is a beautiful building to look at too.

The FH had visited and insisted this was the only/best place to go for breakfast on the square, if not in Madison.  Having lived in Madison as a student and eating many delish Madison breakfasts (Lazy Jane's, Sunroom, etc.), I was a bit skeptical.  However, Marigold truly lived up to his claims and trumped nearly all of my prior breakfast experiences in the city (except maybe the waffles at Indie Coffee).\n\nYes, you are not supposed grab a seat until you order.  This is a good policy; I like it.  We never had a problem finding a table, nor did we see anyone struggle with it.  Granted, these were weekdays and the weather made using the outdoor seating both possible and appealing.  Still, there was plenty of signage and little confusion, and I appreciate the fair spirit of the policy.\n\nThe food was outstanding all three days.  Standouts were the chilli poached eggs, with their excellent execution and beautiful presentation, the massive slices of fluffy quiche, and the iced chai lattes, which were beautifully spicy and never tasted exactly the same twice, which I hopehopehope means they make their own blend.  And, coming in from Seattle, we really appreciate that breakfast cost only about $20 each day for two satisfying plates and two nicely sized coffee/tea drinks.\n\nI knocked them down one star because one day their service was pretty off.  They were busier than any of the other days there and did appear to be training to new people, but we ended up getting our drinks (in messy cups) quite a bit after we received our plates.  This meant that the FH's Americano was still undrinkably hot even though we had nearly finished out meals.  Our drink and meal delivery had been perfectly paced the first two days, so this was kind of a downer.  Still, this is only a minor blemish in three days of excellent, reasonably priced food and prompt service in a cute little restaurant that is a short walk from the accommodations on the square.", 'business_id': 'J3A5V0Hl07o_KQSI2hHf_g', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2013-09-28', 'type': 'review'}

Wherever you are. Whew, ok. Now, here's the review...\n\nMarigold Kitchen was recommended by my sister who is a Madison-ite. We were perusing the Dane County Farmers Market during the summer and she suggested we meet up with some of her coworkers and have a quick bite. Marigold's was paaaaacked. The line was out the door. There's no wait-to-be-seated area, it's a order at the front (well, the side) and find a table if you can. The waiters are definitely helpful in scouting out a spot, but it can be chaotic if you're unprepared. Luckily, we found a nice spot outside on their tiny little sidewalk patio. \n\nI'm a slave to good French Toast, so it wasn't even a question of what I would order. We also ordered a giant carafe of orange juice which was tasty, but nothing I've have better. For the French Toast bread they use awesome brioche. They had lightly drizzled sweet cream on top with a mixture of fresh summer berries that included strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries. Slivered almonds and a side of maple syrup completed the French Toast. It was...delectable. Perfectly crisp on the outside, but thoroughly cooked yet moist on the inside. The sweet cream and berries were perfect without the syrup. But I prefer not-so-sweet breakfast, errr...brunch items. My sister had the Duck Confit Hash which she raved about. I'm not a duck fan, so I opted out of trying. But I'll take her word for it. The French Toast was more than enough for me to 5* review this place.", 'business_id': 'J3A5V0Hl07o_KQSI2hHf_g', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2013-10-05', 'type': 'review'}

The pancakes are fluffy and have a slightly sweet flavor to them without syrup, the sausage links are great, the frittatas and omelets are very light yet packed with different flavors within. The best aspect, in my opinion, is the blending of flavors in the dishes. Often there is a combination of sweet and savory, or salty and sweet, or spicy and rich. The place is unpretentious (order at the counter, get your own coffee) and friendly. They have a dish for everyone: For the traditional "eggs, bacon, and toast" folks, they have excellent selections, and for the more adventurous eaters they provide unique twists on brunch classics.\n\nOverall, if you moderately enjoy breakfast food and are pondering where to eat in Madison, I\'d highly recommend Marigold!', 'business_id': 'J3A5V0Hl07o_KQSI2hHf_g', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2014-02-01', 'type': 'review'}

I have also had the Honey Lavender Latte. That one trumps its mocha friend. Here is my issue. These are all specials that only last a week.

Converted a couple people to liking brunch simply from their great experiences here.

Don't even like tomatoes and I like how they taste in this sandwich!), side of breakfast potatoes (just a little kick that even my spice-wary friends appreciate), and their iced tea. Classic, delicious, and keeps me full and happy... until the next meal. Their service is wonderful, and I have yet to wait more than 20-25 minutes for a table (and that's on a bad day. Though admittedly I rarely go with more than 3-4 people). During the summer, the outside tables are coveted spaces and well worth it, especially when the farmers market is happening on Saturdays!\n\nPro-tip if you love their iced tea. 1) You can get free refills, and 2) they are AMAZING and will fill you a separate cup to take to go.

I have to say that most all of them were met. This place is pretty cool! I was here at 10 AM on a Saturday and we got a table right away. My mom and I both ordered a Cafe Miel and Chipotle Chorizo Scone to start our meal. The lattes were amazing, definitely one of the best I've had. The scone was also delicious - not dry at all and the melted cheese on top was divine. \n\nFor my meal I ordered the special Asiago and Herb Crusted French Toast. Here's where my only issue came. When my plate came there were no fig preserves on it. However I was so hungry that I didn't even notice until after I was done eating! My plate was clean, when I saw another order come out that had fig preserves. Bummer because it probably would have made it that much more delicious! It was clearly yummy enough either way as I finished my plate pretty quick. The Arugula salad was a great complement to the rich french toast.\n\nMy mom ordered the Tofu Scrambler and enjoyed her meal as well. The ambiance of this place is really cute and homey. I guess I'll just have to return and try the dish as its' supposed to be eaten, hopefully they don't forget the jam this time.", 'business_id': 'J3A5V0Hl07o_KQSI2hHf_g', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2015-01-25', 'type': 'review'}

It's one of those places that some of my friends love, but is simply just not for me.\n\nFor instance, I tried their Tuna Melt today for lunch. It was edible, but not one of the better I've had. I didn't like the sweetness of the house-made pickles, nor the sliced tomato under the melted cheese. I didn't even get a hint of rosemary from the bread. I make a much better Tuna Melt at home with very minimal effort. The arugula salad on the side was fine, as was the cabbage salad. But, did I mention that this meal was $11? For it's averageness, it would be better priced at perhaps $8-9. I opted for the free water to keep my meal at a decent price.\n\nMy friend ordered one of their lunch specials (some sort of salad with beans and prosciutto) and also felt the $11 price was a bit much.\n\nI've been more happy with brunch at Marigold, but never really felt like lunch was worth my time or money. \n\nFor brunch, I do like the their omelets, and their Chili Braised Chicken Sandwich is quite tasty.

I ordered the quiche which was described as having andouille sausage, broccoli, red peppers and Gouda. I ordered a side of Marigold potatoes because the quiche only came with greens. The handsome man I was with ordered the duck confit hash. \n\nOnly the potatoes were tasty. My quiche was bland, even the sausage had minimal flavor. The crust was overly dense and chewy, not at all flaky. There was no Gouda to be found. I never season my food at restaurants but it needed salt and quite a bit of pepper. \n\nThe duck confit hash looked greasy and disgusting. The potatoes were not even cooked through, I could barely get a fork in the piece he gave me. I did not try it but he also had to douse it in salt and pepper for it to be edible. There were strange pieces of something in the hash that looked like melted plastic and had the same texture. He left those on the plate. The hash only came with greens, no toast. Toast was an extra $2.50. We did not order any. \n\nThe potatoes were a nice mix of crispy and soft with just enough greasiness to enhance the flavor. \n\nMy companion also ordered a Bloody Mary and they suggested the heirloom mix. It tasted like pur\xe9ed fresh tomatoes with tons of seeds and no depth of flavor. It was horrible and he didn't even finish half. \n\nThey never came back to check on us after bringing the food, so we didn't have the opportunity to share our disappointment. We also had to borrow salt and pepper from the table next to us\n\nThe decor is cute and everything LOOKS tasty, it just really lacked flavor. We were very disappointed especially after spending over $35 on breakfast.", 'business_id': 'J3A5V0Hl07o_KQSI2hHf_g', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2015-10-10', 'type': 'review'}

I've been here twice so far and the food has not failed to impress me regardless of how busy it is. The staff are extremely nice and seem happy doing their job. \n\nThe first time we were here, it was a busy Saturday morning and the line was out the door but the turnover was fast. The food came really fast and we were in and out in no time with happy bellies. I had their salmon frittata and their scrambler with rosemary toast this time. Also a must-try is their hazelnut almond mocha and their lavender white chocolate mocha (a bit too sweet for my taste). \n\nI love this place!", 'business_id': 'J3A5V0Hl07o_KQSI2hHf_g', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2015-10-16', 'type': 'review'}

If there\'s a "deal on the table"...you\'ll be setting yourself up for success over Marigold breakfast.\n\nThis restaurant was opened by the same team that owns Sardine Restaurant (Willy St) and Gates and Brovi (Monroe St) and it is a sparkling, but small, gem. \n\nMK doesn\'t receive 5 stars because major congestion can accumulate at the registers and mobility will be of major concern. This also occurs at various times in the dining space due to close proximity of the tables. \n\nThe toast can be burned around the edges at times, but I have no qualms with it...slab a little egg yolk or jam on them, and you won\'t notice (plus, it\'s toast, deal with it). \n\nIf you\'re a brunch aficionado, you understand some types of breakfast potatoes can flavor-cover your tongue and make your coffee taste a bit funky. This is the case with MK, but again, I haven\'t been phased by it.\n\nTheir seasonal pancake selection is EVERYTHING, and their coffee is often on point. Usually, during quieter crowd times, I am able to grab a coffee, sit and sip while I wait for my late-arriving group, or mull over food decisions, then head back to the register, order, and pay. \n\nOther food recommendations include the MK breakfast sandwich is always a tasty fall-back. As with the toast, you want to make sure the bread is properly toasted, or I would recommend the poached egg prosciutto with rosemary toast..\n\nNow stop readying, and go eat some MK breakfast!!!', 'business_id': 'J3A5V0Hl07o_KQSI2hHf_g', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2015-10-16', 'type': 'review'}

The food absolutely sets the standard, and the atmosphere is nice and comfortable. If I were rating on food alone, I would rate 5 stars no question. But there are some downsides: Marigold is perhaps too small, which makes for long wait times anytime you go and a /very/ cramped dining area. Additionally, its prices are high, which makes Marigold more of a special-occasion dining location than a weekly treat. The food certainly makes up for the negatives, but something to keep in mind.', 'business_id': 'J3A5V0Hl07o_KQSI2hHf_g', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2015-12-03', 'type': 'review'}
