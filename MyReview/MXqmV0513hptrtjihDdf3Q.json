(It is nestled within a business park so look carefully when going there for the first time.)  \n\nAt first glance we all thought .. "what a cool new place" .. the decor is cool and contemporary .. very warm and inviting .. there is a bar/lounge area toward the front .. and the restaurant part behind that.  Very nice!\n\nThe cuisine is "American dishes with Mediterranean influences." The menu changes daily depending on what\'s in season or what Exec Chef Matt Silverman creates. Tonight there was a nice variety .. everything from pasta, to fresh fish, to lamb osso buco, to  a few different steaks. \n\nFor starters we ordered the Crab Cakes, Calamari and Salami Carpaccio. The Crab Cakes were quite good .. tasty and not too much filler. The Calamari and Salami were just "ok."\n\nThe main course my husband and I ordered was DELICIOUS.\nWe had the Veal Scalopine with crimini mushrooms in a light marsala wine sauce. The veal and sauce were true PERFECTION! \nIt came with a side of capellini aglio olio which was equally tasty. My mom had the crab ravioli which she said was good as well.\n\nWe skipped dessert as we were all too full but the selection was quite nice and we vowed to save room the next time. \n\nThe reason for the 3 stars though .. was the service! The hostess sat us immediately and was very friendly, but once we got to the table .. we waited .. and waited .. and waited. Many people walked by our table, but not one even acknowledged us .. we were joking that perhaps we were invisible. \n\nFinally after sitting there for 15 minutes (yes, we timed it) .. one of the assistant servers noticed that we had been sitting there for a while and came by and asked if we\'d like some water while we were sitting there .. she also brought by the menus. \n\nOur waiter finally came by and took our order .. he literally had the personality of a wooden door! Just wrote down our order and left. The assistant however . . was a total sweetheart the whole evening .. came by to see if we were okay .. refilling drink, bringing by the dessert menu and was very very nice. She was really "on it" .. while our waiter was pretty much non-existent. He was always a step behind .. offering us more drinks, dessert after the very efficient assistant.   Needless to say .. we tipped him the standard and gave the assistant the majority of the gratuity. \n\nWe all agreed that we would go back and give it one more shot as the food and variety on the menu were excellent. And since they are a new establishment .. perhaps the service will improve.', 'business_id': 'MXqmV0513hptrtjihDdf3Q', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2007-01-21', 'type': 'review'}

For starters, we had calamari with curry aioli (very savory if you love that curry flavor- a very unique blending of flavors) as well as 2 of their wood-fired flat breads.  The flat breads were decent and good to share (7 slices) and whet your appetite.  \nFor the main entree, I had the free-range half chicken with "mac and cheese", rapini and sage reduction.  Chicken was moist, tender and bursting with flavor.  Mac and cheese were unique with its green pesto-like color, but the flavor complimented the chicken very well.  Hands down the best chicken I\'ve ever had!  The other guys had the steak and potatoes, which made me wish I ordered that instead.  I bummed a few pieces of steak, and it was an explosion of flavor in my mouth.  Best steak I\'ve ever had.

I debated between the halibut and the bouillabaisse. I've never really had the bouillabaisse but I only wanted to try it because it said it had saffron in it. And it looked good with baby lobster, scallops, mussels, clams and calamari. The waitress said that dish was featured in wine magazine so of course I had to go with that dish. It was delicious, very light, and the seafood was all delicious. \n\nMy only complaint was the service was a tad bit slow when we were ordering but maybe that is because we kept ordering appetizers, the wine took awhile to order, (so the waitress and sommelier were busy taking these orders and setting our table with wine glasses and such). \n\nWe also had dessert and the portions were HUGE!

I've never gone out for Christmas dinner before, so I was worried that it was going to be super dead. As soon as we were seated, a server came around with a tray full of bread. There were a bunch of different kinds, pretzel, brioche, olive, wheat and my favorite cranberry bacon. The breads were served with rosemary and sun dried tomato infused oils and salted butter. My only complaint was that the breads were not warm and the server only came around once. Not that I needed any more bread, but had they come again, I probably would have taken one (or many) more of the bacon cranberry.\n\nMy mom and I decided to make a meal out of several apps. We started out with the butter lettuce salad and calamari. The butter lettuce salad was very good with a triangle of gooey fried brie. I thought the calamari was okay - not the best I've ever had, but I liked the curry aioli. Next up was the pumpkin gnocchi. The gnocchi itself was a bit sweet, but was offset nicely by the salty prosciutto and crunchy hazelnuts. We managed to only eat half of our flatbread with caramelized leeks, roasted garlic and chili. It made nice left overs for the next day. My grandma had the bouillabaisse which was full of mussels, shrimps, and scallops. I'm not a big seafood eater, but I this was delicious and the broth was so good sopped up with the pesto toasts.\n\nWe were pretty stuffed, but had to try dessert. The 3 of us split a huge tiramisu served in a mug. It was probably one of the best tiramisus I've ever had - not too sweet. We barely managed to make a dent in it!\n\nThe service was excellent and we were well taken care of all night. Prices were pretty reasonable too.

My brother had suggested this restaurant since my mom really likes seafood. I honestly never heard of this restaurant even though it was on Food Network or something like that. The restaurant is hidden in some business center, but usually the good restauants are a bit hidden. Once we got inside, we were seated right away. The decor is nice and mellow which is my kind of place.\nWe started off with the spicy chicken flat bread. It wasn't bad but it wasn't amazing. The calamari had a nice mustard sauce that wasn't over powering. The crab cakes were just ok.  \nThough my mom likes seafood, she decided to order the roasted half chicken. She described the chicken as having an amazing crust. It was very crispy while the meat was still juicy.\nI had ordered the halibut with spinch and cous cous. Like the chicken, the fish had a very nice crust while still maintaining its tenderness. The only downside is that the cous cous out shined the main dish. It had the perfect amount of seasoning and softness. The tomato halves added a sweetness and slight tart to the cous cous. You have to eat the halibut with the cous cous for the additional flavor, but the cous cous could be eaten alone.

Now, my friend takes forever to get ready and never can get anywhere on time- I think her moving around the reservations TWICE cuz she's not done with her hours long grooming ritual made the hostess upset. When we got there, the original was for outside and I was not feeling well so we were trying to sit inside instead. Hostess was definitely not friendly when she told us no. Given its probably annoying that we moved our reservation, but still you don't need to look so gravely annoyed. \n\nSo outside we went and I just hope for the best out of dinner. Thankfully it started to cool down as we sat there but I still had to go to the bathroom and make a cold compress.  Bread basket is good, but wtf is up with cold, just taken out of the fridge bread? They had a loaf that I loved, cranberry and bacon, but they really should ask people if they want it or not. We had someone in our table that cannot eat pork- a Muslim and also a vegetarian and they both bit into it thinking it's just cranberries and had to spit it out. (More for me!!) There was also a pretzel roll and a few slices of different wheat, sour, etc with two kinds of seasoned butter with a bit of oil on top: herb& oil and chili flakes&oil.\n\nMy friend grabbed some calamari for the table. It came with a few fried green beans and fried lemon slices (eat them- its actually good and not too tart) with a creamy curry sauce. The calamari was fresh though I would like more seasoning in the batter, it needed sauce. Maybe I'm just setting myself up to be disappointed since I love/crave the calamari at Herbs&Rye that is so flavor packed. \n\nBF and I wanted to share two things- a lamb bolognese tagliatelle with truffled riccota and a crab ravioli with cream sauce, peas, grape tomatoes and crimini mushrooms. Bolognese was very rich, but delicious. Definitely glad we chose to share so it can break up the flavor. I would normally love this thoroughly, but I'm sick (throat&ear infection, severe congestion, fever and nausea caused by the ear infection) so I needed something to lighten it. The flavorings and the use of pieces of lamb shank reminds me of osso bucco or a lamb tagine so great for fans of those dishes. The crab ravioli was generously stuffed with crab and was very fresh. we loved the combo of the flavors of this- good balance of some sweetness from a wine base and peas, some creaminess, richness of crimini and some fresh flavors with the herbs and fresh cut cherry tomatoes. My friend had a Mediterranean sea bass with a mix of squash and other veggies and her BF had skirt steak with sweet potato fries. They seemed to be very satisfied with their meal. We skipped dessert since we needed to drop them off to the strip, but looked good. \n\nIt was rather busy as our dinner went on. Service was okay, but not very attentive....we had to wait a while for a refill and sat a while to be noticed that our plates are done and we need the check.  We weren't neglected, but it wasn't the best. To me, it seemed that the guy was so busy though seeing him bustling about so maybe it means the establishment is spreading their staff too thin by giving them too many tables. \n\nOverall, we had a satisfying meal. I don't know if I'd come often because of the dinner prices isn't the most affordable to someone with piles of bills, but I think it's more of a place I'd come for drinks&appetizers or lunch. I do enjoy the atmosphere and maybe coming earlier would be a quieter, more attentive experience.", 'business_id': 'MXqmV0513hptrtjihDdf3Q', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2010-06-06', 'type': 'review'}

I\'m usually critical when it comes to hummus because I was brought up on it. This past my test because it had enough "zing " in it for me .

I took clients there and wanted to impress them. The service was bad from the moment we sat down.  Our server didn\'t bother to come over until about 10 minutes after we sat down (and the restaurant was less than half full).  He took our drink order, then disappeared.....   We were all wondering what the hell was going on, and he showed back up...15 minutes later...without drinks...and proceeded to ask us again what we wanted to drink...and spun it as "I just need to confirm your drink order".  Confirming our drink order took 15 minutes??????  So, after 30 minutes, we finally got our first drinks.  The rest of the evening was equally bad.  Poor service from our primary server became somewhat of a joke at our table...it was really ridiculous.  It gets WAY worse...wait for it...\n\nMy bill comes...it\'s $434.  I remember being happy that it wasn\'t over $500.  I figured that this guy definitely wasn\'t worth a 20% tip, but I would look like a cheap-skate with a 10% tip.  So, I figured on about a 15% tip...or $65, which is about $64 more than he deserved.  The final bill was $499 and change...and I was happy that I got out of there under $500.  I looked at my AMEX bill today and my total charge was $519.  That crappy server actually had the nerve to charge my card $20 more than I left him.  He must have felt entitled to my money.  This is credit card FRAUD!! \n\nI\'m not a snobby person...I eat out a lot...and I feel that I\'m fairly objective when it comes to evaluating service at restaurants. We didn\'t require more attention than a normal table of 6 people...we didn\'t complain, we didn\'t run this guy all around the restaurant...we simply ordered our food and waited for this joker to grace us with his presence.   \n\nThis waiter felt that I didn\'t tip him enough (for his horrible service), so he took it upon himself to STEAL money from me and commit credit card FRAUD.  I will not let this go and I demand my money back.  I realize it\'s only $20...but I don\'t care if I have to spend $1000...I will make this instance known and I will hold this crappy waiter accountable.\n\nI will never go to this restaurant again...I know it\'s not the restaurant\'s fault, it\'s probably an isolated incident, but I cannot justify theft and fraud in any capacity.  I\'m sure there are many, many more victims of this type of crime...but they don\'t bother to follow-up because the dollar amount is so low.  \n\nSuch a shame...such great food...but HORRIBLE service.  If I were the chef, then I\'d be up-in-arms about the service side of the business. \n\nHold these guys accountable...it\'s your duty as a consumer.', 'business_id': 'MXqmV0513hptrtjihDdf3Q', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2010-08-24', 'type': 'review'}

I first noticed the noise as I entered the well-hidden Summerlin spot. The restaurant was LOUD. Not loud with music, rather conversation. Since much of the restaurant is fitted in wood, the sound really carries; Vintner Grill is not a great date spot, though it does suit groups very well. It resembles many innocuous bistros you might find on the streets of Chicago, Manhattan, or any other large metropolitan area. \n\n\nTHE FOOD: \nI was a bit let down by the food. Vintner Grill is generally received well by guests, and came highly regarded to me by a coworker. \n\nI had a few selections from the cheese and Charcuterie menu which were good. The Petit Basque is a deliciously balanced, semi-soft cheese I highly recommend. \n\nI also had the calamari with a curried aioli, the Moroccan spiced lamb spareribs, and the honey truffled half-chicken. The calamari was flash fried, but a little too flashy. It was undercooked, and chewy. Calamari is a super easy dish to cook; it was disheartening to have such bad calamari at what some would call a fine dining establishment. The spare ribs were perfectly charred on the outside and seasoned well. Be aware that lamb spare ribs are a fatty cut before ordering. This is a good thing for people in the know. \n\nThe chicken was OUT OF THIS WORLD DELICIOUS! The skin was perfectly crispy without being overcooked. The meat was succulent and tender, but the flavor is what makes this literally THE BEST CHICKEN I HAVE EVER EATEN. The flavors married to form a symphony of pleasure. This chicken will put a smile on your face once the first nuance of flavor is detected by your taste buds. \n\nI can't agree with most reviewers on Vintner Grill, but I can tell you that the 1/2 chicken is a 5 Star dish, and reason enough to give this spot a go.", 'business_id': 'MXqmV0513hptrtjihDdf3Q', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2010-11-15', 'type': 'review'}

This place fit the bill.  I certainly am not one that is afraid, ashamed, or even bat an eye twice at the idea of dining alone, so I made a last minute reservation to check it out.\n\nWhat I immediately noticed was that I loved the overall design of the restaurant.  It is posh yet casual... almost like it doesn't take itself too seriously.  I also noticed the clientele.  Many people seemed to be out on a date-- or in one case I swear the guy was out with a mistress.  Others were discussing business.  It also was a nice touch to have from Here to Eternity playing in the background.\n\nWhen i walked in the hostess asked me if I was there to eat my favorite dish.  I told her that I hadn't eaten there before and figured there was no time like the present.  She smiled and said that I would enjoy it and took me to a table in the back corner.  My waitress was very thrown by the fact that I was dining alone.  It took her about 1/2 of my dining experience to adjust.  Everyone else on staff didn't mention it at all. In fact, they seemed unphased.  When I asked her what did she suggest as one of their best dishes on the menu, she couldn't give me an answer.  \n\nI started with a salad, which had artichoke and corn-- amongst other vegetables.  It was so fresh, and the corn was so sweet. The bread was better than average.  This definitely was one of the better salads that I have had in a long time.  For my main course I had beef stroganoff.  It was definitely the best version of this dish that I have eaten.  The hot tea was excellent, but my initial choice was not available and hadn't been for a bit according to the waitress.  If you are going to put your menu on a clipboard, can't you update it more frequently?\n\nAs at Rosemary's, my bottled water was kept on ice a stone's throw away from my table.  Here, however, they were on top of keeping it filled.  I still can't give this place 5 stars.  The service out of the main waitress was at best a 3.  Everything and everyone else was a 5.  I'd go back to grab some food and tea and relax.  I don't mind paying for a relaxing dining experience.", 'business_id': 'MXqmV0513hptrtjihDdf3Q', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2010-11-28', 'type': 'review'}

It's too bad it was a cold night because they have a really nice patio area with cabanas and fire pits, etc. but just a reason to go back when it warms up.  Our server was Josh and he took care of us!  His recommendations were spot on too.  There were 3 of us and we wanted to try a few things and shared family style.  The bread they bring you is fun: lots of choices like pretzel bread, black & green olive breads, cranberry, etc. and their butter/olive oil dip was yummy.  For appetizers we did their mix of cheese, salumi and fruit/jellies.  We stuck to the ones we knew like fontina, smoked cheddar and tried a goat's cheese purple haze that was quite good and not too strong.  Their Caesar salad is one of a kind, wrapped in prosciutto with the whole romaine heart and the dressing is really good.  I also had their butter lettuce salad with Brie and an orange/balsamic which was very good.   They had a parsnip soup on the menu that was quite good.  Their prosciutto flatbread was good, but we sent it back to get a little crispier.  Their NY Steak with Yukon potatoes and a port reduction was a good portion for all 3 of us to share along with all the other food and was cooked perfectly, only thing I would have asked for was more of a sauce on the side.

This is what the salad on the lunch menu at Simon is trying to be - exact at Simon they charge you $5 more for it, give you half as much food, and serve you sad little steak crumbles that are cold and dry. I love it when a place promises steak on a salad and delivers WARM steak. So important!!\n\nWe split the chicken for our main course. It was so delicious! Light honey flavor on the skin, and moist amazing chicken. I\'m not the world\'s biggest chicken fan, but this won me over!!

This hidden gem in Summerlin is perhaps one of the best local restaurants that Las Vegas and Summerlin have to offer.\n\nThe restaurant is a bit hard to find and located in an office building complex that catches you by surprise. Once you find the location, you walk past the most pleasantly decorated patio before you walk into the very metropolitan styled restaurant.\n\nFor starters, the Moroccan spiced lamb spare ribs with apricot glaze and carrot-almond slaw is an absolute must. The lamb is cooked to a perfect medium rare (and you should never ask it to be otherwise) and jammed packed with succulent flavor. \n\nThe risotto here is my go to entr\xe9e of choice. The pan seared diver scallops with shaved pecorino, heirloom tomato and sweet corn risotto is creamy, smooth, buttery, and everything you could possibly wish for. I found myself dissecting the perfectly cooked scallops into smaller and smaller pieces so I could savor the taste as long as I could.\n\nThe prime beef tenderloin with peppercorn sauce, brie potato puree and grilled asparagus is big enough to feed two and the brie potato puree rivals the steak itself as the high light of the dish.\n\nTo finish it off, any restaurant that can make a decent macaroni and cheese is all right in my book, and Vintner Grill offers a macaroni and cheese side dish that is absolutely to die for.\n\nThe tiramisu dessert comes in a giant cup but is never enough to satisfy.\n\nThe restaurant is oddly adaptable.

The ambience was nice as well.  Our reservation was at 630pm on a Friday night.  This place is west of the strip, so I'm glad I didn't have to run into freeway and Strip traffic, and the casino crowds.  Parking was easy to find and we were seated right away when we went in.  It started to get busy towards 730 or so.\n\nWe had the meats and cheeses selection for appetizers and decided on a combination of 2 meats and 3 types of cheeses.  The sliced duck was surprisingly good and the prosciutto was great.  The cheeses we selected (sorry forgot the specifics) was tasty as well, aside from the goat cheese.\n\nNow, the reason for my first comment above was that this was my night where my food picks were wrong, but everyone else I came with enjoyed their meals.  I got the lobster risotto, which was a special for the day.  Seeing enough Hell's Kitchen, where they offer risotto as a dish, I decided to give it a try. Plus, this was recommended by the waiter.  More often than not, when I rely on the waiter's recommendation, the dish turns out pretty good, but tonight was not the case.   First, I was expecting a lobster tail, maybe even a small one or half a tail.  But, all I got was a small claw and some rice for dinner.  So, I knew I was going to be starving.  Then, the risotti itself was bland and did not have much of a taste.  I bet you predicted I was asking my family to try their dishes during dinner.  haha.\n\nAs mentioned, the rest of my party enjoyed their selections.  My wife had osso buco and she enjoyed it pretty much.  It was a good size portion and she was pleased.  She savored the marrow last, which was still inside the bone.  My mother-in-law had the scallops and they were cooked just right.  My father-in-law had the bone-in ribeye and he enjoyed it very much.  He raved about how it was so good and soft the whole night.  I had a piece and it was pretty good.  He mentioned it was better than Ruth Chris and Flemings.  Hmm...Ruth Chris maybe, but it may be around Flemings caliber or a little under.  Then again, I just had a piece and he had the whole steak.  Next, my sister-in-law had Bouillabaisse.  She tried my risotto and agreed, no flavor.  She felt sorry for me and gave me a scallop, which was tasty.\n\nDessert time...  I had maple sugar creme brulee.  Creme brulee happens to be pretty high up on my dessert favorites.  It was pretty good, but the maple taste was a slight twist.  The maple taste reminded me of pancakes for breakfast.  Overall, I prefer the traditional creme brulee taste than the maple flavor, but would recommend others to try this dessert.  My wife had the lemon cheesecake and she thought it was one of the better cheesecakes she's had in a while.  Father-in-law was happy with his apple pie a-la mode, but we wasn't raving about it like he did with his rib-eye.  Mother and sister-in-law shared a dark chocolate dessert and they were really happy as well.\n\nGiven that we had an appetizer, a bottle of wine, dinner, and dessert, I was thinking at least $100 per head, but it turned out to be way less than that, which is definitely a plus.\n\nSo all-in-all, I got the wrong dish, but everyone else made the right selections.  With that said, I will definitely go back to this place for the service, ambience, and the fact that my family enjoyed their meals.  I just won't select lobster risotto ever.", 'business_id': 'MXqmV0513hptrtjihDdf3Q', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2011-03-26', 'type': 'review'}

There are a number of reasons why I absolutely adore Vintner Grill!  Let me count the ways:\n\n1. It\'s hidden in a office business park in Summerlin.  It\'s not like its out in the open; you gotta play eye-spy to find it.  And I like that!\n\n2. Their bar area is something that I feel that I could call home five nights a week.  It\'s very inviting and they have delicious drinks.\n\n3. The seating at the tables are super comfortable.  On the "booth" side- it is all white with gorgeous, comfortable pillows.  On the "chair" side- its a very comfortable, padded chair.  They make it comfy so you can enjoy your dinner.\n\n4. They don\'t rush you.  My husband and I were there for almost two hours and never once did the waiter try and get us out.  He gave us plenty of time and it was perfect.  If we needed him, he was always around.\n\n5. Their menu.  The first few pages is about their cheeses and meat selections that they have.  You know if they focus on this, it must be good.\n\n6. They play old black & white movies on this see-through glass that you would never expect to turn into a movie screen.  Very cool!\n\n7. The Bread Man- so after you get comfortable the "bread man" comes by with a many different selections of cold or room temperature bread.  You can have as many as you want!  They also bring out a dish with a couple dipping sauces and butter. (Suggestion- set the butter & sauce near the candle on the table, so the butter softens up!)\n\n8. The fresh and comfortable feeling that you get when just sitting in the restaurant.  It\'s white and crisp and lovely.\n\nOk, so my husband and I started with a glass of wine ($9) and a cocktail ($10) and after looking over the two page meat and cheeses we said "hell, we gotta try it!"  We asked our wonderful waiter for help.  Since my husband loves bleu cheese, that was one of the picks along with some salami and pancetta. (You can mix and match any meats and cheeses that you like!)  It came out on a plate with apricot mustard sauce and a homemade blueberry sauce.  OMG!  The bleu cheese with the blueberry sauce = amazeaballs!  So good!  The entire plate was delicious and something perfect to get our palette ready for the main courses.\n\nI had the bouillabaisse with mussels, clams, shrimp, snapper, calamari, scallops and saffron broth.  It\'s similar to a cioppino but even better!  The saffron broth had just enough flavor and it was plentiful of seafood!\n\nMy husband had the prime beef tenderloin with peppercorn sauce, brie potato puree and grilled asparagus.  He orders his steak cooked "between medium rare and medium" some places call it medium rare plus.  Comes out perfect every time!  He said that it was one of the best steaks he has ever had!\n\nEveryone in the restaurant seemed to enjoy their meals and the ambiance was definitely something that I enjoyed.  I\'m looking forward to bringing some family here later this month!', 'business_id': 'MXqmV0513hptrtjihDdf3Q', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2011-05-31', 'type': 'review'}

I made a reservation through Open Table which was very easy and when we arrived we were immediately seated.\n\nVintners is a little dark for my liking and some people were having trouble reading the menu, so flashlights were provided.

Looking at the address and being familiar with most restaurant locations in Vegas off of the strip, one would assume the entrance is facing directly onto Charleston Blvd, but you would be mistaken. Once you finally locate the entry amongst your standard setup of covered office parking spaces in the back, you enter a space rich with modern design and accessories. It might be a tad cluttered, but I really like the space and have always loved everything I've eaten for dinner. This is the first time I've been there for lunch, and jumped on the chance when I saw a burger on the menu. But did it stand up as well as the dinners I've eaten?\n\nThe short answer is no. As I said I've really never had any complaints about anything I've had for dinner, but I found several things wrong with this burger. First off, the bun to meat ratio was a bit too high, just more bun than I needed. It didn't help that it was quite dry and really distracted me from the meat...which in turn is a good thing, because even though I ordered it medium-rare as I always do, it was way over cooked. The burger was still surprisingly juicy even with it being more cooked than I'd like, yet by the time I got to the last few bites it was very dry. Overall the meat had little flavor to it, but the char flavor it did have on the outside was quite good. The bacon had a really great smoky flavor, and was cooked properly to have a nice crunch to it. The 'homemade' pickles also had great flavor, but were a bit lost in this burger.\n\nThe fries were another disappointment. Typically everything included with my meals at Vintner down to the sides are always great, yet these fries had very little flavor and just seemed a bit too uninspired. I would have expected a black truffle touch or something to them, but no such luck.\n\nOverall the burger did have good flavor, but the dry bun and boring fries didn't help the overall experience too much. While I wouldn't necessarily recommend going here for the burger, I would definitely recommend Vintner Grill any time as a great date spot or just to have a nice dinner.", 'business_id': 'MXqmV0513hptrtjihDdf3Q', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2011-08-22', 'type': 'review'}

The ambiance and decor ranks as the best looking restaurant off The Strip in my books. This place is dressed to impress.  Silent projector playing classic black and white movies at the entrance?? How cool are you and you\'re not even trying! \n\nYou know you\'re in for a good time when the bread basket and butter is good.

It really is unexpected to find a restaurant like this in an office park.  The place was busy (in a good kinda way) on a wednesday evening.  It looks like a hangout for the young professionals in Vegas.  \n\nSo the bar/lounge/waiting area is separated from the dining area of the restaurant with glass screens that play movies on both sides of them.  It was an old Humphrey Bogart movie called To Have and Have Not... "You know Steve, you\'re not very hard to figure, only at times. Sometimes I know exactly what you\'re going to say. Most of the time. The other times... the other times, you\'re just a stinker."  Anyway... so me, My T., Thao N, and Humphrey B., were seated at a table.  \n\nThe bread man came.  And it was served with butter.  By the way, you must go to this restaurant to see how the butter is served, never seen it done in this way.\n\nSo I had never had wild boar before... so we ordered some with cheese in the beginning.  And we also ordered a wild boar bolognese pasta.  I was a little freaked out at first, but my god, that was delicious.  There are a bunch of small plates, I can tell you what I got, but I would suggest just ordering what fits your needs.  I\'m a calamari, beet salad kinda guy.  \n\nHave fun!', 'business_id': 'MXqmV0513hptrtjihDdf3Q', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2011-09-01', 'type': 'review'}

I decided to give the place a try with its Restaurant Week menu and I was not disappointed.\n\nCourse 1 was crispy calamari with a lemon and curry aioli and some haricot verts.  The calamari was cooked perfectly and I liked that besides rings they had tentacles mixed in.  The lemon and curry aioli was a very tasty dipping sauce.  5/5\n\nCourse 2 was veal scaloppini with crimini mushrooms, lemon, marsala and capellini with olive oil.  The marsala sauce was superb in its richness and the crimini mushrooms added god flavor.  The capellini was a bit bland.  It needed some salt and for my taste a bit of grated cheese to bring out the richness of the olive oil.  4.5/5\n\nCourse 3 was a dessert of a gorgonzola panna cotta with a cherry compote and some sesame tuile.  The panna cotta was very light as it should be and had a mild flavor.  The cherry compote paired well with the lightness of the panna cotta.  The tuile was placed across the plate in the panna cotta.  Presentation was quite nice.\n\nThe restaurant is beautifully decorated.  I appreciate the fact that they start dinner service at 4.  I had a reservation for 4:30 as I needed to eat, run home and put my shorts back on, and head to a play at Spring Mountain Ranch State Park.  Service was excellent.  My server was polite and efficient.  The music loop was more for gray hairs like me.  The place was quiet, but it was early and there weren't many diners yet.  I do wish we could dispense with the TVs at the bar, but this is Las Vegas and almost any bar needs one or more TVs.", 'business_id': 'MXqmV0513hptrtjihDdf3Q', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2011-09-08', 'type': 'review'}

The food was just as good as any place on the Strip, and much less expensive!  Here\'s the skinny:\n\nCOCKTAILS: Martinis were nicely made, and the blue cheese stuffed olives are TO DIE FOR. \n\nAPPETIZER: I\'m not much of a "fish" fan (though I love sushi/shellfish), but the ahi tuna appetizer was ah-may-zing.  Very fresh, seasoned well, and I could\'ve literally licked the plate clean.\n\nENTREES: We decided to split two entrees: the crab stuffed ravioli and the veal scallopini.  As another yelper stated, the crab-stuffed ravioli was generously stuffed with crab.  I think, of the two entrees, this was probably my favorite, though the veal scallopini was pretty excellent as well.  \n\nWINE LIST: Simply out of this world!  There were so many options; you can definitely tell their sommelier knows his stuff.  There are options for smaller budgets, up to really large budgets.  We had a prosecco which was rather moderately priced, and it was delicious.  \n\nDECOR: Old Hollywood glam.  Reminds me of the Cosmo\'s decor in a lot of ways.  I loved the sleek white feel.\n\nSERVICE: The service here has gotten some lackluster reviews.  Our service was great; the server was extremely attentive.  We weren\'t rushed in any way, and every time we needed something, he was right there to help.\n\nThe one complaint - which is why I gave this place four stars - is that other than a "Happy Anniversary" as we were leaving the place, our special occasion wasn\'t even acknowledged.', 'business_id': 'MXqmV0513hptrtjihDdf3Q', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2011-10-03', 'type': 'review'}

After hearing many great reviews from friends, my fianc\xe9 and I decided to check it out for ourselves on NYE.  The location is low key and secluded, once you walk in...you\'re almost transported to an entirely different world.  The decor, the old black and white movies...you almost feel like a part of old world, glam Hollywood.  The hostesses were sweet, very nice...(had to ask guests a few times "you name again?") but again...very nice.  \n\nWe got a fabulous table right in the corner....the couch seating along the wall was awesome. I had a great view of the entire dining room and felt very comfortable even though the place was PACKED.  The bread offering was yummy, my favorites were the pretzel bread and bacon cranberry bread.  YES, I said bacon.  YUM.\n\nWhen we sat down, we were introduced to the special NYE menu that was being offered for the night...but we opted to order off the regular menu.\n\nFor our first course, we ordered a trio of "fromage and carne".  Cheese and meat.  The menu offers (and thoroughly introduces) all of their cheese offerings and different meats.  We got 2 cheeses recommended by our waiter and prosciutto.  The platter came with homemade blueberry jam, honey mustard, dried apricot, and the most DELICIOUS cheese crusted bread.  I had a pineapple martini with this course...it was good.  A nice sturdy martini with (what tasted like) real pineapple.  It wasn\'t syrup-y or too sweet.  Just right...a perfect starter for our meal.\n\nFor dinner, my fianc\xe9 had kobe steak. De-LICIOUS.  and if you\'ve never had kobe beef, may I PLEASE suggest you try it.  Truly, a cut of meat above and beyond all of the other fabulous cuts of meat out there.  I forget what his steak came with...but I do remember the plate being completely empty and him saying that it was "very very good".  I on the other hand was intrigued and oohing over every thing on the menu. I settled for the half chicken with lobster mac and cheese with broccolini.  Sounds good right?  It was okay.  I typically never order chicken...I wish I had ordered the scallops (which I spied on someone else\'s table...LOOKED YUMMY!!)...but I ordered it because I\'m a sucker for mac and cheese...and LOBSTER mac and cheese?  Forget it.  I was sold.  It was good..but again, I plan on returning to Vintner Grill to try MORE!  I had a caipirinha with my dinner...it was one of the best I\'ve had.  Even our waiter, who was from Brazil, said that theirs was one of the most authentic.  Sugarcane rum...can\'t beat it.\n\nWe finished off our meal with seriously the bet tiramisu I\'ve had.  I\'ve been "deserting" with tiramisu since a very young age.  And truly...I was and am impressed.  \n\nSo, in short...we are definitely going back.  There\'s also an amazing patio with a fire pit and twinkling lights that I want to enjoy once the weather warms.  And I urge you, my fellow yelpers, to check it out.  \n\nVintner Grill...you\'re pretty awesome.', 'business_id': 'MXqmV0513hptrtjihDdf3Q', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2012-01-02', 'type': 'review'}

It might be a toss up between Marche Bacchus and Vintner Grill. Thanks to some much needed vacation time between Christmas and New Years I had the pleasure of dining here for lunch on a weekday.\n\nThe place is hidden in an office park and doesn't look like much from the outside. But, as soon as you step in you'll feel like you've been transported to the some posh, elegant, urban metropolis. With its white couches and ceiling there's a airiness about the place despite little natural lighting. Black and green accents throughout the comfy interior add a modern touch. Of course you'll be reminded that you're still in Vegas when you see the video poker machines along the bar.\n\nLunch was excellent. There's a good selection of wines by the glass and the strawberry caipirinha shouldn't be missed. I'm a sucker for carbs and the bread basket they brought out didn't stand a chance. Among the selection was a brioche, pretzel bread, cranberry bread, and one with jalape\xf1os. They were accompanied by an olive tapenade.\n\nFollowing the bread basket was a cheese and meat platter ($25) with prosciutto, salami, a house-made camembert, goat gouda, Saint Andre triple creme cow's milk cheese. The triple creme was the standout among the cheeses. The salami had an almost jerky-like texture which I didn't care for. Their selection is an interesting mix of familiar and not so familiar items, some of which are house-made and seasonal. Your best bet is to tell the waiter your preferences and let him choose for you.\n\nTheir appetizers, flatbreads and some entrees are available as half orders, which is convenient if you want to try many things. We tried a half order of the pan seared crab cake ($8) with tarragon cream, roasted peppers and mache. The plating with the single crab cake sitting atop the cream sauce was beautiful and the flavors were equally as good. If you don't expect a Maryland style crab cake with jumbo lump meat (which this is not) you may be impressed.\n\nMy wife had a half order of the spicy chicken sausage flatbread ($7) with romesco sauce, leek confit, marjoram and truffled ricotta. A half order came as 4 slices. The crust was more chewy than crispy, but still tasty and generously topped with quality ingredients.\n\nMy dish was amazing -- the braised lamb bolognese ($11) with black pepper tagliatelli, truffled ricotta and fresh grated nutmeg. It wasn't the most visually appealing dish to look at, but it didn't last long enough for me to take a second look. Wonderful flavors with tender and savory chunks of lamb and fresh pasta. The dish is reason enough for a return visit.\n\nService was solid but a little stiff -- probably because they're used to serving dudes in suits most lunch shifts. No matter, I'd be glad to come back for dinner or have some small bites out on their patio when the weather warms up.\n\n4.5 Stars", 'business_id': 'MXqmV0513hptrtjihDdf3Q', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2012-01-07', 'type': 'review'}

Rather than using pear infused vodka, it actually had sandy pears blended in it. It was superb!!! The Mrs. got the strawberry caipirnha. It was pretty good, not too strong with more of a strawberry jam like flavor.\n\nAppetizers:\n\nmoroccan spiced lamb spare ribs with apricot glaze and carrot-almond slaw $13. It was so tender and rich. I would've been happy with that as a main course.\n\ncrispy calamari with haricot verts, lemon and curry aioli = Yelpers seemed to have inconsistent results with this, but ours was so tender! It was perfect with that curry aioli.\n\nwhite bean hummus with olive relish and spicy pita chips = It was crunchy grilled pita chips with plenty of olive relish, not enough hummus. \n\ntreviso caesar salad wrapped in prosciutto with egg and reggiano = not your traditional salad.\n\nBeet Salad = two types of beets was a nice touch. Perfect salad with the right amount of crunch from the toasted hazelnuts.\n\n\nEntrees:\n\nMoroccan braised lamb tagine with couscous. It stood out when the tagine was brought out steaming from the chimney and the lid was lifted. The lamb was rich and tender. It was a bit salty though. I felt like it should've been served with more couscous for at least 2 people to share. (I polished it off, but it took effort). \n\nDessert\n\nBlueberry - Meyer Lemon Cheesecake wasn't dense. It was so creamy. \n\nTiramisu = comes in a large coffee mug. It was fantastic! Instead of the traditional lady fingers. They use layers of chocolate cake. It was more about chocolate, then coffee notes, then the marsala. I personally like it in reverse order when I make tiramisu. But it was awesome.\n\nKeylime tart = wasn't a fan\n\nall the desserts are enough to be shared by two in my opinion. \n\nAs we were leaving, one couple's car, who had valet parked, was already waiting for them. Rather than handing a ticket and waiting like everywhere else, they paid attention to us leaving. We were all very impressed.

The first time the waiter said that they are very fragile glasses and most are broken, and the ones that weren't broken were being used. The second time the waiter told us that the glasses were expensive, most had been broken, and the owner didn't want to buy more of them. These two times were the last two times we've been, and I'm very dissapointed. It's a simple thing - BUY SOME BRANDY GLASSES PLEASE.

And that\'s my biggest criticism of the place. If you can find it, leave a trail of bread crumbs on your way home because you WILL want to go back!\n\nFrom the Blood Orange Cable Car (pre-dinner cocktail) to the Tiramisu, every course was outstanding. Though I had heard good things about the cheese course here, it was the only part of the meal that didn\'t knock my socks off. But the cheese list is so extensive I\'d be willing to give it another shot next time around. Maybe we will find something better suited to our taste. Next we had crab cakes and white bean hummus with pita. ROOKIE MISTAKE! This being a higher end eatery, we were expecting "Iron Chef" sized courses. But portions are generous so don\'t let your eyes get ahead of your tummy like we did. \n\nOur entrees came after a short wait (just enough time to let the first two courses settle). My girlfriend had chicken with mac and cheese. No kidding! Simple fare for a nice restaurant, huh? But they really made it pop. That pretty much describes the whole menu here. Nothing too cutting edge but top notch ingredients and preparation make every dish "to die for." I had the lamb tagine and it was perfect. As I told my girlfriend, this is my new favorite dish! Like the appetizers, entree portions were pretty huge. Every customer in the place left with a doggie bag. We left with two.\n\nDespite the fact that we were both STUFFED at this point, we could not pass up dessert. She had the banana, peanut butter, chocolate pie and I had the tiramisu. Both were light as a feather and richer than Scrooge McDuck! I don\'t know how they pulled that off, but SAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT!!\n\nI\'ve read reviews from others complaining of slow service, but that certainly was not our experience. We arrived 15 minutes before our reserved time (we heard it was hard to find so we started out early) but we were seated immediately. This is on the Sunday night before Valentine\'s. Granted our reservations were for 7 pm and there were several empty tables. Our server, Jeff, was a on top of things from the moment we sat down until the check was paid. We never felt rushed or neglected and he helped us with some wonderful suggestions. Even the bread server came around three times during the meal. The atmosphere was elegant but relaxed and very romantic. Overall, it was one of the best dining experiences we\'ve had in Las Vegas. I\'m patting myself on the back for finding Vintner Grill this Valentines! It might just become an annual tradition.

Eric had crown and ginger ale, and the bartender didn't skimp on the crown.\n\nWe started with the Chopped Salad - tasty, fresh and full of flavor.  We gobbled that up QUICK!  White Bean Hummus, when I think of Hummus, 'plain' comes to mind- however it was the addition of assorted chopped olives that brought it to life!  Then the bread guy stopped by with a half dozen to choose from- We had Olive Bread, pretzel bread, bacon cranberry and brioche- we had seconds!! \n\nEric ordered the Halibut- moist and tender.

It was super crowded, they didn't have it together, and we avoided it ever since.\n\nWe finally decided to give it another try.  We didn't have reservations, which apparently are necessary.  But they do have bar tables which are first come, first served.  So that worked out well.\n\nService was horrendously slow.  This had a lot to do with the fact that the bar area was serviced by cocktail servers in tiny black dresses and impossible high heels.  These poor women could only move in tiny little steps.  I was seriously concerned for their safety.  Also, there were some single diners, who seemed to be regulars, who were getting a lot more attention.  We never got bread service, which kind of sucked.  Everyone else in the bar seemed to. The bussers took our bread plates away after the first course anyway. The servers and bussers seemed frazzled for some reason. Finally, the bar was slow as hell and just strange.\n\nWe ordered two glasses of wine.  We saw them getting poured into tiny carafes.  Then they sat on the bar for a few minutes.  Then one of the carafes got poured out into the sink.  Another carafe was filled.  Then the carafes sat on the bar again for a minute or two. Then finally the whole carafes were poured into glasses and served to us.  Huh? Our second glasses of wine did not go through this process.  So I don't know what the hell was going on.  And the bartenders need to realize that they aren't invisible.  Stop screwing around. Especially when we want our damn drinks. If they were trying to get the wine to breathe, that ain't gonna do it.  \n\nFood was hit or miss.  The highlights were the vegetable chopped salad and the black truffle salami on the carne menu.  The vegetable chopped salad was really unique with lots of tasty vegetables and a nice parmesan cheese.  The black truffle salami was so creamy and truffley.  Gotta track that sucker down at Whole Foods!  We also tried proscuitto and another salami which were just ok.  But it is nice that they offer a make-your-own characuterie plate option.  They offered a variety of cheeses, too.\n\nThe risotto was meh.  Not very flavorful.  And the lamb terrine was searing hot so it took a while to even be edible.  Once it cooled down, it was ok.  Nothing great.\n\nThe north side of the bar had video poker machines, which I don't recall seeing on my first visit here.  No one was playing and, from what I observed, the machines just annoyed the people who wanted to eat and drink.  Video poker kind of makes sense given that this is owned by the same group as the Roadrunner taverns.  It kind of ruins the ambience, though.  Then again, most of the furniture and decorations seems IKEAish to me.\n\nSomething I could try again, maybe with a reservation and servers wearing proper footwear, but I won't be chomping at the bit to come here either.", 'business_id': 'MXqmV0513hptrtjihDdf3Q', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2012-04-08', 'type': 'review'}

The hostess and (i\'m guessing) the manager were extremely friendly as we walked in the hostess was pleasant and happy as she seated us.  It ended there.\n\nWe sat for another 15 minutes before our waiter actually came by.  Between that time, plenty of wait staff passed by or cleaned off tables, and no acknowledged us.  When he finally arrived, he took our drink orders and dropped off our menus.  It was close to another 10 minutes until our drinks arrived.  At which point we were still deciding on the dinner selections and asked for a couple more minutes to decide.  And we waited.  And waited some more.  A couple of minutes turned into another 10 and when he finally returned, he told us "we close at 9 so I have to take your order now".  Excuse me?  I was so taken back by the attitude, I actually forgot what I had decided on.  He didn\'t show any interest in speedy service, so why I should I be inclined to quickly order? \n\nOur food arrived in a timely manner and was very good.  We ordered the Crispy Half chicken, Butter Lettuce salad, Beet Salad and Barley Short rib soup.  However, with the salads, our server was way behind the curve with the pepper offering, we were halfway done.  But,they also make an excellent Moscow Mule so that makes up for something.\n\nAs we were clearly done with our meal, our server passed us by a few times over as he put out napkins at the surrounding tables and did his work to finish the night.  And after rushing us to order, offered us dessert or coffee to finish the meal.  But we already had decided that we didn\'t want to stay any longer and be ignored.

We ultimately got a great meal, earning this restaurant four stars.  The NY steak was excellent, perfectly cooked with the right amount of flavor and melting butter on top.  The crushed Yukon Gold potatoes were great and I appreciate our waitress telling me how good they were when I tried to sub them out. My daughter enjoyed her Dungeoness Crab Ravioli and some of my steak.  The portions were large and the main course price was high but not outrageous.  The chef was able to make the salmon without any butter for our guests.\n\nSo why are we missing a star?  Service, Service Service.  We had a 7:00 reservation, arrived at 6:55, did not get seated until 7:30 after waiting outside for 30 minutes.  We ordered a cheese platter right away and I love the cheese options including the vintner grill made cheeses. However, the tray arrived with the smallest slices of cheese I have ever seen and only three small slices of crustini.  We didn't even see a waitress to ask for more of the bread.  While we are on the subject of the bread, I remember last year having a large board of different breads brought out to the table to select from. Included on the board was a pretzel bread.  While waiting for our table I saw many diners enjoying the pretzel bread and was looking forward to it.  When we finally got to order at 8:00 and the bread still hadn't arrived we asked and the waitress brought us a small basket of raisin and nut breads.  When we inquired about the pretzel bread we were told they sold out a while ago (not true since people still were enjoying them at their table within plain view.) Now, I understand economics of restaurants and you can't always anticipate the demand and you have to err on the side of ordering or making too little rather than too many but really, Vintner Grill has been around long enough to know how many to make for Saturday night esepecially when they had a wedding taking up half the room.  And they weren't even at full capacity.\n\nI do like the butter which comes spread around a ramikin with two wells each containing a different herb or spice to flavor the butter.\n\nAfter the waitress made several minor but annoying errors on our drinks and appetizer orders, everyhthing settled in.  The wait for our food was very long and we were forced to listen to the longest best man toast at a wedding reception ever.  Even the guests looked bored to tears and the waiter with the cake was waiting over 10 minutes for him to finish.\n\nI still love this place but I seriously recommend going midweek when it will be less crowded and you can get 1000 point tables on opentable.  Saturdays they usually only give 100 points.\n\nIf anyone from Vintner reads this, my tip is give slightly more cheese and bread to put it on, have more pretzel bread, and give us a different waitress when we return next time.\n\nAs an aside, Andre Aggasi was there and is a frequent guest. We didn't talk to him because we didn't know he was there until the end but he does have a nice car!  Other celbs also dine here so have your cell phones ready if you are a celeb stalker.", 'business_id': 'MXqmV0513hptrtjihDdf3Q', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2012-06-10', 'type': 'review'}

So, I finally tried it Friday.  I was a bit concerned, as several yelpers had commented on the poor service.  I have to agree with them.  Although we were seated promptly, we had to wait a good while before a server came with a drink menu.  We then had to wait a good while to get our bottle of wine.  Although everyone was friendly, it's like they needed a few more servers on the floor.\n\nWe got a 5 piece charcuterie plate to start.  The 10 year aged cheddar was great, but only had 2 small pieces.  Our table had 4 people, and it was not enough for everyone to really get a good taste.  Some other cheeses (the blue for example) came with a lot more on the plate.  I understand that different cheeses have different prices, but I would have appreciated it had the server told us this cheddar is a small serving, so we could have ordered more or another selection.\n\nI had the porterhouses, which was okay, not great.  The star of the show in my estimation was the chicken and mac n cheese that one in our party had.  \n\nI will say the wine list was reasonable and diverse.\n\nI will not return unless someone else is paying.

This review will be on our most recent trip. There were four of us, one underage for drinking.\nThis restaurant is truly a gift to the summerlin part of Vegas, only wish they could more consistently pull it off.\nAtmosphere: the appearance of the grill may be one of its greatest strengths. It\'s located in an office park but offers valet parking. Once you leave the parking lot ou enter what appears to be a green and black oasis with outside seating in three sided tents that make even 90 degree days possible outside. Inside, is the appearance of a lounge with sofa like booths and pillows scattered among them. The reality is that sitting in those booths is uncomfortable, pick a chair.  There is a large bar and bar table seating area when you enter.\nService: We were greeted and seated quickly and our waiter quickly introduced himself. Immediately he was very familiar, wanting to call us by our first names and acting like we were buddies. This is not a style of service we desired, so this was an irritating factor that got increasingly irritating. When the waiter said to our underage diner, "go ahead and order a drink, I won\'t tell." we were less than happy, but he thought it was funny.\nFood:  we started with a combination cheese charcuterie platter and some cocktails. You select as many cheeses as you desire from a long and very interesting list divided by type of milk. This list is truly a strength. Then there is a selection of charcuterie including boar and elk. We tried both and they were good. The cheeses were all good. They are served with some dried fruit, crackers and honey.  The mains were all fine but way too much going on.  It was hard to decipher any particular flavor. I had the ravioli, which is a very small serving of several raviolis that are a bit hard in the edges. One of us had a dish with apricots where the apricots were clearly not ripe and had no flavor. In fact, we didn\'t believe they were apricots except that is what the menu said. They have several distinct cocktails but some good old fashioned cocktails would have been appreciated.\nWhen we left the waiter said, "can I call you bob" when he saw the credit card. Just too much familiarity. This is a restaurant with hits and misses. Stick to the simpler things for better chance of getting the hits.', 'business_id': 'MXqmV0513hptrtjihDdf3Q', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2012-09-09', 'type': 'review'}

When the waiter came by, we ordered a bottle of spanish wine (Tempranillo).   Now I don't claim to be a wine connoisseur, but I know what I like to drink but am willing to keep an open mind when a recommendation is made.  So we listened when the waiter recommended a red zinfendel instead, but thought it was strange since he threw out the recommendation without getting a sense of what we planned to order.  We decided against his recommendation, and that's when he began to insult our wine selection claiming it was too earthy (we ordered a tempranillo....ummmm they're supposed to be earthy).  I was not happy with this behavior, but my friend figured there must be a reason, and maybe we should at least give the zin a taste.  So we asked if we could taste the Zin before committing to a bottle.  Our waiter came back with an unopened bottle and 2 glasses, we had only asked for a tasting.  So we made it clear to him again, that we only wanted to taste the wine, and we didn't want him to open the bottle because we weren't sure if we wanted a bottle of Zinfindel.  He assured us that it would be no problem and he was certain we would like the Zinfindel.  Well....we tried it....and I'm sure other people like Zinfindel's, but this one was extremely dry and tart.  My friend and I looked at each other and knew this was not what we wanted.  So we told the waiter, we'd like to stick with the Tempranillo.  Our waiter looked really upset,  after that he brought us our original selection but didn't seem very amicable.  It made the atmosphere and dining experience awkward, which we didn't want.  He seemed a little friendlier later on, but dealing with wine issue was not pleasant.  We were sitting near the register and noticed that they were selling a lot of Zinfindel....so maybe they were trying to get rid of a case.\n\nFood:  \nThe quality of the food was not consistent. Here's the breakdown, out of 5:\nCheese plate - 5 \nGoat cheese/hazelnut salad - 5 - paired different flavors that worked really well together\nscallops -  2  - too salty and there was some sand on the scallops so it ended up having a grainy taste; I couldn't finish it\nBeef Tenderloin - 2 - my friend ordered this and he didn't seem too enthusiastic about his plate either, he also didn't finish his plate.\nBlueberry Lemon cheesecake - 5\n\n\nThis isn't a restaurant on the Strip, but it's not cheap either.  We paid $165 for 2 with tip, and overall the level of service and food quality were not on par to what I would expect from a restaurant of this caliber.", 'business_id': 'MXqmV0513hptrtjihDdf3Q', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2012-09-11', 'type': 'review'}

Greg constantly checked on us without being over bearing and ensured our cocktails/wine were always filled. \n\nWhile some of the seating arrangements appeared to be close to one another, the conversation you have with your guest weren\'t interrupted with neighboring guests.\n\nThere are so many items to select off the menu and each is delicious depending on what you happen to be in the mood for. I have enjoyed the halibut, the free-range chicken, the prime beef tenderloin and the lobster cannelloni on various visits and I look forward to expanding my cravings to the other items featured.\n\nThe price you pay for an incredible evening here is substantially less than a place on The Strip, and the service is so far above most dining establishments.\n\nIf you want to impress your guest or just pamper yourself with food, drink and attentive service then visit Vintner Grill....and often!', 'business_id': 'MXqmV0513hptrtjihDdf3Q', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2012-10-11', 'type': 'review'}

I first spotted the outside patio area, it was very Miami, white curtains flowing, comfy patio furniture, there was a wedding party there and it looked so fashionable, like out of a magazine. The inside decor was a mixture of contemporary/modern Pottery Barn-esque with a splash of beach feel, I liked the little nooks built into the wall, it was like just a little bit of Morocco thrown in as well. Ok onto the food, the first time I went there I did a cheese board and some wine, they have a great cheese selection and I really enjoyed my order. Second time I had split 2 entrees with my friend so we could try both, we ordered the halibut with cous cous, spinach, toasted orzo, lemon gremolata and sweet tomatoes, I politely asked if they could hold the butter, and the server was very nice, didn't give me a hard time, this dish was wonderful, halibut was cooked to perfection, definitely recommend, the show stopper though was the bouillabaisse with mussels, clams, shrimp, snapper, calamari, scallops and saffron broth. This was so delicious, comparable to cioppino, but the saffron broth gave it a different twist. The calamari was outstanding. Service was outstanding, our server was very attentive, my water glass was never empty, they continually came around to give you more bread, oh the bread....awesome bread basket....carb addicts dream.

Not me.  I must have driven by this place a hundred times and never knew it was there until a friend recommended it to me. It was a last minute decision to eat there when my date said I could pick anywhere, so I did.  Reservations were made on the Yelp site (easy as pie) 2 hours before our arrival last Saturday with no problem. There's a nice ambiance to the place.  There's an outdoor area complete with heaters and a large fire pit.  Inside, there are comfortable chairs and ottomans for the diners waiting for a table. A classic James (Sean Connery) Bond movie was playing on the flat screens with the sound off in the dining area-I thought it was kinda cool.  For starters, we had the chevre goat cheese.  Good stuff!  My only complaint would be that we needed more of the toast that was served with the cheese because we only got three pieces.  The bread service was interesting with a server coming to the table with a platter of different selections for you to choose from and doling out pieces as requested.  I didn't realize the butter for the bread was on the table because of the dim lighting; it looked like a rectangular plate with two different kinds of olive oil.  In actuality, it was a slab of butter with two scoops created for the olive oil.  Of the bread selections, I went with a pretzel-like one and the wheat rolls; I'd rather have the bread warm, but no big deal.  We had the crab cakes appetizer, one for each of us and they were good.  By the time my actual entree came, the Free Range Half Chicken with Mac n Cheese, I was kind of full.  I only ate a quarter of the chicken, but all of the mac n cheese, which was just okay.  Our waiter was fairly attentive throughout the meal and then he disappeared at the end.  Overall, it was a nice dining experience in a cool space.  I'd definitely recommend it for a special occasion.", 'business_id': 'MXqmV0513hptrtjihDdf3Q', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2012-11-12', 'type': 'review'}

So, if someone at OpenTable see's this review, get your act together.\n\nOk, now on to the important stuff.\n\nFood, very good. I had the hummus, and then a flatbread (pizza type). They have a guy who comes around with about 10 different styles of bread. At the table, the butter is actually shaped as a dish, and has two indents. One contains olive oil, the other...I forgot, but it was good. It's hard to describe. And no, I didn't take a picture. The butter dish thing is also covered in sea salt and pepper for added goodness.\n\nThe menu is a bit uncomfortable. The first two pages are just meats and cheeses. The menu is a bit confusing and overwhelming.\n\nOur server seemed to give us a little attitude when we asked questions about how the first two pages of the menu worked. He then went into a routine about the menu, specials, etc. It was very rehearsed and the conversation didn't really feel natural. It didn't feel like he was offering or sharing any useful info. This is the only reason why I say it was a 3.5 star experience.\n\nAlso, when I had some leftovers, I asked for a box.

Me:  "We didn\'t get them.....again....."   Her:  "Ha, ha, wow I swear I think I forgot to give him the order. What are you drinking ?"  She had no clue. Her boobs were ginormusly huge.

This is a hard restaurant to review. I absolutely loved many things about this place, but there are definitely some aspects I think they could improve upon.\n\nThe decor, the lighting, the free valet parking, the comfortable seating all scream luxury, yet with an air of comfort and homie-ness. The staff matched that with their warmth and friendliness. Our server did a good job. Not fantastic, but good. The service seemed to get a little lazy at the end.\n\nThe first two courses were terrific. We started with cheese (faux pas!). The sheep\'s milk petite basque was sharp and mildly pungent. The truffled ricotta was creamy and luxurious. Both were delightful with the homemade strawberry and apricot mustard jams they were served beside. We also had the venison salami which was good but nothing special.\n\nI judge crab cakes based on what they are garnished with (since they all taste about the same to me). This variation has a beautiful, creamy tarragon vinaigrette, some peppery greens and a tangy,  sweet roasted bell pepper relish. The combination was divine.\n\nThe baby gem "wedge" salad was also a refreshing combination of flavors: tender baby gem lettuce, with large chunks of piquant blue cheese, salty and crispy pancetta, sweet poached pears, tomatoes and a blue cheese-bacon dressing.\n\nThe main courses were decent. Jen got the saut\xe9ed salmon. It was cooked to a perfect medium rare and was quite fresh tasting, though overly salted. The lobster sauce was decadent and creamy. The mashed potatoes were a little cold and had a strange tasting spice in them (maybe cardamom?).\n\nI had the roasted, boneless half chicken with truffle glaze and cavatelli served "Mac and cheese" style. The skin was perfectly crispy and the glaze was sweet and luxurious. Unfortunately, the chicken itself was a little dry (as it tends to be if not brined). The cavatelli, though creamy and cheesy needed some salt. It was also served with some broccolini that was still very crunchy.\n\nDespite its minor faults to an otherwise lovely dining experience, I enjoyed this place and will be back.', 'business_id': 'MXqmV0513hptrtjihDdf3Q', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2013-03-13', 'type': 'review'}

This was a last minute substitution because our intended restaurant was closed on Sunday- Monday. It must be divine intervention! I would have missed out on this amazing journey.\n\nFrom start to finish it was a splendid experience. A friend and I came directly after work. We got there half an hour early for our reservation and sat at the bar. I tried the Capone's Rye. It is one of those cocktails that gets more intense the longer it sits. As it adjusted in temperature, the more I can taste all of the alcohol. It is a true martini in nature. All alcohol and very little filler. Rye whiskeys are making a comeback and I want to get into them. Maybe next time I will take baby steps. One cocktail was more than enough for me. \n\nWhen our third person came, we were sat promptly. We decided to all do the special menu. The online version made it seem like the diner had to choose between three set menus. When looking at the paper, it is all presented as a mix and match of your liking. We decided to skip the beef barley soup and opted for two pumpkin gnocchis and the wedge salad. Smartest move EVER! The gnocchi was hands down the best dish of the night. Our server was considerate enough to split anything that could be divided. The pumpkin gnocchi tasted like fall. All the traditional spices; cinnamon and nutmeg is present in them. The proscuitto and blue cheese added a nice saltiness. The bitterness from the arugula gave the dish a nice contrast in texture. The same could be said about the roasted hazelnuts. Sweetness came in the form of poached pears. The wedge salad was also very good. Just not as good as the gnocchi. In hindsight, we should have all just got our own plate of that.\n\nWe then ordered one of each entree. The truffle glazed chicken had a beautifully brown and crisp skin. The glaze is slightly sweet and complimented the savory mac and cheese well. I was shocked by how moist the chicken was. The steak over a bed of pureed parsnip was decent. The veggies and parsnip was my favorite part. Why not puree other root vegetables? Especially sweet ones. Potatoes are a thing of the past. The halibut was also another item I was thoroughly impressed with. It was cooked to perfection. The outside seared crispy and the center moist. I devoured my piece and the couscous within minutes of it hitting my plate.\n\nOne of my dining companions and I was not as enthusiastic about the desserts. All of them were not seasonal selections. They had a berry theme to them, They were still decent. We were so stuffed by this point that it did not even matter. The trifle with strawberries was the highlight offering. The lemon blueberry cheesecake was second. The panacotta had too much gelatin in it. It was stiff.", 'business_id': 'MXqmV0513hptrtjihDdf3Q', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2013-03-14', 'type': 'review'}

I came back in 10 min later to ask if we could wait inside or if we can sit where a bar server could take our drink order. She said to go outside. Another 15 minutes...Another inquiry and 15 minutes...Still nobody.  She\'s like huh? What\'s your name? As we stood at the front door (because we were cold) with no drink a group of 8 came in asking about the place and if they could eat there etc. or get a reservation to be seated. The hostess said no reservation needed and she could seat them in 5 minutes. Um, hello?  After overhearing this I said that we were still waiting we had a reservation - She goes, "What\'s your name again?"  When I asked how long she said she didn\'t know.  Observation - LIttle girls who have no people skills shouldn\'t be working at an establishment without proper supervision.  She then was super confused (why? there was nobody else waiting - she kept seating everyone immediately that came in....)  then said she didn\'t know if we could get a table yet.. When asked why the party of 6 was able to get seat when they walked in she said they had reservations. LIAR. ...Liar panties on FIRE. I am not sure why the game playing or unorganized servers. But, we sat at the table in the bar area. Food was okay. It was so dark even with my phone light I couldn\'t read the menu. I observed how this place was working and it seems like those who knew her and she knew their names were getting seated asap.

Seeking we did. It's an interesting location set inside an office park. Upon entering we were quite surprised and felt a little underdressed. That feeling was quickly quashed as soon as I saw the video poker machines embedded into a portion of the bar. Never can seem to escape the gambling!!\n\nThe setting has a South Beach feel to it, removing you from the fact that you're in an office Park. Sitting at the bar you can very well see there was some thought put into the space. There is a beautiful outdoor space with a lounge type of feel. A private dining area with a beautiful wine display, and comfortable banquet seating with pillows. I'm a sucker for a place that plays black & white movies on the tv screen too. It's tablecloth dining with sharp dressed waiter and bartenders. And an nice open kitchen to let you peak into the heart of the cooking. Sounds nice right?\n\nBut then the disaster started. Service was so disappointing. They sat us at a table right next to the server computer station, why would you even have a table there in the first place? We made the best of it, there were pillows so I thought-can't be that bad?! \n\nWell it was. I'm not trying to throw anyone under the bus but its easy to see this place lacks any management. I don't think I could even see one around. Water was poured into our old iced tea glass and throughout the dining experience glasses were left empty right until we got the bill. I requested water without ice and repeatedly had ice in my glass. Mistakes happen yes, but then the waiter berated the busboy so close to our table. It made us feel so uncomfortable.\n\nPositive: The food! Portions are manageable and priced well. The meat is cooked to the perfect temprature and all the fixings were seasoned so well. They have a pleasant winelist with familiar choices and I feel all the prices are relflective to the setting. I think it makes a great date spot. Just make them seat you far away from the waiter's computer station.\n\nI'm not inclined to return anytime soon as the experience left a bad taste in my mouth. But I would have to say its worth a look-see for anyone venturing to this part of Summerlin and looking for a nice setting to dine in with well executed cuisine.

We ordered a couple of glasses of wine and decided on an appetizer.  In the past, we have ordered cheese plates but we decided to order:\n\n*Crispy calamari with haricot verts, lemon and curry aioli ($12)\n\nI wish we didn\'t order it.  It was rubbery and the aioli had a very strange flavor.  After eating two rings of calamari, I had enough of the rubber.  Surprisingly enough, the waiter never asked how the appetizer was. \n\nBut he did come over to ask what we wanted as a main course.  I\'m guessing there weren\'t any specials of the night, since it was never offered.\n\nI ordered:\n*Seared sea scallops with saffron risotto, english peas, fennel, pea sprouts and roasted pepper relish ($31)\n-The scallops were MASSIVE and very good.  But the risotto tasted like a box of rice-a-roni (yuck!)  The roasted pepper relish that was on top of each scallop was unnecessary as it caused the inside of the scallops to turn pink, which then makes you think, "could this be raw inside?"\n\nMy husband ordered:\n*Durham ranch wagyu sirloin with parsnip puree, baby vegetables and balsamic-port reduction ($27)\n-He said it was good, but the wagyu at T-Bones at Red Rock (if you can believe it!) was MUCH better.  In fact any wagyu that he has had anywhere else was better than this.\n\nWe ordered our dessert to go:\nWhich was a trifle with granola, strawberries and pound cake.  It was yummy!\n\nThere are restaurants in the area that have better food; the ambiance at Vintner Grill is terrific- but that is what you are paying for.\n\nUnfortunately, I am no longer a fan and will not be visiting anymore.

Finally made it around to having dinner here last Saturday. It is tucked away in an office complex off Charleston. The entry is unassuming and easy to miss.\nThe decor is upscale chic modern. We were seated right away as we made reservations from Open Table off Yelp.\nThe clientele that night seemed to be predominantly retiree age with a few scattered specks of youth. Our observation was that most of the women in there looked miserable. (You can marry for money but it doesn\'t buy happiness). You must come dressed up here or feel dramatically out of place amidst the money crowd. Luckily we came prepared.\nIt took a while for someone to finally come over to bring us a menu and take drink orders. The cocktail menu consisted of old timer favorites with modern ingredients. For such a fancy place, they could have utilized a classier menu holder, rather than a plain clipboard.\nThe selections seemed standard when comparing to previous posts of the menu with some slight changes. One of our favorite things was the butter dish with wells of infused olive oil...a welcomed forbidden treat after a week of "clean eating". The bread selection was very nice as well...get the brioche and try the cranberry bacon loaf. We each ordered the butter lettuce salad with warm Brie. The salad was a little difficult to eat because of large leaves but the encrusted Brie was good.\nI ordered the Mediterranean sea bass with haricot vert (French baby green beans), potatoes and chopped olives. The fish was fresh and light just like a sea bass should be, the veges were a nice accompaniment and retained their crispness. My wife ordered the veal scallopini with angel hair pasta. I tried some and it was delicious. Lean, thin veal cutlets in a wonderful marsala sauce. I would order that the next time. The wine was a Malbec that was smooth and light. They bring the bottle to the table to pour. The waiter seemed a bit too touchy feely for our comfort but not too creepy lol. Service was slow at some points.

Vintner Grill is in a business complex and can be easy to miss, but you will not want to. I was surprised upon entering VG, it had  a modern beach feel to it. The patio chairs were very roomy, comfortable and had pillows. If eating inside isn\'t your thing they have cabanas outside, but only a couple so if you want to make sure and get one it would be best to make a reservation. \n\nIf cheese & wine are your thing then VG is the place for you! They have a selection of over 400 wines from different countries. They also offer 30 different beers from around the world. When it comes to the cheese, the menu says VG has one of the largest selections of cheese in Las Vegas! They also have a nice selection of house cured meats. If you are interested in buying their cheese online instead of at the restaurant you can go to the following website http://vgcheese.3dcartstores.com/ to place your order.\n\nOut server checked on us often and was very nice. A man came around with a bread tray and offered us a complimentary variety of breads and left some butter and oil on the table. The bread was delicious, but it would be easy to fill up on this stuff so I just had a few bites. After looking over the menu it was hard to decide since so many things sounded tasty. I chose the "Classic Cobb W/Grilled Beef Tenderloin Salad" that had a bacon-blue cheese vinaigrette. This salad priced at $14 and had green onion, hard boiled eggs, hearty blue cheese crumbles, fresh greens and of course the beef tenderloin. The vinaigrette was so good! The beef was cooked perfect, tender and flavorful.  I couldn\'t stop eating this salad it was just so good. All of the flavors meshed well together and I will happily order it again! I was having lunch with a friend who ordered the "Grilled Lemon-Marjoram Chicken Salad" also priced at $14 and she enjoyed it. \n\nVintner Grill is the perfect place to have lunch with a friend, date night with that special someone, or celebrate an occasion with family and friends.

Tucked into the back of an office park (really) one comes through the back parking lot into..... "Voila!"  Valet parking, white linen table cloths, outdoor fire pits in a tiered outdoor dining landscape, white tented private dining areas - and then a beautiful long bar inside with more great seating, white leather booths, more.  If you were dropped into this spot with no clue where you were, you would guess Miami Beach.  \n\nUpscale, fantastic wines, good service and an interesting crowd that is mostly 40-60-ish early in the evening and then becomes the hip spot for the upscale younger crowd until the last hour of the evening when it again calms down and people stop for a nightcap or dessert on the way home from a show, the Strip, whatever.  \n\nBut great people-watching and always good conversation with some fascinating person/people when I go there to eat at the bar, and I often do go alone.  Food is quite good, although I would say there are places in Summerlin where the food is just as good, perhaps even better, and it would cost you 25-50% less. So you\'re paying for extraordinary ambiance (relatively speaking).  However, if you are out at the Red Rock Resort (or the JW Marriott) in Summerlin and want to do something fun and different one night - or if you\'re a local - this is something a little different, and in my opinion, worth it.', 'business_id': 'MXqmV0513hptrtjihDdf3Q', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2014-02-14', 'type': 'review'}

This establishment is definitely overrated but a nice meal can be found here. \n\nTwo stars lost for lack of service and overall experience our server Jim was  inattentive and left us asking for water, bread, and the check from other waiters, busboys whomever we could find. While seated outside we saw a rat in the bushes behind one of their covered seating areas within the walls of the patio it was a bit alarming but I told myself we were outdoors and that can happen. (Wishful thinking) Really I didn't want to ruin our meal. It was there the entire time. When we were leaving I went to put my hand on the railing and there was a roach on it yuck!\nThe food was ok nothing to rave about. \n\nOne star- very pretty indoor space however the outdoor space is where you want to sit. Lanterns hung from trees and candlelight it's very inviting. Cons they have one tree that isn't lit according to the server it hasn't been for a while, while sitting by this tree it became extremely difficult to see even the servers made comments as they brought our food about how dark it was. \nNevertheless it felt romantic. \n\nOne Star- Food. We started out with a cheese and meat pairing. I went safe with the cheese as the waiter really had no suggestions to offer us. We chose the Fontina with prosciutto and venison salami this was pretty good the meats were the star of the show I wish I chose a sharper cheese but I was still happy. My husband really liked the accompanying jams that came with the plate that was his favorite part of the meal. The calamari was well cooked  however the curry aioli was a little overwhelming and took away the freshness of the dish. I ordered the veal scaloppine and he ordered the NY strip. My veal was mediocre nothing really outstanding about the dish and the pasta was similar to a dish a make at home nothing special. My husband ordered his steak medium rare, it came out medium/medium well. He was not happy. For dessert we ordered two espressos and the Turkish cheesecake. This was my favorite part of the meal mainly because of the honey they served  with the cake was a small piece of a honeycomb. The honey and the blueberry jam were the best parts of the entire meal. \n\nOne star- Overall it was a nice meal, we would probably go back for the ambiance drinks and appetizers.", 'business_id': 'MXqmV0513hptrtjihDdf3Q', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2014-04-14', 'type': 'review'}

Cute patio to the left with cabana, string lights, and posh furnishing as you walk towards this randomly placed restaurant. Once you go through the doors, you walk into a cute waiting area with a black and white film playing against the walls. The hostess was on the phone as we entered so we thought we'd enjoy the time to just appreciate the decor. She hangs up, and then the phone rings again and she takes it. Doesn't bother us too much cause we were still fascinated by the casual elegance and continuing on with our conversation. Then she hangs up the phone once more and of course, the phone rings again and she picks it up. Okay now we're mad. HI, DID I FORGET TO TAKE MY INVISIBILITY CLOAK OFF IN THE CAR OR SOMETHING? So lucky us the manager was walking towards the stand and we knew we would soon be sat. NOOOPE. He was watching her talk on the phone and then looked down at the books while I was still standing there with no acknowledgement of me and my guest at all until I said the first hello. OH ALL OF A SUDDEN I APPEARED and he sat us. \n\nIt took awhile for the server to come greet us and I was getting irritated to the point that I was ready to place the total tip on the table and slowly take each dollar away so they can visually see how much they are sucking! Sorry, but it was our anniversary dinner (which they were informed of) so I was really hoping for a special experience! This review has moved down to two stars at this point.  Anyway the server finally noticed us and took our order. My boyfriend ordered a glass of McCallan 18 neat and it took them 20 minutes to get it to him, AFTER I reminded the server at the 15 minute mark. I mean, come on, you literally just open the bottle and pour it in the glass. It takes 10 seconds, probably even less. So we're obviously VERY frustrated at this point. To add to this horrible experience, the server is standing in front of our table and starts making comments about killing some guy in the restaurant and bad mouthing him like crazy to another employee. ARE WE ON MYSTERY DINERS?? Cause this service just seems so dramatically terrible. \n\nLuckily this place offers some tasty looking entrees that are decently priced. We started with salads - the caesar ($10) and the house ($9.50). I know caesar salads are simple, but I absolutely loved it here! It was basically a wedge of romaine lettuce wrapped with prosciutto and stuffed with three long bread sticks. Simple but very delicious. For the main entree, I went with the veal and angel hair pasta dish ($32) and the boyfriend went with the honey glazed chicken ($22). Skip the veal and go for the chicken! \n\nDuring our meal, the server came by and apologized for his manner earlier and that he didn't mean for us to hear all his negative comments. Okay, that's nice, but that doesn't excuse anything honestly. It's not hard to keep your opinions to yourself or at least go into a back room to vent if needed. \n\nBack to 3 stars ONLY because I actually enjoyed the food. Overall I would possibly consider returning because the flatbreads looked worth trying, but I feel like I would really have to grit my teeth on making the effort because the service was extremely lacking...", 'business_id': 'MXqmV0513hptrtjihDdf3Q', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2014-05-07', 'type': 'review'}

Did he offer to move us to a difference table or change the table cloth??? NO WAY, instead he quickly said "sorry" and took off to the kitchen.  \n* I thought he would return with a new drink, to my surprise he returned with the appetizers we had order. \n* Appetizers really sucked, my Italian wedding soup was very salty.  \n* My GF got a burnt steak for dinner, her mom\'s raviolis were OK\n* The Tiramisu basically had a giant thick hard/old brownie in the middle\nBetween drinks and food the bill was about $300, I was so pissed off that my tip to the waiter was "better service". \nOn our way out we looked for the manager to let him know of the poor service, but saw that he was too busy chatting up the hostess in a corner.

No welcome, no introduction, nothing. Just what can I get you to drink. Because we didn't order any alcoholic beverages, I feel the waiter put us on the back burner.

We all got three different appetizers and entrees. I wasn't expecting to wait as long as I did for the courses. Seemed that the kitchen wasn't prepared to put out the menu they had running. The dishes arrived at all different times for each course.. Leaving the family waiting once again to eat. The halibut had no sauce, leaving it dry. The lamb was chewy and almost tough on the outside.

Definitely a chic atmosphere and a variety of meals (basic starters, wood-fired flatbreads, pasta&risotto, entrees, prime wood-grill).  \n\nFood was delicious, but more importantly: they claim to have one of the largest selections of cheeses in Las Vegas. Along with hand-selected and house cured meats. Need I say more? *wiping drool off* Since it\'s not "acceptable" to bathe in a tub of cheese, this might be the next best thing. Order a bunch of fancy smelly cheese that will make you feel like you\'re in France. Since I was with a party of people I tried an assortment of dishes, all being flavorful. \n\nThe only reason I don\'t give it 5 stars is because the service was slow and they took a long time to accommodate extra people that joined, despite it being a quick and easy fix.  \n\nGood news for those farther from Summerlin, they opened one on the Strip! They are also open for lunch.', 'business_id': 'MXqmV0513hptrtjihDdf3Q', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2014-05-14', 'type': 'review'}

And after my extensive contemplation, I am confident in saying that this was a five-star experience. If the criteria for five stars is "as good as it gets" then I\'d say without reservation that Vintner Grill is as good as Vegas gets. \n\nHere\'s the breakdown\n\nAMBIANCE: 5\nFOOD TASTE/QUALITY: 5\nFOOD CREATIVITY: 4\nSERVICE: 4.5\n\nOverall, what I like about Vintner Grill was that it delivered on providing an experience. And there are are not many places in this town (off-strip) that even attempt to do that. The overall aesthetic is a modern take on a light Art Deco/1930s decor. Everything from the black and white checkered floor to the white and pastel green color scheme worked to set a mood from the moment you walk in. If you\'re reading other reviews, you already know the restaurant is located inside a business center--and it\'s that very juxtaposition between the bland stucco sameness of the business center and soft, light and glossy interior of the restaurant that left me feeling transported. The contrast of the business center location totally works in Vintner Grill\'s favor by creating an immediate expectation of luxury and quality. And Vintner delivers on both fronts.\n\nOur party ordered and shared:\nTwo of their signature cocktails\nCheese and meat platter\nLamb bolognese\nNY strip\nHalibut on couscous and orzo\nWhite bean hummus\nTiramisu\nCarmel upside down cake\nTurkish coffee cheesecake\n\nWe were thoroughly pleased with all but one dish-and even that dish (cheesecake)  was fine. The dishes were not overly creative and clever, but they were all seasoned well,  made with high quality ingredients, and prepared with skill.  The food was delicious. The seafood was fresh and buttery while the steaks were tender and cooked perfectly. This was one of the two best NY strip steaks I\'ve had in this town. The bolognese was heavy and the truffle oil threatened to over power the flavor of the sauce, but the richness of the lamb and sauce made for a dish that most people at our table called the best of the night.\n\nThe service was considered, the food was delicious, and the decor / atmosphere was luxurious.  I will definitely return to Vintner Grill.', 'business_id': 'MXqmV0513hptrtjihDdf3Q', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2014-08-10', 'type': 'review'}

Overall, Vintner Grill has a sophisticated food menu, with great options for a traditional multi-course meal, or more of a sharing and sampling approach to dining if desired.  I particularly enjoyed the charcuterie and cheese course, with the variety of options in this area of the menu.  Also, the lamb Bolognese pasta course was excellent.\n\nFor a restaurant of this caliber, there were some service missteps, such as:\n*No bread course was offered to our table, even though it appeared to be standard service to all the tables around us.\n*Follow-up was inconsistent from the wait staff, including instances such as:  For long periods in the evening, the wait staff disappeared altogether and we had no service for our table.  We were offered follow-up service for crostini for our charcuterie and cheese course, which never came.  We had cocktails throughout the evening, but our water glasses were empty and not refilled for the duration of the evening.\n\nI like to enjoy dining at a restaurant like this at a comfortable pace, which we were able to do so at Vintner Grill.  There was no pressure to turn over the table, which I appreciated.  However, service for a fairly simple limited course meal ran about 3 hours, much of this attributed to the disappearance of the wait staff.\n\nAll in all, Vintner Grill holds promise if they can address some fundamental service issues.', 'business_id': 'MXqmV0513hptrtjihDdf3Q', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2014-11-24', 'type': 'review'}

It was terrible.  The first server we had forgot to send over the bread and never bothered to tell us the specials.  Then he spilled tobasco sauce all over my husband\'s leather jacket and sweater, and he just walked away, and when we called him back, he "poo-pooed" it, and said he will "dry " him up, brought two napkins and patted the jacket down and my husband\'s body down.  You could smell the tobasco sauce, and he just said that he got it all, but you could see it on the jacket, so I asked for a manager.  The manager came over, and admitted the server had an attitude, and gave me his card, and told me to get the jacket and sweater dry cleaned and to bring him the bill.  He also said he would take care of us, and provide us with another waiter.  Dinner went on.....came time for dessert, and I couldn\'t decide between two desserts, so the new server suggested the upside apple cake, but said it would take 8 mins, and we asked to have our coffee with the dessert.  After about 15 mins, the server came back with the coffee, and said the dessert chef got behind so it will take a minute more, but he decided to bring our coffee.  Now 15 mins later, so a total of 30 mins now, we have finished our coffee, and here comes the waiter with our apple dessert and the other dessert we asked about but did not order, he said the manager said to bring both.  We waited and finally asked for the check, and the waiter said the manager took off the appetizer (cheese plate, $15) and the cheesecake dessert, the alternate dessert that we did not order, but charged us for the dessert we ordered.  I then went to the manager, and he said that was not right, he told the waiter to take off the appetizer, and the dessert, and I told the manager, but I only ordered one dessert, it wasn\'t my idea to bring the cheesecake dessert also.  So they ran a credit on my husband\'s credit card for the first check with the dessert, and took off the dessert, and then ran it again.  First, of all how are you not charging me for a dessert I didn\'t order, and really for all that trouble, and spilling tobasco on my husband, that is the only compensation, $15 cheese platter, and a $8 dessert?

The manager took our jacket and offered to find a reputable leather dry cleaner to clean the jacket.  We did not hear anything back for more than 3 weeks, so my husband called, and was told by the same manager that he was going to call the dry cleaners that day after 2 pm to see if the jacket was ready, and he would call my husband back after that to come and pick it up.  Needless to say, we heard nothing, so my husband called late afternoon the next day, and the manager told him the jacket was there to pick up, but yet never called to let my husband know he had the jacket.  He told my husband he could come and get it that day or the next day which was Sunday after 4 pm.  I was very sick that day, so my husband went the next day after 4 pm and the manager was not there, but the jacket was not dry cleaned properly, and in fact was ruined by some sort of agent put on it to clean it, it hardened the the leather.  My husband refused to take it, and said he wanted to speak to the owner.  the owner never called so I went to see the manager, after I spoke to someone else who told me they would take care of me, if we gave the restaurant another chance, and that the manager was his boss, and he told him about this.  When I got to the restaurant the manager told me he had never heard anything from this other person, and when I confronted the person, he lied saying he never told me such a thing.  Needless to say, that the manager said he would speak to the owner and get back to me first thing the next morning, and they could possible go and buy another jacket, or give me the money to buy another one.  I did not hear back from the manager nor the owner, therefore I called late that evening, and was told the manager would call me back in 10 mins.  The manager called me back in approximately 2 hours, and said they could not do anything, they have already done all they are going to do, and I could either come and pick up the jacket or they can mail it to me.

It's always appreciated. \n\nLet's get to the food. I've tried nearly everything & I love it, especially my mans NY strip that comes with crispy potatoes (crispy perfection) and balsamic reduction drizzled over everything.

We tried  to get some assistance with the cheese and meat choices but the waiter seemed too busy to help (I had read that this was one of their specialties)  So my husband and I each settled on a salad that came with brie.  A bus boy came around with a platter of bread choices and a butter/olive oil combo for dipping/spreading.\nI ordered the Vegan Portobello mushroom with spaghetti squash and loved it!  My husband had a flatbread (pizza anywhere else) that he enjoyed.\nWe were too full for dessert.  \nOur waiter was nice but not very friendly when we first arrived.  He didn't help or make suggestions for the cheese and meat when we ordered our drinks but he seemed to be nicer as the dinner progressed so maybe he was just too busy when we first arrived.  So 4 star instead of 5.  When a diner is looking for guidance with the menu it is worth taking the extra few minutes to help them.  \n\nI would recommend this restaurant.", 'business_id': 'MXqmV0513hptrtjihDdf3Q', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2015-01-20', 'type': 'review'}

The streak has been broken and I finally ordered something! \nThe burrata insalata with wild rocket, meyer lemon-balsamic vinaigrette, dried chiles and grilled sourdough (tomato salad) was relatively tasty. The prosciutto layered under the salad was a treat, but I wasn't as blown away as I'd like to be for a $13 salad. \nThat being said, I will try other menu items in the near future. Entrees range from the mid 20's for pasta to 30's & 40's for grill items. \n\nComplaining about prices here is somewhat justified, as you can get comparable eats in other nearby upscalish Summerlin establishments for less. On the flipside, Vintner's ambiance is rather unparalleled, in my humble snobbish opinion! It's smoke-free, even at the bar, which has video poker at a portion of it. I'm forever loyal to smoke-free gaming! There is no player's club at this time, so I'm begging and hoping they will bring it back! Please and thank you. \n\nFurther, their cocktail program (is that a thing?) is impeccable. Here's a sample- \nThe boulevardier is their take on a Manhattan, and it's hands down worth the $11 price tag. The g & t is served with some fancy pantsy mini tonic bottle on the side, & juniper berries add visual interest to this $11 cocktail. \n\nVino lovers will also be impressed with the varied selection of wines, and the bartenders are a wealth of knowledge about the wine. They do have beer, I'm sure, but it seems a tad uncouth for this swanky place. Kidding, but I've yet to check out the beer list. All in good time! \n\nThe outdoor patio with firepit is an intimate area amid the adjacent office buildings. Before I forget, Vintner is hidden (on purpose, one would surmise) deep within an office park near Indigo Drive. There is a sign on Charleston, but no matter how many times I've been here, I almost always have a hard time getting here. Perhaps this adds to its intrigue??", 'business_id': 'MXqmV0513hptrtjihDdf3Q', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2015-02-03', 'type': 'review'}

The restaurant and the food is amazing and that"s why it hurts me to write a bad review. My boyfriend and I have went here on our first date two years ago, we loved it and the whole experience was amazing. My best friend got married here a year ago and the wedding was beautiful. Tonight we went back to celebrate two years together where it all began for us. It was the worse customer service we had every experience. Mind you we are both managers at hotels and we know what it is to give great customer service, My boyfriend made a reservation through open table and in the notes wrote it was our anniversary. Our server did NOT SMILE, DID NOT ASK HOW WE WERE and seemed annoyed he had to help us. We had to wait 15 minutes for water which they brought the lemon out before the water. We then had to wait another 15 minutes to order. It took another 10 minutes to receive our wine. The salads came out quick, the bread came out half way through our salads with out any plates for the bread. The entrees came out before the cleared the salad plates and I had to ask for a refill on water twice. The server did NOT once ask how our food was, if we needed anything with our meal. When we finished, I actually had to ask for a dessert menu. It took him 15 minutes to come back to see what we wanted for dessert, when I ordered dessert i ordered coffee and asked for the coffee before dessert so I can sip while I waited. They brought the dessert out first and the coffee halfway through our dessert. I thought with them knowing it was our anniversary we would get a "happy anniversary" or something written or even SAID to us, that did not happen. This server has ruined what we considered our restaurant. Were locals and we go to Vintner Grill a lot. We always recommend it as it was our restaurant. The food never disappoints and after tonight, they genuinely lost our business and the word of mouth we use to spread. It doesn\'t matter how great the food is but if the service is anything like it was tonight, why would we pay to go back.

We started off with wine and a cheeseboard. Both being pretty open to most foods, we just let the server pick the cheese and were happy with everything he brought. \n\nAs with what is their staple, while we waited for our appetizer another person came around and offered us a selection of breads from his tray. We took a few selections and enjoyed the accompanying honey and butter. I can say that my low carb lifestyle was killed this night but I wasn't upset. \n\nAfter we finished off the first bottle and were well into our second we decided that after all the cheese and bread we'd just share the salmon tandori entree. Once again we were quite pleased with the food and service. \n\nThis was definitely a great experience and I can't wait until I go back to try more of their selections. I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good meal, great service, and great atmosphere.", 'business_id': 'MXqmV0513hptrtjihDdf3Q', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2015-05-05', 'type': 'review'}

I have experienced rude and generally poor service from the wait staff here the past two times I've eaten here. The service at this place ruins the dining experience completely, thus the one star rating.\n\nBoth times I ate there with my girlfriend, who happens to be very attractive. (Forgive me for having good taste, not only when it comes to food). The first time we went, we sat down and waited about 10 minutes for a menu. Our supposed waiter was nowhere to be found by the hostess until we pointed him out to her- he was attending to a large party, taking his time, making jokes and completely ignoring us- he would periodically walk by our table, checking out my girlfriend and not saying anything. Just walking by silently staring. I noticed this at least 3 times- it was creepy and annoying.\n\nOur order was taken by a 'temp server' who promised the actual server would take over- he didn't. Our food was placed on the table by two different servers/bussers. Out 'server' came by at the last minute to 'check' on us, as if he had been waiting on us the entire time, but that was toward the end of the meal- evidently to ensure we tipped him well as we were almost finished dining. \n\nAt the time he stopped by my girlfriend, an avid instagrammer was taking a picture of her food. (I don't partake in such activities but who am I to judge?) He made some corny joke about her taking a picture of him and framing it on her wall to which I replied 'I think we're good'. The whole experience was very confusing, awkward, and unprofessional. \n\nWe decided to try this place out one more time yesterday, went in with an open mind, hoping for a better dining experience with a different waiter. Even though our waiter was different, the experience was even worse. I don't know if our waiter had something going on personally, or maybe we didn't 'fit in' because we were wearing casual clothing and were younger than everyone else in the place, (it was about 95  degrees on a Monday afternoon- no way I'm not wearing shorts) but he was very rude as he approached us, didn't smile once, and took our order as if he would've rather been anywhere in the world but in front of us doing what he is being paid to do- mumbling and generally half-assing his way through taking our order. \n\nWhen I asked if I could substitute brown rice instead of mac and cheese he snapped at me saying that 'we don't have brown rice', and didn't offer any suggestions, until I asked him to suggest what other alternatives they had.  I should also mention that both me and my girlfriend are very polite people and both greeted him nicely and were polite the entire time.\n\nOnly after I sternly told him that we were in a hurry and to put a rush on the order, did he start acting more polite. \n\nOnce again, great food, horrible service. But maybe you'll be fine if you're older and wearing a collared shirt.", 'business_id': 'MXqmV0513hptrtjihDdf3Q', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2015-06-16', 'type': 'review'}

We were not disappointed in Vintner Grill last night. The greeting from the hostess was warm and friendly and we were seated right away. The white modernistic decor was very soothing, the music was appropriate and at a comfortable volume, the Woody Allen movie scenes playing on the few televisions was fun, and our waitress (I\'m so sorry I\'ve forgotten her name. Young lady, slightly pregnant.) was very prompt, knowledgeable and courteous.\n\nWith over 400 wines on the list, we chose the Bouchard Pere & Fils "Beaune du Chateau" 1er Cru Burgundian Pinot Noir. Great choice to be able to pair with most menu items. Light notes of cherry and strawberry, light spice, medium body, light hints of oak. Very much a standard example of old world pinot noir. Tasty.\n\nA large selection of fun breads to choose from was presented by the very cordial bus staff and the butter presentation was really fun also.\n\nWe started with V.G.\'s version of Calamari. Fried lemon wheels and fried haricot vert accompanied the well cooked and seasoned delicacy. The sauce however, was the star of the show. Cilantro, salt, pepper, and a light curry was a welcome change from the standard marinara that usually accompanies this dish. Well done Chef.\n\nMy wife ordered the Salmon Tajine. The sauce was flavorful, and the vegetables were well done. The salmon seemed to lack the "sear" that we normally enjoy but overall a good dish. It was a little cumbersome to eat though.\n\nI ordered the braised lamb bolognese. Incredibly flavorful braised lamb over slightly over cooked pasta in a VERY rich bolognese.  The most fun part of the dish was the cold Mascarpone cheese topping the dish that was an incredibly exciting juxtaposition to the hot, thick bolognese. Again, well done Chef. I was halfway through the dish when I found myself overwhelmed by the richness. Very good, but quickly filling and rich.\n\nThe only reason that I can\'t give 5 stars on this visit is that our entrees arrived before our appetizer was cleared and there was no attempt to crumb the table. But I must reiterate that we had a wonderful time with our server and she was outgoing, hospitable, knowledgeable and helped us have a great time.

The green olive bread was my favorite of the two I did try.\n\nThe cheese selection is very impressive so we had to get a cheese board.

To start off, the restaurant is pretty empty during the day so it was quiet. \n\nThe bread came out on a platter and the waiter would put the bread that you choose on your plate. I don't know why but I feel like the bread sets your first impression of the food. The waiter that served our bread had a stone cold face. He looked like he did not want to be there. Our bread was cold and hard. Tears of disappointment...\nThe butter had crushed peppers and another with basil (I think) with oil.

It was very heavy. The ratio of lamb to pasta was unbalanced. There was twice the amount of lamb to pasta. I ended up putting some lemon juice and it was a lot better. \n\nThe crab ravioli was cooked very well, but the filling was nehhh.

The restaurant has a great atmosphere and we loved that it\'s tucked away in a hidden corner. Next time, we\'ll have to try the patio seating--which is beautiful! We started with the cheese and meat plate for an appetizer, and man did it deliver! The purple haze was my favorite, absolutely delicious. My boyfriend chose a flatbread for his entree, and I had the honey-mustard glazed half chicken with the "mac and cheese." His flatbread was bigger than expected and he said it was delicious. My favorite food on the planet is mac and cheese, and theirs was great, but the chicken blew the mac out of the water. It practically melted in my mouth. Beyond fantastic. We ordered a salad to share in between our appetizer and entree, but it somehow got forgotten in the shuffle. We weren\'t worried about it since what we ordered was more than enough. However, our server was so apologetic for mistake he threw in a tiramisu for us to take home with our leftovers to make up for it. My only complaint would be that its a long dining experience, so don\'t come here if you are tight on time.

Let me start by saying that I booked my reservation through Open Table like I normally do. We were celebrating a birthday and I put a note in the message box for Vintners to see so I wouldn't have to do it at the restaurant. I asked twice before we were seated to make sure they checked me in. \n\nWhen we were seated the waiter seemed nice enough. We placed our order which included a cheese plate, hummus and he calamari to start. Right away the waiter was trying to up sell us on every item. I felt like I was at a fast food restaurant. It was very strange. They have never done this here before. All apps were brought out at the same time. So much for enjoying the cheese plate with my nice bottle of Opus One. While we were eating the apps I asked the waiter to please check and make sure they had checked me in on my reservation. He assured me they had.\n\nWe then placed our order for dinner and the BF and I both ordered the bouillabaisse which has been amazing every time we have been here. Of course the waiter did his up sell and offered us a chance to add pasta to it. Sounded okay so we did it. When the bouillabaisse came out I could tell right away something was wrong. The scallops were raw, shrimp was raw and when I took a bite of a mussel it was cold and had the worst metal taste to it. That was it for me, I could not finish it. I could also not get that metal taste out of my mouth. The manager was at my table within seconds and asked me if everything was okay. I told him the problem and he took the dish away. The BF continued to pick at his. But eventually had to give up as his was raw too. Before we could tell the manager, the bus boy came by and took it away.\n\nThe waiter came by to let me know he had removed the entire dish from my bill. I would expect him to remove the entire dish since it was raw. He acted put out like he was dong me a favor. After he cleaned the table, I could tell that they did not see my note about the birthday so I asked for the check. They did not remove the BF's meal which I found to be rude. We paid the check and left. On my way out, I asked the hostess again if she had checked me in, she said yes. This really angered me, if they had checked me in, they would have noticed the birthday note.\n\nWhen I got home I received an email from Open Table that Vintners had cancelled my reservation. You have got to be kidding me!! What a joke. I called the manager and basically he said all he could do was apologize. Apology not excepted.\n\nWithin an hour of getting home we both became very sick with food poisoning. All night long we were very sick and still not feeling well tonight. Vintners should be ashamed of themselves! We will never be returning.
