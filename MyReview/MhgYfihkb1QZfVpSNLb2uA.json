On the drive home it was decided that tacos and guacamole from Chipotle could be a quick & easy dinner, but as we passed by the newly opened (1 month ago?) Grimaldi\'s in Boca Park, we made a last-minute decision to give their pizza a spin.\n\nWe order a small house salad ($5) and it is large enough to feed 3-4 people, so the two of us have plenty of green to eat. The house vinaigrette is not very vinegary, but the tomatoes and mushrooms are fresh and the whole green olives are good quality. We order a large, traditional Grimaldi\'s pizza with onions, garlic and jalape\xf1os ($15 + $2 per topping = $21). As we wait for our pizza, a quick survey of the pizzas on other customers\' tables make me a little nervous that the coal-brick-oven at Grimaldi\'s is over-baking their crust. Every pizza I see in the restaurant has dark-brown/black burnt crust edges. (Thinking that it will take a really resilient dough recipe to withstand that level of scorching, I will be very impressed if their crust is actually chewy/crispy!)\n\nOur pizza shows up. The cheese looks great - it has that stark white color of good Buffalo mozzarella. Bonus fresh basil in the middle of the pizza! No visible grease puddles on or under pizza! Overall the topping quantity isn\'t terribly generous, but compared to Settebello\'s \'authentic\' (i.e. totally skimpy) pizza topping distribution, I find no reason to complain. With the first bite of any thin crust pizza, I pray to the pizza gods that the crust will be perfectly 50% crispy and 50% chewy. Unfortunately, Grimaldi\'s crust is 80% crispy and 20% chewy, and by the time the pizza is half eaten (4 slices left) it stales and becomes 100% crispy, much like the crust texture of a Tombstone frozen pizza. How did this happen?!\n\nThe edge of the crust is unacceptably crunchy and flavorless (and burnt!) and the second half of the pizza left me wondering what went wrong with this pizza - how does a pizza crust take a total turn for the worse after only 10 minutes into a meal? We could have easily left 2 pieces for a togo box for next-day\'s lunch, but found ourselves in a better-eat-it-now-because-it-will-get-stale situation as the crust was already surprisingly stiff. I actually heard the crust *snap* all way down the middle when folding the last slice! \n\nMy favorite pizza experiences in North America have included a few special pies at Lou Malnati\'s (Chicago), Pizzeria Bianco (Phoenix), John\'s Pizzeria (NYC), Frank Pepe\'s (New Haven) and Pizzeria Rustica (Miami). In Vegas I have had good luck at Metro Pizza and at Rocco\'s NY Pizzeria, and the pear/gorgonzola/arugula/proscuitto pizza at the Sammy\'s location on Sahara is a consistently tasty choice. With respect to Grimaldi\'s, I could say "maybe we got a bad pie" but judging from the dozen other over-baked pizzas I saw on customers\' tables, I think a baking-time or yeast adjustment could really help - the flavor is all there - the crust just needs a little chewy tweaking! Service is friendly and very attentive. Apparently, the cheesecake at Grimaldi\'s is homemade and as good as NYC Stage Deli\'s...', 'business_id': 'MhgYfihkb1QZfVpSNLb2uA', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2010-04-04', 'type': 'review'}

One of the most lauded pizza joints in New York City, they appeared to have branched out - franchising 2 joints in Las Vegas\n\nSo, after much anticipation, my hubby and I bit the bullet and went for a piece of pie.\n\nMeh. Really. The pizza was not as flavourful as what we expected. We had the marinara (tinned, pureed tomatoes) sauce with sausage, basil and onions. The lack of spice of the sauce and the sausage was  a total downer. The small amount of basil they did put on the pizza did nothing to detract from the overall blandness of the poor pie. Which was rather sad because the crust is one of the best we\'ve tried.\n\nWe did go back to try Grimaldi\'s a second time - this time opting for a "white" sauce with meatball and onions. Still, the food was rather bland. Our server this time did bring us some dried oregano and garlic powder which we doused the poor slices with to give it some flavour.\n\nReally, for the food alone, it does probably deserve maybe a three star rating.

We also ordered 2 medium pizza, with each half having different combination of toppings for more variety.

This spot has failed numerous times over the past 5 years.....I hope these people make it.\n\nAnyway, I sat at the bar and ordered a Blue Moon.

If you do, you'll like the pizza at Grimaldi's.  Although I lack experience with true NY style pizza, I must say that if this represents a small percentage of it, I'm down for some NY love.  \n\nGrimaldi's is all about the oven, the crust, and the fresh ingredients.  When I saw the 3.5 star rating two weeks ago I realized that I had to eat the pizza to find out for myself.  Mind you, all of us have different tastes when it comes to pizza, each person wanting a certain stretch to the dough or sweetness to the sauce.  I personally love sweeter sauce, but at Grimaldi's it's more tangy.  I personally love shredded cheese but here it's sliced fresh mozzarella.  I needed to try something different, so I went for the personal with basil.\n\nIt took ten minutes to complete my pizza, not long at all.  When I received the box I sort of freaked out at the size.  I'm used to the pizza hut sizes, where personal means that small round personal pan pizza.  Their version of personal reminds me of a medium, or something very close to that.  The crust is super thin, slightly crispy especially on the edges, and the ingredients are layered nicely on top.  It was interesting to see the sauce exposed between the slices of cheese, and crispy basil on top.  I hopped into my car, turned on the a/c, and peeled a slice from the box.\n\nWow.  This pizza is yummy.  I'm not going to go so far as to say something fabulous, amazing, or even orgasmic, but I love this pizza.  At the point it's slightly soggy from the sauce, but still holds up while you eat it.  It's one of those pizzas I recommend folding the sides in a bit while holding it to eat it properly.  My husband hates crust and he ate the whole pizza--crust and all.  I love the tangy fresh tomato sauce, the mozzarella that stretches beautifully when bitten in to, and I go for basil in the oven rather than after because it gets sweeter and has that crispy texture to it.  Yum.\n\nAfter the first time there I went back two days later for the same order.  Then two days after that.  Oh and then three days from that day, and then four days ago and the day before yesterday.  Yeah.  I like it that much. I always order the same thing--personal with basil--because I don't want to ruin the flavors of the other ingredients and the crust.  I love the taste of the dough on this pizza--slightly sweet, almost a hint of sourdough-ness, and you can taste the char a bit.  \n\nRemember, we all have different tastes, and many aren't in to this type of pizza.  For me, it's the only pizza I'll eat till I find another great NY pizza joint in town.  The other downfall of this place are the prices.  Many wouldn't pay $9 for a personal size and then pay $2-$5 dollars per additional topping.  The small is $13, for example, so many get turned off by the price.  Still, it's a great pizza joint that I've yet to eat in at because I love the idea of getting a pizza in a box.  It's just this weird thing I have with pizza.\n\nYou should try Grimaldi's if you haven't yet.  It's not your typical pizza delivery crap, but something ten times better.  I like it, and I hope that your taste in pizza matches this place, too.", 'business_id': 'MhgYfihkb1QZfVpSNLb2uA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2010-07-03', 'type': 'review'}

I\'ve been a fan of their pizza ever since it was introduced to me at work when we were filming TV shows near the eastside location.  I had been meaning to come by and show my support for the "new" Grimaldi\'s by my house for awhile.\n\nWe dined on the patio, and it was perfect weather to do so.  Yes, it\'s that one week in Vegas between hot summers and cold winters.  The service left something to be desired, and I was bummed that there weren\'t any appetizers on the menu like garlic knots (I swear there used to be, no?) -- but those are my only real complaints.  The pizza was great, and the ingredients were fresh as always.\n\nI\'m sure there was a price for the pizza, but I got lucky in that I won some Internet contest and received a $100 Grimaldi\'s gift card in the mail a month or so ago, so the only money that left my pocket was for a tip.', 'business_id': 'MhgYfihkb1QZfVpSNLb2uA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2010-10-14', 'type': 'review'}

Maybe a slice from Metro Pizza, or a cheap $5.00 from Little Ceasars, but it's not often I go to a place wanting more than just your average slice. Grimaldi's Pizzeria is that place to get that more than average slice!\n\nWe decided to visit Grimaldi's after a brief business meeting that didn't run quite as brief as we had planned. We considered going to Monta (refer to my past review that great experience) but based on the size of the group we decided somewhere a little more open would be more suitable. A member of the group had mentioned that Grimaldi's was a great place for some pizza, and so we took a vote and Grimaldi's came out on top.\n\nOnce we arrived I was pleasantly surprised by the decor. This place really gave off a classy vibe while still being comfortable and fun. The chandeliers weren't diamond and gold, they were empty wine bottles, talk about inventive! There were older pictures framed on the wall that really made you feel like this place had something authentic going on, which I suppose it did. They only design flaw that came to mind for the group was that there was only one restroom for both genders. Not really too much of an issue when it's not that busy, but I'd imagine an unhappy line of people during the high business hours.\n\nNow whats the first thing you look at after you sit down in a restaurant? Many people might say the table, and in that case you're probably right. But one of the first things you take a good look at is the menu. The menu I had in my night was at first a little confusing. At Grimaldi's they don't have a list of pre-built pizza, every pizza is built to order. There were three types of base pizza. The traditional pizza, a white with garlic pizza, and the pesto. Following that was a list of toppings including items like fresh cut tomatoes, meatballs, and even anchovies. Knowing their menu can be a bit daunting, the waitress was very quick to inform everyone at the table of how the ordering process went. Not only was this very helpful, it was quite entertaining as well. The staff was excellent and very knowledgeable about their menu. The waitress also helped us decide on how we would split the check before we ordered, which is great because at most places we're left at the end with 5 people who need to pay on card and no pre-arranged plan what-so-ever.\n\nBeing new to the place our side of the table decided to try something we don't usually see on a menu. We opted for a Large (18 in.) white and garlic pizza with Meatballs, Italian sausage, sun dried tomatoes, and artichoke hearts. The wait for the food was a little long, but understandable considering the table had so far ordered 3 large completely custom pizzas. The pizza that arrived was amazing. The toppings tasted quite fresh and the flavor was fantastic. The crust was enjoyable and the cheese was stringy and delicious, just how I like it. The standard condiments were at the table, parmesan and the crushed red pepper, but they were also joined by a few others like garlic powder. Each pizza was cut into 8 pieces and since we had 6 people on our check we decided it was a good idea to order a second.\n\nThe second pizza we ordered was a large Pesto with grilled chicken, roasted sweet red peppers, and freshly sliced tomatoes. If you haven't eaten a pesto pizza before, maybe Grimaldi's should be where you are having dinner tonight, this pizza was amazing. It was full of flavor, the fresh pieces chicken complimented the flavorful pesto while the sweet red pepper really brought balance to the whole ensemble. The waitress had told us that people order combinations similar to this and we can see why, it did not disappoint in the least.\n\nGrimaldi's Pizzeria is a bit on the pricey side, the average large pizza you will build comes out to around $30.00 each, but when you break it down to each person it's not that bad. Grimaldi's over all was a great experience and definitely a good place to go if you're looking for more than the average slice of pizza and want to be daring with your choices.", 'business_id': 'MhgYfihkb1QZfVpSNLb2uA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2010-10-21', 'type': 'review'}

Having eaten at the Brooklyn location, I had huge expectations, but they fell short. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the pizza wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. It was just OK. The crust was thin and crispy, just how I like it, and my plate wasn't covered in orange grease when I was done., which is another positive. \n\nBut the pizza, which started out as great, became increasingly boring piece after piece. I don't know how this is possible, but both the sauce and the crust lost some, or rather most of their punch after it cooled down a bit. \n\nWe ordered a  1/2 carafe of their house red and it was lovely, and the service we experienced was exceptional. No complaints there. \n\nWhen shopping in Boca Park, it would be a great stop for lunch, and hubby and I agreed we'd return to Grimaldi's rather than go to our usual lunch spot, Cheesecake Factory, but we probably won't be planning any dinners here again. \n\nOh and the outside dining is fabulous!

I heard a manager talking, saying he was "giving this table of first-timers a comped order of canolis" \nWhen we were seated we went outside, and it was beautiful out so that was great. The hostess offered "iced tea, water, or maybe a Peroni" She didn\'t ask us if it was our first time, offer to describe the menu and their prices or try to upsell anything like an appetizer or garlic bread or salads. We decided to split a large and the ladies in the group were gonna split a small pizza, and the small is still plenty to share. The girls also decided to split a small caesar salad. We ordered and everything went normal. The pizza took a little longer than I anticipated being a very thin crust and the very beginning of lunch hour, but came out nicely proportioned with plenty of meatballs and onions on one, and plenty of ricotta cheese and pepperonis on the other. The pepperoni was nice and spicy, and the meatballs are full of flavor and nice and large too.\nWhen it came time to ask if everything was going well, clear the plates, get us our checks and get the hell out of there is where the service lacked. Our server disappeared for a good 10-12 minutes when we were done eating and it took a long time to get the check and clear the credit card back to us to sign.  One of the other things that bugs me about Grimaldis is that each topping is at least $2-4 and the personal cheese pizza starts at $10 and the large at $18. If you get a large with 2 toppings you\'re already looking at $24+ just for a pizza. Add two drinks and a salad and you\'re looking at $45 with a tip for a lunch.\n\nAlso, what kinda place doesn\'t serve ranch? We asked for a side of ranch to dip the crust in when the pizza came and she said they don\'t even serve it at this restaurant. With salad on the menu how do you not serve ranch? This is America right?

The only thing I really care is how it tastes. And, the pie that we had was mighty good.\n\nWe started with a mediocre  small Mediterranean salad ($7). It was large enough for three or four.\n\nThe pizza we tried was a small white with garlic ($16) with two toppings (pepperoni and mushrooms, $2 each). The crust was excellent, with a decent amount of it charred, as can be expected from a brick oven place. Even with all the cheese and pepperoni that was on the pizza, the bottom of the crust held up well and wasn\'t soggy, providing a crisp and crackling texture with every bite.\n\nThe small pizza is more like a medium and is large enough for two to share. Their "personal pizza" is what others would consider a small.\n\nThe most annoying thing about this place is that toppings are the same price no matter what size of pizza you get. Obviously, you\'re going to get more pepperoni, for example, if you get a large pizza. But, if you get a personal pizza you get less but have to pay the same price. These pies aren\'t cheap, so when you start adding toppings the price can get ridiculous.\n\nI\'m not sure I\'ll be back to this location, just because finding parking at Boca Park is always a hassle.

I told her to bring all the food out as soon as it's done and she said she understands because the kids will start to go crazy if sitting there for too long. We started off with a caprese salad but when it came out, the tomatoes were pinkish white, not red. When you're serving a salad with only 3 ingredients, every one of them needs to be perfect. The kids didn't want to eat his very adult salad so we asked for bread as well as a dish for the balsamic and olive oil. 15 minutes later, still no bread so we flag down the server and she finally brings it out to us. The dish never came. \n\n15 minutes later, our pizza comes out. We ordered a red pizza with spicy pepperoni and mushroom. The middle was wet, not crispy like the Grimaldis on Eastern. The cheese was chewy, so you had to just chew and eventually swallow it whole because it won't separate. My 4 year old who loves pizza said that it was terrible because the cheese keeps falling off of his floppy wet pizza. \n\nWhen we finished, we wanted to order the cookies and cream cheesecake but nobody looked at us for a very long time. After looking around, we realized that there was only one server, one manager, and three busboys for 15+ tables. It was ridiculous!! We sat there for so long that we decided not to get dessert and when we flagged somebody down, I just gave them my card without seeing the receipt because I didn't want to wait for them to pick up my card. When I got home and checked my bank account, I had two pending charges of the same amount from Grimaldis. \n\nIf we eat at Grimaldis again, we are making the drive to Henderson.

I'm gonna preface my review by saying this; Grimaldi's is... different. I don't mean it's a bad place; it's actually a really good pizzeria. It's just coal fire pizza. That's not something I'm particularly accustomed to. It is however not a bad approach. I'll always be a diehard brick oven proponent. To a pizza maker/connoisseur, it's more drastic than a Pepsi vs. Coke argument. It's more like Charcoal vs. Gas grills, American vs Foreign cars, Macs vs. PCs, or Revolvers vs. Semi-Auto pistols. It's just a fundamentally different approach. But I can actually appreciate it for what it is. \n\nThe decor is nice and classy for a pizzeria. Like a more upscale old school NY pizza joint. The quality of ingredients are high. I order different things now and then. I really like the meatball and ricotta toppings. Being coal oven pizza, you still get a pretty crispy pie. Sometimes, the crust is too crispy though, even for me. And since this is all the nature of the beast with coal ovens, the toppings aren't always piping hot. But it all has a really good flavor to it. And the service is outstanding. If you sit at the bar you might have Audrey serving you. She's a good friend, and she's pretty awesome. Tell her I sent you, if she's there when you go. The manager is pretty cool too! I would definitely recommend giving this place a try, if you have any interest in pizza whatsoever. If you are diehard like me, and from back east... you may be more critical. Just look at it as something a little different and appreciate it for what it is. You might actually love it. I've put it in my pizza rotation, and I think that says a lot.

Just park in the strip mall and head towards the fountain and you will find one of the greatest pizzerias in Summerlin (the other one is Rocco's by Costco).  I'm born & raised NY and my taste buds have been in training all my life, I know Great Pizza.\n\nThis thin crust is cracker crisp and will stay perfectly horizontal even without folding.  Here is what separates the Grimaldi style from others: \n1. They place fresh HANDMADE mozzarella slices (not shredded) on the crust FIRST\n2. Sauce is drizzled on top after the toppings (white pizza does not even have sauce)\n3. Oven temperature is HOTTER than hell which can soar up to 1200 degrees.  This coal oven brick pizza gives the crust that distinct charred flavor and crispiness.  Look under the crust and you will see the color that's different.  \n4. Pepperoni are little tiny salty slices which crisp up a bit.  SOOO GOOOD\n5. When you have been in the pizza business this long, you know that there are key factors that people connotate with excellent pizza: New York style, NY water, sauce, cheese, oven temperature, etc.  Grimaldi re-creates the NY style of water by re-creating the exact mineral content of Brooklyn water to make sure the dough is just like NY.\n\nThe coal brick oven is a goldmine and permit nightmare in NYC.  It wasn't possible to install a coal brick oven in Manhattan where Grimaldi originally wanted to open his pizzeria, so he opened up in Brooklyn (coal ovens had to be grandfathered in from the building).  Under the bridge on Old Fulton Street is famous, but now with the latest lease controversy, there is the new location around the corner from the original.  Back in 1904 Lombardi opened a brick oven pizza in SOHO and you can also wait in line to compare.

We have gone there several times since they opened and to say our experience has been a mixed bag is an understatement. Over time we have become dyed in the wool pizza snobs. We look for the best pizza where ever we travel and have learned a lot about what goes into a great pie. We especially like wood and coal fired oven pizzas so we knew Grimaldi's would be right up our alley.  I've had a few very good pies at Grimaldi's and I've had a couple of questionable experiences.\n\n  On our first couple of trips to Grimaldi's we ordered pepperoni pizza and wine. The pies were well made with a nice char on the crust as one would expect from a coal fired pizza. The service was quick and very friendly. We were definitely satisfied with our visits early on. On a subsequent visit things got a little funny. We hadn't tried a margherita style pizza at Grimaldi's so we decided that that would be the order of the day. Now mind you the Vegas location doesn't have margherita as choice on their menu, but it's a pretty simple traditional pie. It's just sauce, mozzarella and basil. Pretty straight forward, right? So I thought. Upon asking for a margherita pizza I was given an explanation about east coast margherita vs. west coast margherita and how each is made. His whole east coast/ west coast thing made me forget we were discussing pizza and had me believing the conversation had turned to hip-hop music. East coast/ west coast? Really??!! It was obvious that instead of telling me he didn't know what a margherita pizza our server wanted to b.s. me. At this point he suggested that we try both pies. Against my better judgment I went along with him. Needless to say, both pies were wrong. The most interesting of the two pies was the east coast pie which did have basil on it: about $40 worth! Since that experience I have made a trip to Brooklyn and went to the original Grimaldi's where they knew exactly what a Margherita pizza is. Must be some sort of disconnect between the mothership and franchises.\n\n  With all of that being said Grimaldi's does serve a good pie and is worth the trip. The serve is always good and the wine list has some nice choices as well. Just remember, if you want a margherita pizza write down the instructions on how it's made! East coast or west coast!!", 'business_id': 'MhgYfihkb1QZfVpSNLb2uA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2012-01-11', 'type': 'review'}

The Brooklyn location was pretty crowded.  We waited in line for a while to enjoy communal seating and grumpy Eastern European servers.  The pizza was good, but exhausting to get to.

Do some frickin research.  But if you like thin crust pizza, with high quality ingredients, this is the place for you.  \n\nI suggest asking for extra cheese.

Their small is like most mediums (16") and the large is, well, large!  They advertise coal brick oven pizza and that\'s exactly what you get: delicious, thin crust pizza with very fresh toppings.  There are a several pizzas (combinations of toppings) on the menu you can chose from, but you can also create your own from a reasonable list of toppings and sauce types.\n\nThe staff is fantastic every time I\'ve gone.  You\'re greeted warmly at the door, seated and quickly have the attention of one of the waitstaff.  I\'ve also ordered pizza to go and don\'t mind the wait while it cooks.  You\'re invited to sit at the bar, located close to the front of the restaurant, where the bartenders have also always been awesome.  There are TVs over the bar, and I\'ve always been offered a courtesy soft drink while I wait.  They bring the pizza to you, check to see that it\'s what you want, pay the bill and  you\'re on your way.\n\nMy only word of advise for those who take out:  because the pizza is thin crust, it cools very fast.  I only live a few miles from the restaurant but my pizzas usually need a little love in the oven by the time I get home.  That said, it\'s never hurt the flavor and I definitely wouldn\'t avoid Grimaldi\'s for take-out because of this.  Fantastic restaurant with fantastic food.

It is thin crusted with a portion that will fill you up, and your company will not be thinking badly of you for taking one slice too many.

It's conveniently located near my favorite coffee shop so why not I said?\n\nThe first thing you'll notice is how neat it looks inside. Wine bottle chandeliers, and various accouterments adorning the walls. They have a rather odd business model. The base pizza includes dough and sauce. Yes that's right...cheese is a topping. Rather silly way to justify charging more money to your customers. I would have preferred to pay the same amount with the cheese built into the base price of the pizza-- at least I wouldn't have felt my intelligence was being insulted. Although I suppose it's possible that there might be some lactose intolerant customers who take advantage of this opportunity not to have cheese on their pizza...\n\nAnyway you'll also find that the price starts to rack up rather quickly as you begin adding toppings to your creation, which you'll simply have to do at a place like this. We chose mushrooms, meatballs, and pepperoni. The quality of the ingredients is apparent. The meatballs were juicy and flavorful and definitely not frozen crap that came out of a factory. The tomatoes of the sauce are allegedly organic and I did find the sauce to be full flavored. The mushrooms are also a tasty, chewy delight. The cheese takes some getting used to. Ricotta as a pizza cheese is definitely an unusual choice but I did enjoy the meal over all. The lack of grease is a plus. I also really liked the way you can watch them put it all together. The pepperoni had a kick to it and seemed to be something you might find at a nice Italian deli rather than a Pizza hut.\n\nThe originality of this place, combined with the quality of ingredients, will certainly merit a return from me, but it falls short of a five star experience.", 'business_id': 'MhgYfihkb1QZfVpSNLb2uA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2013-02-10', 'type': 'review'}

We usually order one to eat there and one to take home, because it's just as good, if not better leftover the next day! \nThe outside patio seating is great for the kids and so is the pizza dough that they bring out for them to play with. \nWe have done many family birthdays here with quite a few people, and every time, even though they don't always have a lot of floor space for all of the people that we bring in, they are always accommodating. (The Eastern and Serene location has a separate room for larger parties, which is easier. ) \n\nDespite another review below,  your pizza does include cheese in the base price. They only charge for cheese if you are ordering extra cheese. Also, ricotta cheese is not the standard cheese that your pizza comes with, that is an extra topping that you can order. They use fresh mozzarella on their pizzas. So I think it's kind of funny that this reviewer felt their intelligence was being insulted about having to pay for cheese, when in fact they had it all wrong to begin with!", 'business_id': 'MhgYfihkb1QZfVpSNLb2uA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2013-05-22', 'type': 'review'}

The O.G. Grimaldi's Pizzeria is located in NYC, and is legendary in those parts as being one of the best places to get a slice.  In fact, the one time I was in NYC and had plans to eat there, the line was out the door.  Needless to say we missed the boat on that one.  \n\nBut luckily, even though it's not location #1 there's a Grimaldi's here in good old Las Vegas.  NY pizza?  Made in coal burning brick oven?  There's nothing like it.  Definitely a step above your chains like the Hut, Dom's, or Papa's.\n\nNo offense against Chicago, but I love a slice of NY pie.  No deep dish here at Grimaldi's, just yummy thin crust!  Crisp, a nice burnt edge, clean and tasty.  I could eat an entire pie by myself if given the opportunity.\n\nGrimaldi's has a great menu, somewhat typical of what you would find in a pizza joint.  But simplified.  No chicken fingers or intricate pasta dishes here.  Just pizza, calzones, and salads on the main menu.  And I like it!  Simple is good, as long as you do it right.\n\nThe wifey and I shared a date night out and had a great meal.  We started with the Grimaldi's House salad - romaine lettuce, red onion, cherry tomatoes, roasted red peppers, mushrooms, green olives, and mixed with the house vinaigrette.  Good starter - fresh, light, and flavorful with a good kick from the vinaigrette.  \n\nFor our pizza, we went for a large Grimaldi's seasonal special - The Buffalo Chicken.  It was a pie topped with grilled chicken breast, Buffalo sauce, mozzarella cheese, and bleu chesse crumbles.  Cooked till the crust and top was a golden bubby brown this pizza was pretty scrumptious.  Cheesy and melty, with a spicy punch, and a healthy crunch.  Not bad for a non-traditional pizza.  Next time though I think I might stick with something more Italian, maybe a straight up cheese, or a Margheria with cheese, fresh tomato, and basil.  \n\nPizzas range from $12 - $16 for an entire pie, with toppings coming in at an additional cost each.  Specialty pies will cost in the $20 - $22 range since they come with a range of toppings included.  Calzones come in around the $10 - $18 range depending on what size you get.  Salads are a good deal coming in small or large sizes at prices from $9 - $11.  You can get away with a decent meal for around $40 after tax and tip.  OK for a date night.\n\nGrimaldi's even does pizzas to go, and they come in a fancy box!  So in case you don't want to stay, feel free to call in an order, pick up, and go.  Pizza Pizza!

I know that\'s a dangerous statement to make for a chain restaurant, but I don\'t care! My order is typically a large white pizza with garlic (already comes with pizza), pepperoni, mushrooms and sausage. Then we get oregano, garlic powder, and Parmesan cheese on the side... and then a side of Caesar salad dressing - great for crust dipping, but I end up throwing some on my pizza as well. I\'ll go back and forth between the Caprese and the Caesar salad, but I think the Caprese has really good mozzarella and the tomatoes they use are really hearty. I started to get embarrassed here when the hostess kept on remembering us and always said "welcome back", but it\'s really more of a nod to their great customer service here. As of late, we\'ve just been heading straight to the bar to be served by Erin, who is one of the friendliest and thoughtful servers/bartenders you can ask for.

We always end up bringing 4-6 slices home with us, but they are great for leftovers the next day.

Am I the only one? Didn\'t think so. \n\nStopped by this Grimaldi\'s right around lunch time after my friends and I had tuckered ourselves out shopping for Christmas goodies around Boca Park. We were very hungry with visions of pizzas dancing in our heads as wen entered the rustic-looking establishment. It is not huge, nor is it small. The wooden tables and wooden decor all around make a nice, cozy feeling. I caught a glimpse of the lighting above, which are wine bottle hung from the ceiling - loved it!\n\nAs for the menu, it\'s straight up simple here so don\'t come looking for anything other than pizza, salad, or a calzone. There were no appetizers on the menu, to which I was slightly disappointed. This may be different at dinner, but I can\'t be sure.\n\nEverything here is pretty much build your own pizza, which I think is pretty cool. We started with the white garlic pizza (large), added grilled chicken, fresh Roma tomatoes, fresh basil, and for a nice spicy kick - jalapenos. Often times I think fresh tomatoes on pizzas make them soggy and gross, but luckily this one did not.\n\nThe pizza came out relatively fast; it is a nice, crispy, thin pizza, with a bubbly, brown, crunchy crust. I am not a pizza-connoisseur so I am not sure what "style" this may be, but I enjoyed it. I think we got just the right amount of toppings, anymore and the poor pizza would not have withheld them.\n\nMy suggestions: come if you want PIZZA, straight up, nothing else. Build your own and experiment with toppings. BUT - do not go crazy, I\'d say, 3 *maybe* 4 toppings at the most and make sure you\'re putting stuff on there that makes sense.\n\nOverall I was pleased, between the three of us we got an amazing pizza, plenty of toppings, and splitting the bill we each owed UNDER $10. Yes. That\'s a damn good deal. Of course, remember, there were three of us splitting a large, so prices may vary! I will definitely come back here to try some more styles and toppings.', 'business_id': 'MhgYfihkb1QZfVpSNLb2uA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2013-12-22', 'type': 'review'}

I went to the one inside the Fashion Show Mall on the Las Vegas Strip.  When I walked in the greeter asked if I wanted to sit at the bar and I said I preferred a table.  He walked me over to the table and seemed to care less.  \n\nThe sever came to my table and gave me the most basic service, making my experience average at best.  I ordered the Spinach salad with bacon, gorgonzola cheese, red onion, tomatoes with a balsamic vinaigrette.  The salad had good flavor, especially the dressing.  The bacon was kinda tough, as though it was prepared the day before sitting in the fridge.  The cheese wasn\'t the highest of quality as it didn\'t have that pungent smell/taste you usually get from gorgonzola cheese.  For $8 it was priced accordingly, if not a dollar too high.\n\nThe pizza came out and it was pretty tasty.  They didn\'t have any ranch, which was a bummer.  I ordered pepperoni, sausage and jalape\xf1os.  A basic pizza no toppings 12" was $9 and to add three toppings was $6.  I find this to be a little on the pricey side.  I have been to places like Pieology in Southern California (Irvine Spectrum) where you can get a personal thin crust pizza with UNLIMITED toppings for $7-$8.  $15 for a personal pizza just seems a little outrageous.  The flavors were good, but nothing that knocked my socks off.  With a salad, soda and pizza my bill came out to $28.  For that price I will probably not be back anytime soon, but if one of my friends wants to go there I will split a personal pizza, larger salad and pay half the price.\n\nSince the service was basic and the prices were a little on the high side, I have to give this place 3 stars.

Get to that later.  In the end, Grimaldi\'s is a legit pizzeria that does everything right.  Great atmosphere for a pizza joint, great service all-around (although it can sometimes be a bit slow), and the best made pizza I\'ve yet found.  \n\nSo let me explain the "best made" part a bit.  I can\'t quite say Grimaldi\'s pizzas are the best TASTING pizza I\'ve had, although it is among them.  By "best made", I am talking about the parts that made the whole.\n\n- Fresh toppings, including things like real basil leaves, real chopped garlic, etc.\n- Sauce that\'s not too much, not too little\n- (Outstanding #1) Real, white, sliced (not cut into little pieces) mozzarella cheese that eliminates much of the grease that you find at the typical NY pizza place (even in NYC)\n- (Outstanding #2) Perfectly made crust that is slightly crispy outside, perfectly chewy without being overly firm inside, and not too bready\n\nFrom ingredients and execution standpoint this really is a 5-star pizza.  The sum of all it\'s parts, however, may fall a bit shy of that since I can\'t bring myself to truly give it a full 5-star taste.  No matter, it\'s still close to it.  Plus, their Caprese salad is the bomb!  Fresh tomatoes and thick mozzarella chunks, bedded by giant, whole leaves of basil.  Nyam, nyam, nyam!  Where do they get those giant basil leaves??  And then top it all off with a glass of Peroni.\n\nIn my 4 visits to Grimaldi\'s I\'ve never been disappointed.  The only thing left to try is their calzone which, by the taste of their pizza crust, should be outstanding.\n\nTable-for-1 Factor:  I typically see most pizza joints as ideal solo dining spots.  Grimaldi\'s may not exactly fit that bill, but they do have bar area where you can sit and nosh on your own.  I don\'t see why not.', 'business_id': 'MhgYfihkb1QZfVpSNLb2uA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2015-04-13', 'type': 'review'}

Grimaldi's is my favorite pizza in Las Vegas!\n\nI've lived here for nearly five years, and I've tried all of what are purportedly the best pizza joints in town. I realize that pizza is a very personal taste, but for mine - it's Grimaldi's. I've never had a bad pizza there. \n\nI tend to change up what  pizza I order. Recently, I had their special white pizza. I don't remember the exact name of it, though I do recall that it had arugula and prosciutto. OMG - it was DELICIOUS. I think any pizza you order at Grimaldi's would be wonderful, but this is my favorite so far.\n\nIf you like Caesar salad, theirs is way above the normal pizza restaurant quality. The small size is more than enough for two!\n\nService has always been good, the wine list is decent for a pizza place, and the food has never missed. If you haven't tried Grimaldi's, do yourself a favor and check them out. I don't think you'll regret it!!

It was not my choice to go to Grimaldi's because after going to their Fashion Show location, I found their pizza to not be memorable. I never went back until this day when my coworkers wanted to go. I feel the same way, the pizza is ok and I have had better in Vegas. \n\nThe pizza is good. It is not bad, but not great. For a chain, I think the taste is just okay but better than Domino's, Pizza Hut, etc. The waitress forget my iced tea I ordered then charged me for it. When I brought it to her attention she said she would take it off the receipt, but no apology for forgetting. \n\nWhat I don't like is their prices and their add toppings per topping and pay per topping. I got a personal white pizza (enough for 1 meal if you are really hungry or 2 meals if you are not that hungry). It has 6 small/medium sized slices. The base price is $10 for a personal sized white pizza. Add artichoke hearts $4, add mushrooms $2, add spinach $2, add mushrooms $2. My pizza is now $20 for a personal size pizza! Hmm did my pizza have truffles on it for that price? I did not even get my sun dried tomatoes or extra garlic because it would cost more $$! I think this is a rip off. You are better off getting large pizzas and splitting them if your party can agree to the pizza type. They really should come up with some pizzas that have the toppings already on there. If you think you are being customized by allowing toppings to be placed on for additional charges, it does not work when it becomes highly overpriced. Well this is a big company and I highly doubt they will ever change their method of pricing per topping, so in that case I highly doubt I would be back (not by my choice). \n\nWe did get a free cheesecake for teacher appreciation week and I got strawberry. I was not impressed with the consistency of the cheesecake, it was soft (way too soft and yes there is such a thing). I like a firmer more dense cheesecake personally. The strawberries were kind of odd baked into the cheesecake, so they got weird mushy. \n\nI spent $32 for my personal size pizza, half a small salad I shared, water, and tip and tax. That seems like a lot for what I got.", 'business_id': 'MhgYfihkb1QZfVpSNLb2uA', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2015-05-26', 'type': 'review'}

We were greeted by Elliot when we walked in and asked us if we prefer the booth or high stool chairs. Booth pleeease! And I'm glad we did. I never knew how nice it is in the back of the restaurant. I always came in for dinner and sat in the front area or patio seating. Summer time is great with those booths in the back. Melissa introduced herself and asked if we would like to order any drinks. For two of us, she recommended the large Pellegrino, which was way too much for us. At the end of our meal, I burped and it stung my nose so bad, I had a tear fall down my cheek. Order the small bottle instead. Your nose will thank me later! \n\nWe ordered a small Grimaldi's House Salad, which looked more like a large portion! It felt like I drank a tall glass of fresh kool-aid. So refreshing! We ordered their large pizza with green peppers, artichoke hearts, and Italian sausage. My mom creation.. don't ask. Elliot came by with our pizza and asked us.. who would like the first slice. Then asked if we would like any Oregano, Parmesan Cheese, Garlic Powder, or Chili Peppers. We added all those to our slice of pizza and the first bite had so much flavor. I did notice that once the piping hot pizza cooled off.. the pizza, itself became stale. The chewy crust was hard as old french bread. Eat it while it's hot and you're good. Once it cools off, good luck! \n\nNow to the dessert. I love their Tiramisu here. I absolutely have to order this every time I dine here. It's made in-house and so is their Cheesecake. The mascarpone custard is creamy, light, and soft. The coffee and rum were so balanced that nothing overpowered one another. If you're in the mood for sweets, this is definitely a place for great Tiramisu!!! \n\nAt the end, Melissa, Elliott, and even the happy go manager lady thanked us for dining here and wished us to have a great day.

Quite simply,  if you can\'t handle half and half on one without it being a sloppy mess then don\'t offer that option.  The indifferent attitude of the pizza server added to the annoyance.

When we arrive they told us they had to shut off the ovens at 4 and our pizza would be done until 4:45pm..which is fine.. Then they said we would be kicked out at 5pm for another reservation. So we only had 15minutes to eat. Great costumer service.. Said no one ever.', 'business_id': 'MhgYfihkb1QZfVpSNLb2uA', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2015-11-27', 'type': 'review'}

It's almost not there! I prefer a more substantial crust. Doesn't have to be pan pizza, just something to hold the toppings without becoming a soggy, wet piece of paper like substance. Sorry Grimaldi's. My friends, all from the East and all Italian, love it.", 'business_id': 'MhgYfihkb1QZfVpSNLb2uA', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2015-12-05', 'type': 'review'}

Being from the Midwest I feel like pizza just tastes different out here, but this place is one of the fine gems I've learned to love. The best part is how many combinations you can chose to go with. You never have to have the same pizza twice.\n\nMy boyfriend and I came here recently got a small which was plenty enough to share. We started with the caprese for an appetizer which was so so but for the pizza we went with meatballs, artichoke, mushrooms, basil, garlic and sundries tomatoes. Ah-mazing! The best part is the crust being crispy throughout the whole pizza. I cannot stand soggy pizza so it's definitely a plus for me. \n\nIf you're looking for good, quality pizza look no further!", 'business_id': 'MhgYfihkb1QZfVpSNLb2uA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2015-12-07', 'type': 'review'}

I was pleasantly surprised on how good it was. I have been trying all these other pizza places in town which are top rated and I found a few but my food here was fantastic. I had a Greek salad which was a good portion and a jalapeno and mushroom pizza. Crust was perfect.
