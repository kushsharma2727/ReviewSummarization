I love seeing restaurants crop up in that part of town that aren't just catering to the bar scene and making the food an afterthought. My girlfriend and I made reservations for Friday night expecting Bernie Kantak's new restaurant to be packed. Much to our surprise when we arrived, the place was pretty dead with tons of open tables. We purposely arrived early to enjoy a cocktail at the bar and even though we could have been seated right away, we pressed forward with our original plan.\n\nAt the bar, I ordered my usual cocktail while the GF ordered a sangria off their cocktail menu. We also ordered an order of the bacon fat heirloom popcorn from the bar snacks menu. My cocktail was perfectly made and my GF loved the sangria. The popcorn took forever to come out, but when it was delivered they also brought out an order of the calamari compliments of the chef. The popcorn was a little bit burned and we both thought it could have used some salt, which was surprising since we thought the bacon fat would have provided that flavor. The calamari was perfectly cooked and not greasy in the least. I enjoyed the pickled fennel on the side, but my GF isn't a fan of fennel, so she didn't try it.\n\nAfter we finished our cocktails at the bar, we moved to a table for the main event. In an unusual move for us, we skipped wine and stuck with beer and cocktails, but I did eye some good finds on the concise wine list. For our appetizer, we ordered the sausage of the day, which was a beef based sausage with a cabbage casing. It was very unique and we both really enjoyed it. For our main courses, the GF ordered the AZ B.L.T. and ordered the Pork Tender Loin. The B.L.T. had tons of perfectly crispy bacon on it, but we both agreed that it was really good , but not great overall. The Pork Tender Loin, on the other hand, was excellent in my opinion. I loved the figs and the sweet potato-chevre strudel. Of course, you could put chevre on anything and I would like it.\n\nWhen it was time for dessert, we knew that we had to try some of Tracy Dempsey's latest creations. We normally split dessert, but decided to each get our own. The GF got the cookies and milk and I had the chocolate toffee bread pudding. The cookies are delivered in a bag that you can take home, which is great because you probably won't down the generous serving of cookies in one setting  unless you're sharing. My GF was quite happy to take home a little bag of cookies to enjoy later. My bread pudding was awesome and I wish I could have purchased a gallon of the Maker's Mark ice cream to take home with me. I'll definitely be craving this dessert in the future.\n\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant is a little austere, even for my taste. It just seems like they could a little bit to make it a little bit more warm and inviting. Service, while extremely friendly, was a little bit uneven throughout the night starting with the snacks at the bar taking a long time and continuing with confusion over what tables plates should be delivered to. Keep in mind the restaurant has been open for only a week, so these are things that can be worked out.\n\nWe were really surprised to see the restaurant so empty on a Friday night, so I hope more people give it a try. Citizen is a really good neighborhood restaurant that has the potential to be great. We look forward to trying it again to see how it improves and evolves. I'm really hoping it's a successful staple in Old Town for years to come.", 'business_id': 'MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2011-01-29', 'type': 'review'}

We had the mac and cheese and the "other" chopped salad.  (Not the famous one.)  I had a pisco sour (good) and a gin cocktail off their menu (I wasn\'t crazy about it.)  BF had Stellas.  We wanted to sit on the patio, which was a bit sterile.  Just a little color please.  The bartender who waited on us was friendly, knowledgeable, kind, and great.  Host was great too!  The salad and mac and cheese we ate were very tasty.  If you are looking for a value, go to Bungalow or somewhere else, because, as my BF says "Happy Hour is supposed to be less that $40 :)"  Citizen wasn\'t, but we decided it woudl be a better dinner place.   I prevailed and...     \n\nWe bought a $100 gift certificate, which came with a complimentary $25 certificate.  We went back for dinner the next week with my sister and her husband who were visiting from Washington.  It was exceptionally quiet on a Friday night, which might have contributed to the restaurant feeling a bit sterile.  We all agreed the space needed some more division as it felt a bit "cafeteria."  Maybe skip the white tablecloths.  (We were just brainstorming  They don\'t seem very "gastro pub".)  The menu was very interesting and although, our server was not as exceptional as the bartender we had the first time, she was very nice.\n\nWe had the popcorn and original chopped salad to start.  The popcorn was greasier than I thought and not as flavorful.  I still liked it and enjoyed more than enough of it.  More bacon pieces, less bacon grease please.  The salad was FABULOUS!  Now I know why it is famous.  I would come back for this salad any day.  Great presentation.  Great taste.\n\nFor entr\xe9es we had the pork, grilled cheese, ribs, and pastrami.  The pork had excellent accompaniments and was cooked almost perfectly.  Love the figs!  The ribs were rated a 9.5.  Delic!  The grilled cheese was said to be on a brioche and was served on white bread and was somewhat underwhelming.   The pastrami was a starter portion  (which was fine) and was NOT a good cut of meat.  Because it was a small portion of meat, it was apparent, 1/2 of the portion of pastrami was pure fat.  Yucky.  The spaetzle was okay.  The brussell sprout kraut was okay.  (This was my dish if you can\'t tell :).  Underwhelming.\n\nI had the Manhattan which was excellent and the champagne cocktail which was quite tasty.  Sister is prego and had water and tea.  Brother had vodka and the rocks and BF had beer.\n\nDesert was a bread pudding to share which was tasty, but not quite as interesting as the menu would lead you to believe.  Cappuccino was EXCELLENT!\n\nWe like this place.  I want it to succeed.  I don\'t know if they need to throw some rugs on the floor, to put a room divider next to a table or what, but they need to make it feel like a gastropub if that is what they want it to be.  Right now it feels like they are lost somewhere between fine dining and I\'m not sure.\n\nFocus on the menu.  And the good servers.  Add some more decor.  And the quality.  And we will be back.  Good.  Almost great.', 'business_id': 'MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2011-01-29', 'type': 'review'}

I see that guy damn near everywhere I go, so it must mean Up Agency is handling PR for this place. This has nothing to do with the review.\n\nCitizen is a really cozy, warm, and inviting space, and is exactly the opposite of every other bar in old town. It is grown up, sophisticated, and has a huge emphasis on quality and interesting food. If you're looking for a greasy burger and fries to go with a Coors Light, you've stepped into the wrong place, compadre. If you'd rather go with a bottle of Dogfish Head's Midas Touch to accompany your Original Chop Salad, then Citizen will please your palate much more. A word on the Original Chop Salad, it's the Stetson Chop that you're all accustomed to from Cowboy Ciao. Bernie Kantak, the owner of Citizen created that salad whilst working at Cowboy Ciao, and it's his to take where he wants. Easily the most famous dish in town, in my opinion. \n\nIn my observation, Citizen is a douchebag free environment, a sanctuary for those who have become jaded from the usual Old Town bar scene. This would be a great place to have a drink after a night of dining at Marcellino or FnB, not a place to go before you head to Axis Radius or Myst. The white table cloths, dimly lit and somewhat romantic environs, and overal sexiness make this a great spot for a first or second date, or a perfect place to go before heading to the art walk or an event at the Center for Performing Arts.\n\nA couple of small knocks on a place though; they don't have a great selection of draft beers, in fact , I was rather disappointed to see they had Guiness, Bud Light, a couple of Four Peaks, and Pilsner Urquell on draft. They have some really interesting and high quality beers in bottles, but unfortunately the girl behind the bar wasn't terribly experienced with beer and couldn't tell us much about one or two that I was unfamilar with. I consider this a very minor inconvienence and perhaps if business picks up and enough people request it, they will add some good beers to the tap, otherwise, I'd rather drink a bottle of beer at home than in a bar.\n\nAll in all, this is a solid contender and I hope it does well. The Old Town scene seems pretty dead to me lately, as on a Tuesday this is one of three places I went where my group was literally the only ones in the house. I'm quite sure the weekend business is better, but you can't survive if you're operating in the red 2-3 nights a week. Here's to hoping Ty Largo does his job and gets the good word out there about Citizen Public House. He owes it to the public to let them experience it.", 'business_id': 'MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2011-02-02', 'type': 'review'}

We arrived to enter a cozy atmosphere full of energy from the group of guests enjoying their meals. The setting here is simple but simple does the trick because the food and drinks are excellent. \n\nWe started with cocktails and an appetizer. I was told the coconut drink (I'm blanking on the name) was like a vacation in your mouth and considering that I've got the tropical itch, I opted for that immediately. They warned me it was a stiff drunk, but I had no idea how stiff they really meant! Let me just put it this way, if you are looking for a cocktail that will do the drink for the entire meal, this is your drink. I didn't need another after just this one! \n\nMoving on to the food now! We started with a bar snack appetizer of Kilt Lifter fondue with sausage, pears and bread. It was a perfect snack to get our appetites moving and munch on the food while we waited for out entrees. The pears and fondue were an interesting combination but it grows on you after awhile. Apparently, I was feeling cheesy that night because for my entree, I went for the Grilled Halloumi Cheese which is on Serbian lepijna bread, with chickpea puree, pickles, Campari tomato, tender greens, tahini. I liked to think of it as a grown up's grilled cheese. Although it didn't have any meat in it, the sandwich was hearty and satisfying enough that it didn't need any. I had a taste of the Smart Chicken and that was excellent as well! \n\nTo end the good citizen meal, we had to try a Tracy Dempsey desert because how could you pass up one of these delicacies! We were told that the Chocolate Toffee Bread Pudding is a must for chocolate lovers. They weren't kidding! The dessert was delicious and just the right amount of sweet to end the meal. \n\nI like Citizen Public House because it isn't pretentious and while it's in the heart of Old Town, it doesn't have the Old Town scene vibe.

This place is beyond great; from atmosphere and service, to drinks and food.\n\n I have been meaning to write about Citizen\'s for a month now. I find that it\'s a breath of fresh air in a field of farts. Old Town had become so....well, old and it leaves a lot to be desired in the way of "classy joints". This is a perfect marriage of class and fun; I\'d say laid back elegance, if you will.\n\nThe interior decor is such a drastic difference from the old Club "Next". It\'s sleek, modern yet comfortable, great bar space and patio and even rooms for private parties. I love the fresh flowers and candles. \n\nI went with a girlfriend of mine and we sat at the bar. We started off with two specialty cocktails. I don\'t recall the names but one had cucumber and the other had freshly brewed tea in it. They were complex, fresh and most importantly, STRONG. Richie the bar manager took great care of us. He created their drink menu which is accessible but exotic. He is super knowledgeable and friendly. 2 things you need in a bartender. He\'s easy on the eyes too, so that helps.\n\nFor dinner, we shared the pork belly pastrami appetizer, chopped salad and scallops entree. Everything from start to finish was fantastic-you could taste and see Chef Bernie\'s influence in every dish. Complex flavors yet still had a comfort food feel, which I loved. At the end of the meal, Chef Bernie came out and talked to us. We saw him talking to every table and spending some time with all the guests which is pretty impressive, considering we went within the first two weeks they opened. He is a goddamn genius. Also, easy on the eyes...\n\nAt the end of the meal, I went to the bathroom and may have had too much to drink because I dropped my phone in the toilet. Richie offered me his extra cell phone for a few days until I got a new one. Now THAT\'S service! \n\nThis place is awesome and you can\'t help but love and support two of the coolest dudes doing some innovative things with food and booze.

As we were seated, we had this nagging feeling that we\'d look at a menu that was $25 a plate or more. Thankfully, most of the menu was very reasonable, especially considering the quality of the food, which I\'ll get into later.\n\nThe service was downright flawless. I wish I remembered the name of my waitress, because she was probably the most attentive waitress I\'ve had in years. The atmosphere is classy, very white and black. However, the indie rock playing on the restaurant speakers reassured me that this was a place that was also comfortable with being casual as well, a juxtaposition that I am sure only exists in the state of Arizona.\n\nNow, to the food. I wasn\'t in an appetizer mood, so I went right in with the Wagyu Burger. I am not kidding when I say THIS WAS THE BEST BURGER I HAVE EVER HAD THE PLEASURE OF CONSUMING! I ordered it medium well, as is typical with me and burgers, but with the quality of the meat they used, I should have gone with medium at least in retrospect. Everything in the burger, the bun, the veggies, the cheese, the homemade mayo they had on the side, was flawless. The arugula fries on the side were some of the best fries I\'ve ever had as well, and went amazingly well with their homemade ketchup.\n\nThe cocktails were expensive and didn\'t contain anything that particularly stood out at me, but I\'m sure they\'re great if you like what\'s in them. I paired my burger with a Duvel, which is great because I can rarely find that beer anywhere and it went perfectly.\n\nFor dessert, I had the Cookies and Milk since I was feeling pretty full from the burger but still wanted a nice way to cap my evening. What I got was a bag of five of the best cookies I have ever tasted. They came in exotic flavors such as "spicy chocolate fudge" and "apple bacon brittle oatmeal" so if you want to take your sweet tooth on an adventure, I highly recommend it.\n\nThis is quite a place if you\'re looking for a classy joint to enjoy a few drinks and great food, especially kind of late or on a date. One of the best places in the area, IMO.', 'business_id': 'MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2011-03-03', 'type': 'review'}

I've twice now toured the private upstairs space, and look forward to finding a fitting occasion to fill it with close friends. \n\nI've had fantastic service upon each of my visits - twice sitting at the bar, once at a Yelp event, and finally for a normal dinner, and feel completely confident in suggesting CPH to the most demanding diner. \n\nI'll update or edit this review to talk more about the food once I've had the short ribs and the lamb burger. The entrees I've tried thus far (the salmon and the chicken) didn't quite plumb the depths of my soul, and while the appetizers I sampled on other occasions were excellent, I don't remember any of them well enough to cover them in any detail. Hey, it was a busy month! I will say that the salads I've tasted are all amazing and that the bread pudding dessert was an absolute revelation right up there with the one delivered to John on the Isle of Patmos.\n\nI've saved what I feel to be the best feature of CPH for last: the drinks. I could attempt to describe the feeling of anticipation I felt watching Richie rinse the old fashioned glass in preparation for a sazerac, or the deep happiness the feel of the froth of the pisco sour brings me when it hits my lips, or even the wistful yet satisfied feeling I got when I drained the last drops of the bijou (pronounced bizh-OOOh) from its martini glass, but I won't bore you any further - just go and taste (and *feel*) for yourself.  The wine and beer lists will certainly offer you something you'll love, should your tastes run that way.  \n\nIn sum: good food and great drinks served by lovely people in a nice setting for reasonable prices.

The food is exciting and delicious--no tired old dishes that you\'ve had elsewhere.  The service was up-beat and cheerful.  And the food came surprisingly fast.  The restaurant is beautiful and not particularly noisy, even at the height of the dinner hour on Saturday.  I was surprised to be able to get a reservation for such a good place at the last minute, but maybe they had a cancellation.   We picked it entirely based on Yelp reviews.\n\nWe were a party of four and had the following:\n\n1. Rosemary roasted nuts.  A bargain at $5, you get a large quantity of roasted nuts, warm and elegantly served.  One serving was plenty for 4.\n\n2. \'Tender Belly\' bacon fat heirloom popcorn.  Another $5 bargain.  Popcorn like you\'ve never tasted anywhere else.  \n\n3. Crispy Squid. $9.  A pile of lightly-fried squid and a light, delicious dipping sauce.  The pickled fennel on the side is amazing.\n\n4. Mirliton Chopped Salad.   $12.  I seldom like salads, and most are nothing to write home about, but this one was a delightful mix of flavors and textures--including popcorn.  I only used half the dressing they give you because I wanted to taste the ingredients, and that was the right call.  Start out with half and add more of you really need it.\n\n5. For my main course I had the Fair Trade Coffee Charred Short Ribs  $28   The meat was pretty much perfect--crispy on the outside, tender inside.  The parsnip puree and greens were to die for.  No kidding.\n\n6. My wife (and one other person) had the Pan Seared Scottish Salmon.  $26.  She asked for it rare, and it came perfectly rare, though still crisp on the outside.  I had a bite and it was delicious.  There were plenty of delicious beets to go with it, so I had a few of those, and loved every bite.\n\n7.  One person in our party had the Pan Seared Scallops.  $17.  They were large and seared to perfection.  The side dishes were delicious, like everything else.\n\n8  We\'ve been trying to stay off deserts, but couldn\'t resist, so we ordered one of each of the four:  Irish Coffee Pot de Cr\xe8me  $10.  This came in two layers--the chocolate at the bottom and the cream on top, with an embedded wafer.  One of the best I\'ve had.  The Strawberry Pound Cake. $9.  I\'m not a fan of strawberries or pound cake, but this was ordered by someone else and I had a taste and thought it was pretty good anyway.  "Pig in the Orchard" Bread Pudding.   $9.  My wife and I had jokingly said ahead of time that if there was a desert that used bacon, we\'d order it, so we had to order this when we saw the desert menu.  It was unusual and amazing.  Just goes to show there\'s no dish that can\'t be made better by addition bacon fat to it.  Finally, we had the Cookies and Milk.  $6.  There were several cookies served in a paper bag with a glass of milk.  We only tried one, being full by then, and that one was quite unusual and delicious.  We took the rest with us and we\'ll find out tomorrow, but I have every confidence they\'ll be great.\n\nOh, yes, I ordered a Moscow Mule as a drink and it was pretty much perfect:  Served in a metal mug (as it\'s supposed to be, but seldom is nowadays), it  was made with real ginger beer (not ginger ale) and came with slices of cucumber in the mug.  Surprising attention to detail for a $10 drink.\n\nEverything was carefully prepared and beautifully presented,  The staff was responsive and upbeat without being obsequious.  Everyone seemed genuinely proud of the restaurant, and with good reason.  I\'ve spent a lot more money on meals coast-to-coast, and can\'t remember when I\'ve had as good a meal, as pleasant a dining experience or as great a value.  I\'m anxious to go back and try some of the dishes on the menu that we missed this time, and will certainly go back in my next visit to the Phoenix area.', 'business_id': 'MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2011-03-27', 'type': 'review'}

I loved the flavors of my salad the best, but the chopped had a lot of taste going on and the hummus was smooth and subtle (ie-not too heavy on the garlic). Great start to the meal indeed. For dinner, I ordered the halibut and my dinner partners-in-crime ordered the pork tenderloin and the short-ribs. Bites of all three confirmed tastiness once again. To round things out, dessert menus arrived.  We ordered the strawberry poundcake, the bread pudding, and the cookies and milk. And here is where they lost that fifth star. The cookies were terrible. Three of the four were hard as rocks. The spicy chocolate was the only one with flavor that was recognizable. The other three were kitchen experiments gone awry--and not awry in that "this is experimental and new so it must be good" kind of way. Awry in that spit this out and we know why they serve it with milk kind of way. If you are going to have an awesome restaurant and you want to be clever by offering cookies and milk, bake some good cookies. Or buy good cookies.

Not to say that they are bad, but for $13 you can get a much better burger or grilled cheese sandwich at many other phoenix eateries. Another item i was unimpressed with was a Fish and Chips special which was priced at $20. It came out with 2 small panko crusted halibut filets and fries. It was a somewhat decent amount of food when you added the fries to the equation, but the batter was bland and the fish was dried out. Many other places around the valley have much better fish and chips for around half the price.\n\nMoving on to the good menu items, I would have to start with the $32 Filet which is amazing. One of the best steaks I have had in arizona and equal and if not better in quality to one you would get at any high end steakhouses. Other good choices include the scallops, which were cooked perfectly and bursting with flavor. Another one of my favorites of this menu is the chopped salad which is fantastic and a must order.\n\nI would review the desserts but I have never ordered one since none of them on the menu have caught my attention.\n\nThe service is always prompt and professional, they have a beer list and innovative specialty cocktails.

The Stetson Chopped Salad should not only have its own fan page but its creator, Chef Bernie Kantak, should be given a hug every time you see him at his new Citizen Public House. \n\nLocated in what used to be the valleys original Trader Vic\'s, there isn\'t a tiki torch in sight. Instead you\'ll find a contemporary space outfitted with wood accents, leather booths and a stainless steel-topped bar. The vibe is casual and relaxed elevated by outstanding service on every one of my visits. \n\nIf you\'re wondering what a public house is, well simply put it\'s a tavern that also serves food. While they do serve some great drinks and have an excellent wine list, I\'d be hard pressed to call Citizen a mere tavern. How many taverns have you ever heard of serving pork studded Bacon Fat Heirloom Popcorn ($5)? Or how about a pot filled with creamy \'Kilt Lifter\' Fondue ($9) savory hunter\'s sausage, sweet tangy pears and toasted country bread? If you have, please let me know right away.\n\nFor dinner I couldn\'t recommend The Original Chopped Salad ($12) more but if you don\'t like smoked salmon, they can make it with chicken instead. The Mirliton Chopped Salad ($12), a composition including chayote, snow pea greens, tomatoes, popcorn, grilled halloumi cheese; cucumber-onion salad tossed with a tangy parsley-garlic dressing was a fantastic textural explosion but lives in the shadow of its older sibling.\n\nI\'m not even sure where to start with the entrees; I guess it comes down to price point. Take the lower priced lusciously juicy Lamb Burger ($12) topped with a cucumber salad, zesty tzatziki and served with fries, you\'d think with flavor and quality like this would be much more expensive. \n\nAt the other end of the price range sit the fantastically meaty Fair Trade Coffee Charred Short Ribs ($28) complete with a side of brightly sour dried cherry bbq sauce and roasted parsnip puree. Somewhere in between is the juicy "Smart" Chicken ($18) which refers to the brand not the chicken\'s admission into the Mensa Society. \n\nDesserts by Tracy Dempsey were all that and a bag of cookies, literally. Cookies and Milk ($6) were delightfully chewy and come served in a sealed pouch for freshness, of course the milk was ice cold just perfect for dunking. Three words, Strawberry Pound Cake ($9). A thick slice of strawberry olive oil pound cake is lightly grilled then served with vanilla malted ice cream, chocolate sauce and malted strawberry streusel and like the Stetson salad it was Facebook worthy.', 'business_id': 'MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2011-05-14', 'type': 'review'}

It was really good. We had a really good server who was friendly and efficient.  For our appetizers, the BF got the bacon fat popcorn and thought it was fantastic.... I'm not a huge fan of bacon, but it was ok in my opinion. I got the Mirliton salad, which was delicious! It has such a variety of textures and flavors, it had popcorn, chayote (which I had never had), cheese, cucumber, onion and really tasty dressing. I would definitely order that again. For mains, the BF got the pork tenderloin, which was absolutely delicious! I was so mad that he ordered better than me (like usual). It was the pork with mashed sweet potato, chevre, and figs with apple jus... it was so delicious and full of flavor. I ordered the chicken which I absolutely would not order again (that's where the star came off). It was chicken with a corn risotto and an onion and mushroom hash. It was all kind of smokey.... but not in a good way, and did not have a flavor that I liked. The risotto was not sweet like I thought it would be... and all the flavors kind of blended together so you couldn't taste the components. I make a better risotto at home, so I was very disappointed. Luckily for me, the BF shared some of his pork with me. So for desserts the BF got the pig in the orchard, which is a bacon bread pudding with a cinnamon -y ice cream. This was good, but my dessert beat the pants off of it (woot!!). I got the pot de creme. This was the highlight of the meal! It was amazing... it was a whiskey, coffee, and chocolate pot de creme and it was so rich and delicious.... if I could eat it everyday, I would, and I would be fat and wouldn't care..... So overall, it was good and I would definitely come back HOWEVER I would definitely not order the chicken again.", 'business_id': 'MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2011-05-16', 'type': 'review'}

I must say though, I do see the potential and would go back again to give it a second try, but here are my thoughts about my first experience at Citizen Public House. \n\nFirst of all, we went to CPH during restaurant week for a business dinner, so part of my experience may be tainted by the reason I was there. I really felt the initial service was lacking. We wanted to change seats, but our waitress didn't come to our table for about 10 minutes, so we had to ask the hostess to move us. Then, it took another 10 minutes to clear another table, which was empty in order for us to move seats. Once we were seated at the new table, our waitress was prompt, helpful, and extremely delightful. \n\nAs far as the food goes, I was expecting to be blown away based on the reviews. My experiences at FnB and other restaurants in town completely surpassed CPH food. I did love the pork fat popcorn. I had never had something like that at a restaurant and I loved the bacon. It seems that CPH loves bacon overall as it was very present on their menu, including apple bacon bread pudding, which was just alright. I had the smart chicken which was really standard chicken and risotto. My Husband really enjoyed his scallops, but didn't like the coffee pot dessert. \n\nSo, long story short, I would give CPH a second try, but I wouldn't go running back any time soon. I'd say my experience was unique given the trend on yelp.", 'business_id': 'MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2011-05-23', 'type': 'review'}

Overall, it was ok. My expectations were really built up by these reviews, and in relation I was a bit underwhelmed. It's still a good restaurant, but I expected great, so that's influencing my rating here.\n\nAs for the deets... atmosphere was excellent and I'm glad to have a place like this in the area. We had mixed reviews on the food, however. The bacon popcorn was interesting and tasty. The chopped salad was amazing and I agree completely with other reviewers on that one. I would have liked that as an entree size and skipped my main plate. I got the pork sirloin, which was dried out and the flavors were trying too hard. Maybe it was exacerbated by the contrast between it and the salad before it, which was so lovely and subtle in how it came together. I was disappointed. I got my fiance to agree to split the entrees and had part of his Smart Chicken. It was certainly better - well cooked and juicy, with delicious crisp skin on top, but the flavors were overpoweringly earthy - the balance wasn't to my taste with too much mushroom (I love mushrooms but to be fair, these were one of the few kinds I don't like for this reason). As for dessert - I had the bacon apple bread pudding, and though I liked it, some of the bacon inside was too soft and put me off as far as texture. I also didn't like the strong smokiness left in my mouth in the end of the meal. I've had bacon in desserts before that did a better job balancing the sweetness with the meatness and this was just ok.", 'business_id': 'MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2011-05-25', 'type': 'review'}

I have had the pork belly, the filet, the burger, gourmet grilled cheese, hummus, and a few more things. The temperature, portion size, flavors, and prices on everything have been spot on. \n\nFor those of you who are in to the current trend of supporting local and smaller business ventures, I found out that this place was started by a couple of local service industry guys along with Chef Bernie. Bernie uses tenderbelly pork and *Smart Chicken chicken. I googled both to find out why he chose these companies. The deserts are made by a local women and sold at the restaurant. They do change occasionaly.\n\nChef Bernie is also the creator of the famed "Stetson Salad" going by the name "Original Chopped" at CPH. Anyone who is from Scottsdale is probably aware of the popularity of this single item. So if you have friends visiting from out of town, or you are visiting yourself, this is a local fave.\n\nI recently had a bartender friend tell me "I\'m so tired of hearing the term mixologist". It may be overused, but this bar can probably get away with it. I am mainly a wine drinker, but they have a long list of really unique cocktails on the menu and I notice a few new ones added every few visits. Richie is one of those guys where you can say "i had something that was like blah, blah, blah, but have no idea what was in it" and he will probably figure out what you are talking about even when you aren\'t quite sure. \n\nThe last good thing I will say is liking CPH on FB is worth it.

So we stopped in tonight, our 23rd wedding anniversary, after dinner at a French restaurant we wanted to try. Richie Moe, mixologist extraordinare and my drink hero was busy so his apprentice, Chris, made me an amazing drink. But Richie knew we wanted a taste of his magic so when he was free, he came by.\n\nHe remembered me and Yelper Shannon M and how much we enjoyed our drinks. When he learned it was my and Jim W's anniversary he offered us anniversary shots, saying he felt like lighting something on fire. OH MY GOD!!!\n\nHe started out with these two stainless steel pitchers - way too big for a couple of shots. He put in chopped chocolate, added chocolate liqueur and banana liqueur and heated the bottom of the pot. He then gently caught the contents on fire. That's when the real excitement began. He poured flaming liqueur from one pot to the other. Back and forth went the flaming lava-like stream, a brilliant blue and gold. When he was done he poured it into two shot glasses, added some sort of cream and grated chocolate on the top. It was warm, a perfect temperature to drink. And it tasted like a liqueur version of bananas foster. IT WAS FANTASTIC!!!\n\nI'd been wanting to go back since Presidents day. Richie reminded us why.

I was so surprised that a 'American' pub type place would do a good curry. But they did. I was so overprotective of the juice even after the mussels were gone.

Andrew personally sat us at a table, but quickly obliged our request to move to another location that was a little less noisy- a booth had just opened up.  Nice touch, and it was greatly appreciated!  However, as the wait times extended longer and longer, the noise did get to my mother, who was very hungry and tired.  Subtract the long wait times and the excessive noise, I\'m left w/ friendly and accommodating, yet VERY slow service (Andrew said I\'d be able to sub something else for the corn-based sides in all of the "Yelp Eats" menu... I went w/ the dessert-sweet parsnip puree) and fantastic food!  The strip steak, cooked medium, was not overly-seasoned, and Mom was enjoying the meal, which was accompanied by a gorgonzola-corn spoon bread ("just like eating bread pudding"),  stone-fruit compote (apricot), and  crunchy pistachios.  I LOVED the compote, which really added to my enjoyment of Mom\'s entree choice.  I also loved the scallops entree, which consisted of three scallops that were around 1.75 inches in diameter each and sat on the parsnip puree, topped w/ sauteed snow pea greens and a gastrique made w/ Red Rock cola.  The applewood-smoked bacon lardons tasted nutty and had a nut-like mouth-feel, as well.  My first few bites of scallops and puree were lovely, but then the sweetness became too much, since the scallops were naturally sweet themselves.  Mom REALLY enjoyed the scallops (she didn\'t have much of the puree), much more so than the strip steak;  Hearing her hum w/ pleasure made me feel so happy!  :)  \n\nI would love to visit again, but on a less-busy time- it was, after all, first day of "Yelp Eats 2011."  Maybe for lunch?  I also put in a request to add the bread pudding fondue Yelpers enjoyed at the Yelp party held here in February on the regular menu; Andrew said that the venue still served it, but on special events.  While I was not able to enjoy the bread pudding tonight (I intend to visit again before YE\' week ends), I did bump into Donjay S., who had tried it and said it was good, but not as good as the fondue version.  This menu\'s version includes bacon-- I cannot wait to try it!\n\n(*Lost my card adapter, and the photos uploaded using the USB seem to be corrupted...

The service, food, drinks, and ambiance were all spectacular.\n\nFirst, the drinks. There are numerous specialty cocktails, an extensive wine list, draft and bottled beers, aperitif, digestif, single malt scotch, and almost every type of alcohol you could expect. Even unexpected libations that I rarely see elsewhere, such as dessert wines. We had to try their signature cocktails because it seemed to be the right thing to do at CPH. Good booze & good bartenders; can\'t let those go to waste. We had to have something with gin, so we opted for Aviation & Count Negroni. Both were what we expected. Strong & unique. I don\'t see anyone disliking Aviation, but Count Negroni is for specific tastes. Try this if you like strong orange and cinnamon flavors. The Campari in this drink makes a statement.\n\nSecond, the food. We ordered the "Smart Chicken" and the Berkshire Pork Loin. The chicken had a nice crispiness on the outside and had the flavor of lightly fried chicken without all the fat. The risotto, mushrooms, and onions that came with it were amazing.\n\nNow, the pork. The pork! This experience made me fall in love with pork all over again. We all love bacon, but the bland white pork that comes from industrial farms has destroyed its reputation with people who love pork for its flavor, not for its leanness. Granted, I have never had Berkshire pork before this visit, but it was absolutely amazing. They cooked it perfectly. Pink and moist on the inside. The meat was so sweet & tender and the fat was so flavorful. This is due to the quality of Berkshire pork, but also the proper preparation. The stone fruit compote complemented the sweetness of the pork perfectly, as did the pistachios. The gorgonzola/white corn spoon bread was awesome. And the broccoli rabe/chard (couldn\'t tell exactly what it was) was steamed perfectly with great seasoning and flavor.\n\nThird, the dessert. The bread pudding was fantastic! Like the best apple pie you\'ve ever eaten...only better. The ice cream that came with it was great as well. I ordered a cup of coffee as well, from Roastery of Cave Creek called "Black and Tan." One of the better cups of coffee I\'ve ever had. Even my girlfriend enjoyed it, and it had no cream or sugar. She usually loads up the sugar in coffee but she said that the coffee has so much flavor that it doesn\'t need anything.\n\nFourth, the service. Our server, Brian, was very knowledgeable and very courteous. He answered every question we had, gave us the proper attention, and made sure we enjoyed our experience. I can\'t remember a recent experience with better service than we had here at CPH.\n\nOverall, everything you want in a restaurant. It\'s in a great location, in the middle of Old Town Scottsdale. I can\'t compliment this place enough. Just go!', 'business_id': 'MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2011-07-14', 'type': 'review'}

The hubby and I were meeting up with my sister and her husband for dinner at 7pm but we arrived at about 5:30 (it is just down the street from where I work so it seemed a waste to go home first). So, we got to enjoy the full bar experience while we were waiting. The bartenders were super friendly and offered up a lot of great information about the drinks and the food menu. My hubby was very happy that they had Kiltlifter and the Four Peaks Hefe on tap and so was content to enjoy a couple of those but I decided to try the specialty cocktails since I had heard such good things about them. The first one I tried was like a vodka tonic but instead of the tonic they used a sparkling wine in it. I think it also had some orange flavor to it b/c it was served with a curl of orange peel on the rim of the glass. It was so fresh tasting and the bubbles tickled your taste buds so it made the perfect aperitif. Unfortunately I can\'t remember the name of it and it is not on the list on the website. We also ordered some rosemary nuts which were served warm and were absolutely delicious. Basically just fragrant nuts that were ever-so-slightly candied but they made the perfect light snack. I decided to try a more earthy drink next to go with the nuts so I ordered a Moscow Mule. I know others have raved about this drink but I really wasn\'t a fan. I liked the cool cup it came in and I loved the fresh cucumber and mint but the ginger beer that they use is just too bitter for me. I love the taste of ginger but this was just too peppery. The next drink I tried (yes, I like to drink, don\'t judge) was the Aviation and I have to say that this was one of the best cocktails that I have ever had. I am a big gimlet fan (with gin, not vodka) and so this had that nice sour flavor but extra complexity because of the cherry liqueur. It was nice and fruity without being too sweet. Just a really great cocktail and I think I enjoyed it even more because by then we had also ordered some of the bacon fat popcorn which was fantastic. Kind of felt a little guilty seeing all the bacon drippings at the bottom of the bowl but the popcorn itself somehow did not seem too greasy or soggy at all. This really is the perfect bar snack since it went equally well with my fab cocktails and my husband\'s beer. \n\nOnce our dinner companions finally arrived me moved to a table in the dining area. We all ordered off the Yelp Eats menu. My brother-in-law tried the chopped salad and it did not disappoint. My sister and I got the regular salad with different dressings that were both fabulous. I love the fact that they have some unique salad dressing options that are fresh made daily in house. My hubby got the sausage of the day which we had already been informed at the bar is sort of a salad, too. It was basically sliced Spanish chorizo (the hard kind) on top of mixed greens. I have never seen him enjoy a salad so much. For entrees, two of us got the scallops which were absolutely perfect. Really amazing. My sister got the chicken and my hubby got the pork. They were not as impressed as we were with the scallops but they still enjoyed their meals. We were all too stuffed for dessert but I got a cappuccino to sip on while my sister finished her wine and it was tasty though more of a latte since the milk was mixed in rather than floating on top.\n\nI love the smooth, swanky feel of this place.  I was expecting more of a "pub" atmosphere because of the name but it is not like that at all.  I really like places like this that are upscale but not stuffy.  You would feel equally comfortable here in a dress and heels as you would in jeans.  I will say that if the meals weren\'t half off I may have felt it was a little overpriced.  I think I would have just given three stars based on the dinner but the drinks and service we received at the bar bumped it up a notch and I will definitely be back just for that reason.', 'business_id': 'MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2011-07-15', 'type': 'review'}

That\'s the only advice I\'d have for CPH.  They certainly don\'t need any advice on decor, food preparation, or service because all were stellar.

It\'s not a pub and I get that but that sort of "we\'re being cool" irony bleeds over into the menu, the food, and the experience.  \n\nAnother example, happy hour isn\'t happy hour, it\'s "Social.". Yeah, ok.  Awesome. \n\nFurthermore each item we sampled included some sort of out of the ordinary ingredient that seemingly didn\'t belong. This worked terrifically well on the chopped salad.  This dish was just a unique medley I would have never thought to mix.  However the odd ingredient technique fell flat with the pork (fruit??) that was otherwise a terrific dish.  It also didn\'t work with the bread pudding (bacon).  Now, I know what you\'re saying, "bacon is never a bad idea."  While that is usually accurate it was completely unnecessay in this dessert and actually disrupted the flavors.  Strip out those mediocre additions and those dishes would have been perfect. \n\nOverall, while gimmicky the food is executed professionally and if in Scottsdale you won\'t go wrong here.

Our friends arrived before we even had a chance to choose a beverage, so we moved to our table.\nAfter perusing the cocktails, our friends chose a Moe-scow Mule and a Sazerac, while my husband selected the Berried Alive and I ordered the Count Negroni, never having tried Campari.  Our waitress (Gina?) was a delight, telling us about the specials and reminding us the drinks were all hand-made so there might be a slight wait.  Moments later, with drinks in hand, we had appetizers on the way (we chose the sausage of the day and the famous chopped salad, then later added the crab cakes and the bacon fat popcorn).  The drinks were described as "another one of these would kick my butt, but it\'s really good" (Sazerac), delightfully refreshing (Moe-scow Mule) and very good (Berried Alive).  Unfortunately, I was disappointed with my choice.  My husband jokes I\'m the only person he knows who likes the taste of Nyquil and Pepto Bismol, and I generally do enjoy very strong drinks, but the Count proved to be too bitter for my palate.  As if she had donned her Carnac the Magnificent hat, Gina came to check in and suggested if we didn\'t care for our choices, she\'d gladly switch them out.  Oh, yes ma\'am!  I\'ll take a Berried Alive, please. \nThe chopped salad was a pleasant surprise, but I\'m not sure it\'s at the legend status of having its own Facebook page.  The crab cakes were very tasty, my only wish was for a bit more of the aioli.  My favorites were the sausage of the day, slightly spicy and served with braised greens and the bacon popcorn, but of course, how bad can anything be drenched in bacon drippings?!?!\nThe lovely L.C. and I each chose the scallops (at half price thanks to the Yelp R.W. special, quite possibly the deal of the century).  Wanting some wine with the scallops, I wasconsidering an Argentinian pinot grigio or an albarino from the Central Coast (intriguing because most albarinos I\'ve had are Spanish).  Asking Gina for her recommendation, she quickly offered to bring me a taste of both, as well as another Spanish white.  Gina, you are definitely my kind of girl.  While I would have easily enjoyed any of the 3, my top pick was the Central Coast albarino.\nWhen presented with the scallops surrounded by sauteed pea shoots and atop a lovely bed of corn and bacon grits,  we both were delighted with the flavor combination.  Due to a bad experience with scallops several years ago, I had been off the shellfish for quite some time.  Chef Bernie\'s treatment convinced me that yes, scallops are good again.  \nThe boys went with the pork loin (another special) and the coffee rubbed short ribs.  I didn\'t taste the pork, but our friend proclaimed it very good.  I did get my husband to part with a small sampling of the short ribs, parsnip puree and cherry bbq sauce.  Oh my stars, it was quite possibly the closest I have come to the flavor magic that is delicious Central Texas barbecue (for those of you who have had the privilege to sample Smitty\'s, Kreuz, Black\'s and the original Cooper\'s in Llano when those temples of carnivorous delights are at the top of their game, you know what I\'m talking about).\nAfter all of this, we still managed to order 4 desserts.  Our friend is a major chocolate hound and had to have both the Pots de Creme AND the chocolate pecan bars.  It of course helped that they were part of the special menu.  My husband went with the bread pudding (any type of bread pudding/custard/flan/creme brulee are among his favorites).  The delightful Gina also told us about a new trial dessert not yet on the menu: donut holes dipped in cinnamon sugar and served with 3 dipping sauces.  HELLO GORGEOUS, you had me at cinnamon sugar!\nThe donut holes were by far my husband\'s and my favorite, especially when I drizzled them with a bit of each of the sauces (lemon, blueberry and caramel).  Usually a fan of bread pudding, my husband admitted it was not among his favorites.  He said it maybe could have been served slightly warmer   It was probably just because although good, it paled in comparison to both the donut holes and the pots de creme.\nAfter a delightful evening made that much better by the company of our dear friends, delicious food and drink and warm, professional service, we left sated.  We will definitely return, hopefully soon.', 'business_id': 'MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2011-07-18', 'type': 'review'}

We capped it all of with a pot de creme: super rich and just right for sharing.\n\nWe also enjoyed some red wine from Merkin (yes, THAT Merkin), the Maynard James Keenen winemaking venture- kind of neato, I haven\'t seen it in a restaurant before (watch "Blood into Wine" if you\'re lost).\n\nI think this place has a little something for everyone, and for someone like me, it has it all. Its food is artful without being fussy, and the ambiance is cool without trying too hard.', 'business_id': 'MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2011-07-19', 'type': 'review'}

To be fair, I think it's closer to a 3.5 star rating.  Came here with a group of friends for Yelp Eats.  It was a Saturday night and it was both crowded and loud.  The menu is familiar (think of Cowboy Ciao mixed with Kasimeriz's wine nibbles).  There is the famous chopped salad (which I actually like sans the smoked salmon), fondue, burgers etc.  They have a lot of interesting items like blue cheese mac and cheese, pickled vegetables and sausages you don't genearlly see on the menu.  As part of Yelp eats, a portion of the menu was half off.  You really can't complain about the prices.  What I do take a little issue to is the use of salt.  The restaurant uses salt like it is going out of style.  It might have been that night, but everything came very liberally salted.  Also, I love bacon.  However, it seems like 2/3rds of the menu has bacon in it.  To the point it is almost gimmicky.  Although to be fair I did like the bacon grease popcorn, I just thought slices of bacon in my bread pudding was taking it a little too far.  The drinks are delicious.  If I was rating the drinks along, I would have given the place a 4.5\nThe service still needs some work.  It is clear that on really busy nights, the wait will be long.  Make sure you have good friends with you to pass the time away.  I did have to send one item back that was so salty it was inedible.  I was a little sad to see that there was no explanation and it was not taken off the bill.  (A little disconcerning given the fact that we were a large group, consuming and generating a good sized tab).  Overall, good place.  Fun but I'm not sure this will be my regular hangout.  I still prefer places where you don't have to shout to hear your neighbor across the way from you.", 'business_id': 'MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2011-07-19', 'type': 'review'}

I found your heaven!!! My favorite bacon eater brought me here with a couple of friends without noting any sort of hidden agenda. When I saw the menu, I understood why we were here immediately... \n\nOur server stepped up to the table and immediately started describing drinks and dishes to us without skipping a beat. He was educated about the food and it showed-- I appreciate that. He also made us giggle when he walked away from the table saying, "I\'ll get your drinks and oh, I\'ll grab your nuts!"  I must say, their nuts are candied and delicious. Just the way I like them. \n\nSo, my dearest friend was unafraid to try the artery-clogging dishes that he had lined up in his mind, and it started off with the "Tender Belly" bacon fat heirloom popcorn. Fact: It\'s pieces of bacon tossed in with some flavorless regular ol\' popcorn. Does the bacon make it good? Sure. Is it something amazing? No, it\'s definitely a novelty and they are just having fun with it. \n\nNext: We went for something healthy and highly recommended: The Mirliton Chopped Salad. As everyone has said, it\'s deeeeelicious. I wanted to marry it while I was on my salad high (I realized that marrying food just isn\'t sustainable...). Just so you know, it\'s not very big-- I recommend two people sharing it before your main dish. \n\nSandwiches: I got the Halloumi Sandwich. I love cheese, and I wasn\'t certain of what to expect with this dish, so I suppose I really had no expectations. The roll it came on was delicious, the chickpea puree was a great spread, I loved the tahini addition as well, but somehow I couldn\'t love the cheese. It just didn\'t have a texture that I am used to and it wasn\'t a strong enough flavor to balance it out. So...I "hmm" this dish. Not dislike, just..."hmm"...\n\nMy friend\'s dish: Another friend ordered the BLT and the other ordered the Pastrami. He ordered the Lamb Burger. This was described by the server as "gamey" in his initial description. I do not like that word. That sounds like the meat is going to have body odor, soooo I didn\'t order it! Fortunately for me, my friend did and it was a little overcooked for his liking, so we swapped dishes! HOORAY!! It was pure, premium lamb and the tzatziki and cucumber onion salad were complimentary and DELISH. No B.O. here, folks, just tasty goodness. The server took off the lamb burger because of the overcooked factor AND offered to bring him another one that was rarer. What great service! \n\nDessert: Yes, I continued my role as sidekick on the bacon-anza and got the "Pig in the Orchard" Bread Pudding. I was in a coma already, but I decided to just finish myself off with this one. The bacon adds really just another novelty factor to this dish. You could easily have just cooked the bread pudding with some of the bacon run-off and been done with it, the bacon taste would have been enough to satisfy the taste. The bacon chunks=overkill. The ice cream neutralizes it ever so slightly and gives it an apple pie savory appeal.\n\nAs the Bacon-anza came to a close, we were all turning into little piglets before our eyes with rosier cheeks and a light glaze added to our skin... Thank you Citizen Public House.', 'business_id': 'MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2011-07-22', 'type': 'review'}

I came for the Yelp Eats promotion, but one of the more popular items on the menu (scallops) had sold out. Usually, his would not be a problem, but I had already sold myself on the side item for this entree -- corn grits! And needless to say, this southern influenced girl was sorely disappointed not to get my serving of grits :( but no fear, the waitress made sure I got my corn grits on the side.  The rest of their entree items looked fair, but nothing in particular stood out as a must have.  I settled on a halibut dish.  The appetizers list looked a bit more interesting... \n\nThe good:\n- The chopped salad is a must try (this appetizer has it's own Facebook page for crying out loud!)\n- The staff.  We were quickly greeted and sat at our table upon arrival, and our drink orders were taken and delivered to the table in record time.  Throughout our meal, my husband harassed the waitress for different selections of wine -- but she was a good sport. He is forever embarrassing me in public, so any spot that can put up with his drunken shenanigans is a win.\n\nThe not as good:\n- Best looking dish, scallops, was not available\n- My halibut was overcooked\n- We came in on a Sunday, and the place was half empty... But food still took long time to get cooked. I didn't mind this much, as I was not in a hurry. But if I had been on a schedule, this would surely been annoying\n- No cappuccino since machine was broken (boo)\n\nOverall, i'd give this place a 3.5.  The chopped salad and friendly service was enough to make me overlook some of their lesser qualities.  I'd like to go back another time and see whether my experience is different--maybe I just caught them on an off night?", 'business_id': 'MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2011-07-22', 'type': 'review'}

Maybe it was an off night for CPH, and perhaps based on previous reviews, my expectations were too high. I so wanted to give it five stars. I took a friend from out of town there for the last night of Arizona Restaurant Week. \n\nThe Pros \nFood - (5*) The menu choices were fantastic -- something for everyone. We both ordered the Original Chopped Salad and the Scallops. Both were delicious. (FYI - I had the Kantak Chopped for three nights in a row now, twice at Amaro in Cave Creek. It is my new favorite!) The flavors and textures in this salad are perfect. The pan seared scallops were tender, juicy and sweet. Desserts for me were overkill, but it came with the meal. The "Pig in the Orchard" Bread Pudding was delicious, but not as delectable as the Irish Coffee Pot de Cr\xe8me which sent me to Cloud 9. \n\nThe Cons: \nAtmosphere (3*) Even on a Sunday evening, the dining room is really loud. Even though we were sitting next to each other, we were borderline shouting just to be heard. Nevertheless, the design is cool and inviting. \n\nService (2*) Our server had zip personality, made no suggestions whatsoever, and didn\'t bring any bread. She brought our entrees to the table when I was clearly still working on my salad. (One of my biggest pet peeves!) \n\nWill I go back? Absolutely. Based on all the other reviews, this just might have been a peculiar instance so I\'m willing to give it another shot.', 'business_id': 'MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2011-09-28', 'type': 'review'}

I didn\'t want to write a review on that for a few reasons; mainly because it wasn\'t a true dining experience. The food and the cocktails were so awesome that night and the staff was amazingly friendly... I don\'t know what took me so long to come back. \nAt the Yelp event, I love love love loved the lamb meatball (which seems to actually be the lamb burger on the menu) and the smart chicken. It was late night and I wasn\'t starving, so wanted to choose a smaller plate. I have a friend who once told me, "If a restaurant has crab cakes on the menu, order them. If the crab cakes are good, then you know it\'s a good restaurant." I saw crab cakes on the menu and thought of what he said. Now, I already knew this restaurant creates great food so didn\'t need to use the crab cakes as an indicator. I don\'t normally go for seafood items, but had crab cakes once that were delicious in DC and always wanted to taste crab cakes that good since then. I figured there was a good chance these crab cakes might give those DC cakes a fun for their money and I was so right. They were sooooooooo good. I\'m still thinking about them and will be letting my crab cake loving friend know he\'s missing out if he doesn\'t ever get to eat these. \nOh yeah, do you know they have a sausage of the day? Citizen Public House is awesome. \nEach month they have a cocktail pairing dinner that I keep meaning to get to. I love to drink and I love to eat. Smartest idea ever to pair foods with cocktails rather than cocktails to food. So far they\'ve only been on nights where I have to work the next day; which explains why I haven\'t been to one yet. I\'m just going to have to give in and use a vacation day for the following day for an upcoming dinner. \nThe only thing they need to do in order to completely have my heart is serve weekend brunch. Once they do that, they will become my steady restaurant boyfriend.', 'business_id': 'MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2011-10-01', 'type': 'review'}

That being said, both times I was there for events, and both times CPH did a great job.  My first visit was an event with passed appetizers and drinks shortly after they opened, and the other was for a happy hour / sit-down dinner for a group of 45 people, just last week.  \n\nSince it\'s more fresh in my mind, I\'ll go into more detail about the latter visit... We started on the patio and had drinks and some light apps including hummus and flatbread and their delicious bacon fat heirloom popcorn.  (They had vegetarian popcorn as well).  After about an hour, we moved inside to where there were three large rectangular tables set for our group with our own special menus.  We were able to choose from two mini-salads and four entrees and then we had family-style desserts.  I went with the infamous "original Chopped salad" to start and then chose the Pan Seared Scallops as my entree.  I think I cleaned both plates... and those around me likely had order envy as I definitely ordered right!  In addition, service was spectacular... somehow the Citizen staff managed to serve all 45 of us within minutes of each other!  They also kept our waters and our wine glasses full, which I\'m sure added to the experience.\n\nI recently saw a preview of the new fall menu which includes some interesting items such as Chicken & Waffles, Applewood Smoked Duck Breast, and Grits + Gumbo... I will have to head back over there soon to give these things a try... that is, if I feel adventurous enough to order something other than what I know I love (the original Chopped salad and the scallops).

Should have asked if they had egg-beater whites instead.  Both choices were interesting but not anything I would tell a friend about.

Very clean looking, romantic setting if you wanted it, beautiful bar and everything just seemed in place and taken care of. The hostess was very friendly and quickly sat us in the area we requested. From there is where the service quickly took a turn for the worse. \nOur server Amy came to greet us and took our water order? We had been sitting and waiting, reading the drink menu so by the time she came around we already knew what we wanted to drink but all she gave us the opportunity order was water. She returned a short moment later to take our drink order but still no water. We were brought our drinks by another server and halfway through our drinks our water finally came. Not a big deal but why make a fuss about our water order if its going to be brought to the table well after our drink order arrived.  \nMy husband and I were pretty excited about trying the food so we already knew that we wanted to try the Pork Belly appetizers. Unfortunately  once our drinks arrived our server did not return for quite a while to give us the opportunity to order our starter. When she finally returned to the table the exchange was so fast we didn\'t have a chance to let her know we were also ready to order dinner. Once again she quickly disappeared and did not return until well after our food arrived. At that time we were finally able to order our main course. \nTaking a look around the restaurant we started to notice that all servers (aside from ours) were very upbeat, enthusiastic, and just plain friendly. We waited so long for our drinks to be replenished at one point my husband had to go get us drinks from the bar! We counted tables and realized that our server not only had our table but 4 additional tables and a party of 15 or so. It was then clear that our table was picked as the sacrificial table to keep up great service to the rest. We get that sometimes you just get so busy this has to be done, but a simple " I\'m sorry" really goes a long way. Why did this poor girl get no help or support from her team? A manager did not once come to our table to see how we were doing or apologize for the lack of service.\nThe food was AMAZING. I am not really a pork eater but that starter is something I would eat over and over. I ordered the Filet and my husband ordered the Short Ribs. Both to die for!! My husband, being a chef, is very hard to please but there wasn\'t much that he didn\'t love. \nIf I was to rate this place just based on food it would hands down get 5 stars. Unfortunately its not fun to spend that much on great food and have such poor, poor service. Part of my job is to refer both guests and clients to restaurants in the Scottsdale area, and service like this makes me think twice about sending people that way. \nI would return based on the food alone, but I would definitely sit at the bar.

We had initially planned to wash down a bowl of Tender Belly bacon fat popcorn with our outstanding drinks (Richie Moe and his bar staff are the finest I know--but that\'s for a different show).  The popcorn was, as always, a real treat.  Crispy, fragrant, savory, salty goodness.  But then the gentleman beside us was served a pork belly pastrami, and the amazing smell was driving us crazy. So we placed an order for that and Chef Bernie\'s Original Chopped Salad (which he first introduced while at the helm of Cowboy Ciao and which I also find I cannot resist).\n\nThe pastrami is made of melt-in-your-mouth pork belly, and the sauerkraut provided a terrific tangy balance to the richness of the meat.  Typically, the menu at Citizen is stocked with dishes that are familiar but have their own particular twist.  In this case, the sauerkraut was made of Brussels sprouts instead of cabbage. And rather than pile the combination between two slices of rye, it was served with fantastic rye spaetzle (I learned to cook these dumplings in Germany, so I am usually leery of ordering them in American restaurants--but Citizen\'s were outstanding.  Chewy but still tender.)\n\nAfter we finished the pastrami (and restrained ourselves from licking the plate), we dug into the salad.  It arrived on the platter in carefully arranged in rows (basically, a salade compos\xe9e) of Israeli couscous, chopped arugula, tomatoes, smoked salmon, toasted pepitas, and Asiago cheese.  The dressing, which comes on the side, is a sort of slightly-garlicky Green Goddess, very fresh and light.  The friendly gentleman serving us offered to toss the salad.  It seemed a shame to destroy the lovely arrangement, but this is definitely an instance where making a mishmash on your plate is the way to go.  None of the ingredients lost their integrity, but the combination of flavors (sweet, salty, smoky, green) and textures was outstanding.  The crunch of the pepitas with the crispy greens and delicate couscous is as close to salad heaven as a girl can get. \n\nI love desserts but rarely order them at restaurants because it\'s a course that can be pretty iffy.  However, I know that Tracy Dempsey does amazing work for Citizen, so I had to take a look at the evening\'s offerings.  I saw chicory ice cream and salted chocolate caramel sauce with chicory streusel, and any remaining self-restraint went out the window.   What a winner--again, excellent contrast of sweet and savory, perfect portion size for two to share.  My only quibble, and a minor one at that, was with the ice cream, which could\'ve used a bigger boost of chicory.  But then again, not everyone loves chicory coffee as I do.\n\nI\'d be remiss in not discussing the actual space of the restaurant.  It would be fairly easy to pass Citizen by on the street; it fairly disappears into the bland exterior of a white building on the corner of 5th and Craftsman in Old Towne Scottsdale.  The signage, above the entrance on Craftsman, is not easily seen after dark. In fact, when standing out front once, I was stopped by a couple who asked me if I knew where the restaurant was.\n\nThe interior, while understated, is far from nondescript.  The center of the dining room is dominated by a large, stainless steel bar and the vaulted ceiling above with its exposed beams.  Seating options include freestanding tables for four, leather banquettes along two walls, an alcove that accommodates larger dining parties, and my favorite, the very comfortable barstools.  The color scheme is very simple--white walls with dark accents and clusters of artwork hung gallery style.  Still, there is no shortage of warmth in the room.  The staff is exceedingly welcoming and the service professional but friendly.  On peak nights, the acoustics of the space mean that it can get a bit loud, but noise fits right in with the idea that you are in a contemporary "public house."  Citizen\'s combination of a lively dining room with an outstanding, innovative menu, top-notch bar and superb service will keep bringing me back.\n\nSide note: some people seem to be confused about the difference between a "public house" and a sports bar.  If you want to watch television while you drink, I suggest you seek out the latter, as Citizen mercifully has no TVs.', 'business_id': 'MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2012-01-01', 'type': 'review'}

I had my birthday dinner here for a party of 16 on a Saturday night in December.  I had previously tried Citizen during restaurant week but my BF who arranged the evening had never been.  They seated us at a wonderful table near the front of the restaurant in the semi private alcove.  It was perfect, very intimate and I was able to hear everyone and mingle and socialize with my party.  The service was absolutely fantastic - never was anyone in my party left thirsty as our alcohol tab demonstrated at the end of night.  We actually had 2 servers who circulated and made sure that everyone knew what wine was open, etc.  We were there for over an hour before we began ordering appetizers.  When I apologized to the server, saying I hoped we were not taking too long in case there was another seating for the table, he told me not to worry at all, that this was ours for the night.  I like a leisurely paced dinner, especially when I'm the guest of honor.  My BF had bought me a Lisa's Rum cake, and even though they charge a $25 fee to handle and serve the cake, they did a wonderful job.  I declared it the best bday I had ever had :)  \n\nThey are owned by the same group as Cowboy Ciao, which I have been a longtime fan of.  The original chopped salad which has it's own facebook page, yes, yes - they have it, and therefore I have not been able to order anything else to start.  It's just perfect.  I have also ordered the scallops each time I've been.  Corn grits and bacon along with cola gastrique combine with the scallops into the most awesome flavor and texture.  Not at all sweet, but rich and complex.  I also enjoyed their Moe'scow mule and they have a nice wine list.  The BF got the short ribs, and the first time he really really liked them.  I apparently tasted them but I was 2 hours into my bday dinner, and I can hardly remember due to the 2 martinis and countless glasses of wine. When we recently went back a week ago, he again ordered the short ribs, but he seemed less enthusiastic.  I tasted them, and I found the short rib itself to be quite good, tender, flavorful.  I did not care for the dried cherry bbq sauce.  I found it to be acidic and sweet, but not balanced at all.  The smell also turned me off.  I would go so far as to call it pungent.  It didn't compliment the short ribs, and neither did the roasted parsnip puree it was served with.  It was just too sweet.  I applaud their creativity, but in this case it just didn't work for me and I would have preferred something more garlicky and mellow.  \n\nDessert and Espresso were fantastic, have tried the donutbread pudding and also the one with the chocolate pot de creme which I thought was more interesting.

Wanted to check out Cowboy Cio, but then saw the reviews about CPH and decided to give it a try. \n\nGot there at 8pm and was greeted with a smile. Our table was still at 8:15, but the hostess said we could hang at the bar or the stinky patio. Had quick service for a glass of Pinot and Tanqueray and tonic ($20 without tip). OK pour. \n\nShort wait and we were whisked away to a table for 2. Was greeted by Clark who quickly got us more drinks and asked if we had any questions. Good guy, very helpful and honest about his choices. We switched gears to a Lagunitas IPA ($5) and sangria ($8), which was served nicely. \n\nRead about the Pork bellly Pastrami app and the Citizen Chop Salad, so we ordered both. Clark hooked it up so we could have each in courses per say. Pork belly was awesome! C\'mon - rye spaetzle, Brussels sprout sauerkraut = goodness. Citizen Chopped - chayote, snow pea greens, grape tomato, heirloom popcorn, grilled halloumi cheese, cucumber-onion salad & parsley-garlic dressing! Very unique tastes and refreshing. Would like to have that salad in the summer for sure!\n\nMain courses - The Mrs. had the Short Ribs ($28) and I ordered the Meatloaf... yeah, I know... I was hoping for something epic in meatloaf, but it was good. Nuthin special. The Short ribs on the other hand were EPIC! It is served with this dried cherry bbq sauce that you would not hesitate to lick the small bowl dry! The short rib had a dark right out the BBQ pit look. It was AWESOME! Comes with roasted parsnip puree & seasonal veg. \n\nDessert - "DONUTS & COFFEE" ($10) - Bourbon glazed donut bread pudding, vanilla sauce, cafe au lait ice cream, brown sugar streusel... + More AWESOME! If you go, get it! \n\nOverall, A good experience. I want to give it 3.5 stars. Service was prompt, Food was good, but it was the surprises in the ingredients that made it fun. Good mix of people too. The price is a little high by a few bucks for items in my opinion. I mean a $20 meatloaf should have been effin epic - Right?!', 'business_id': 'MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2012-02-23', 'type': 'review'}

I was in a race to Sunday because I knew my Wife and I were going to CPH on Sunday for dinner! \n So we get there Sunday with Reservation. I order a Midwest Manhattan, it sucked and the B-tender noticed I did not like it. He asked me for a baseline of what I liked and made a drink for me based on that. Guess Im a fruit because he gave me something pearish with red bull! It was good. My wife got sangria which was killer.\nWe were with other guests and wanted to try the menu, so here goes:\n\nAppetizers:\n\nKiltlifter Fondue: 2.5/5 - Not a thick fondue....and thats ok because the flavour is sharp, which I like. What I did not like was I could not taste the subtle flavors of the hops and barley.\n\nBernies Mac n\' Cheese: 2.5/5 - Pretty boring. Cavatelli, came to the party underdressed and overpaid. Same mix of ingredients in the fondue. Laughing at myself.\n\nPork Belly Pastrami : 4/5  - This could easily be a five. It just needed a stronger pepper crust to contrast the flavourful fattyness. This dish is excellent. I actually can\'t wait to go back and eat it again. The flavor of pastrami, yet not as smoky as you would find in a NYC deli, as fatty and tender as can be, Oh and the tatses linger....into bedtime!! Not so good...Pastami burps. The rye spaetzle was great and I loved the sprout krout!!! Whole mustard seeds a nice touch!! \n\nChicken and Waffles : 3.75/5 - Really surprised! Loved the waffle. It was a touch small. Crunchy outside, soft middle full of flavour. The blue clover honey is not as fancy as some might think, quite common actually, none the less it is good. CPH may want to sub for a single pass amber. The almond butter was a nice touch. What I liked was the light crust on the chicken, and the chicken was moist, literally juicy.\n\nMeatloaf 2/5 - Terrible. Dry with an over salty demi. Ho hum pot\'s and weak zuzchini. My wifes is better but I wont tell her! Sorry. The two star rating is becuse the portion size is enormous....which, had the meatloaf been good would have busted my gut. But there are some round eaters out there that would like to know that this brick o meat is for you. \n\nLamb Burger 4/5 - Really good. Cooked perfectly, charred a bit on outside with a nice juicy oink center. The Carrier for the beast was crispy, Warm, chewy and soft. Delicious!! Loved the fact that it was like a gyro sans gyro meat. Replaced with a hunk of charred lamb. Good Shit. The fries were great but the ketchup....thats a bingo bitch, what fun!\n\nDuck Smoked 3.5/5 - Cooked perfectly!! Thats always a bonus. Thank you chef! Everthying seemed right here, just did not do it FOR ME! I have had much better but this was good. Definately got the flavour profile balanced. Loved the Kale! Eh...maybe I should bump this to a 4 star dish.  Pretty good.\n\nScallop and Grits 5/5 - Excellent ! I thought I was the only one who could truly execute a perfect tasting scallop. It is my pickest dish and one of the easiest to ruin. They were seared perfectly, cooked just right and all the oceanic, nutty, buttery smooth richness you want from a scallop was present upon first bite. The grits.....hands down the best part of my dinner. Thet were rich, roasty, corny and had absorbed the brine from the scallops almost turning this dish into a grit ala risotto. Weird, delis=cious with a a tongue ascerbic lashing from colas gastrique. Nicely done. I will be back for this soon!!\n\nOverall a great place. Big on flavor, good vibe and it\'s nice to see the workers hanging out and helping out as if you were invited to a buddys house. They want you to be happy!!

That is the only way to describe the food at Citizen Public House.\n\nSo let me start this review with my obsessive love for the Pork Belly Pastrami appetizer. Hands down one of the best things I\'ve ever eaten. This pork belly is just the most amazing, literally melt in your mouth meaty/fatty goodness you\'ll ever taste. SO AMAZING. After tasting this appetizer, I seriously contemplated canceling my main entree and just ordering 5 more of the Pork Belly Pastrami. (Note: I did in fact return a day later to again indulge in the fatty pork belly goodness. SO WORTH IT.) If you order nothing else here, order the Pork Belly Pastrami. You\'ll thank me.\n\nQuick note on the service and drinks so I can continue to rave about the food: J and I came here for a late dinner on Thursday and had really great service even though we were only sitting in the bar area. We again experienced excellent service on Saturday when we returned for a late lunch (and to introduce one of his friends to the incredible food! I spent so much time raving about the food on Friday that we had no choice but to come here on Saturday). J had what he said was an amazing old fashioned, and I tried their signature Citi-Zen which had a great pear flavor and was served with rock candy as a stirring stick. Candy with a drink, that\'s a definite win for me.\n\nBack to the food:\nPan Seared Scallops - Delectable combination of flavors. Salty and crispy bacon, sweet and smooth corn grits, with wilted snow pea greens that added both a nice color and flavor to the dish, seared scallops sit atop all this deliciousness. And then it is all topped with a tangy and tasty Red Rock Cola Gastrique. Did I make the correct dinner choice? Abso-freaking-lutely.\n\nAmaro Meatloaf - J\'s dinner choice. A lovely combination of flavors, but I personally found it to be a bit dry, J loved it though. The mashed potatoes were buttery and delicious. And the roasted zucchini was fresh and very enjoyable. But I would still choose the scallops over this any day.\n\nSo when we came back on Saturday we decided to just order appetizers. Which was of course a good choice because mostly everything we ate was amazing. \n\nWe ate:\nThe Original Chopped Salad - smoked salmon, Israeli couscous, and a bunch of other delicious things make for a very enjoyable texture and flavor combination - one of the best salads I\'ve ever had!\nChicken and Waffles - Think fancy chicken and waffles. Another great flavor combination - crispy chicken tenders with a kick, buttery waffle with almond butter, and all dipped in honey. \nBacon Fat Heirloom Popcorn - It is what it says it is. Bacon and popcorn. It\'s tasty, but only worth it if it\'s during "Social Hour" when bar snacks (and draft beers) are half off (so when this is $2.50).\nGrits + Gumbo - The only dish I didn\'t really like. I have to say I was pretty disappointed with this one. I felt like it could have been so much better. The grits were tasty, and the andouille sausage was okay. But the gumbo itself seemed kind of like a thick but not very flavorful chili. I would skip this next time.\n\nOur friend that came with us on Saturday had the BLT and said it was outstanding. Which I would imagine it was, seeing as how the bacon came from the same company as the pork belly!\n\nThis review is extremely long now. But I swear, this place absolutely deserves all the praise! I suppose I\'ll stop now but I\'ll end with this...\n\nOrder the Pork Belly Pastrami!!!', 'business_id': 'MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2012-02-28', 'type': 'review'}

I was excited that they had chicken and waffles(as being a huge fan, and eating at many chicken/waffle places, i.e. Roscos in LA, LoLo\'s, etc.) I must say, honestly... pathetic. the chicken was over fried, dry, burnt and thigh meat to top it off. The waffle was a tiny 3inch square, with not syrup, but honey. And rather bland as well. Upon stating my dis-satisfaction to my waitress, she offered me my choice of different food from the menu. I chose the AZ BLT, per her request. And, I was blown away. the bacon was orgasmic(for lack of better terms), it buckled my knees with its perfection of tenderness and semi salty flavor. As a man who loves crispy bacon(almost burnt), this was a dance of flavor that is matched by few. The combination of the fresh greens, campari tomato, carmelized french bread and aioli mayo made this "basic" classic dance on the tastebuds.

I don\'t know if everyone else here just came on a better night with a different staff or what, but this was not the dining experience you all described. The food was just OK, not awesome or Earth-shattering. We had a variety of appetizer plates - mac n cheese, crab cakes, chicken & waffles - that were way overpriced and just average at best. We didn\'t get the pork belly because they wouldn\'t serve it without the sauerkraut - made from brussel sprouts!?! (seriously?) The server also raved about the drinks there and the "awesome mixologists" but the bar selection was tepid (no Sapphire, only Beefeater?) and they couldn\'t even make a mojito? I know that can be a  \'specialty\' drink in some areas but we saw plenty of them on other menus around Scottsdale. But the worst was the service and attitude of the staff; we were IGNORED all night. The server was affable and friendly but would disappear for long stretches of time. 20 minutes to get drinks, when the bar wasn\'t busy?? And our appetizers took almost twice that long to appear. He also forgot the bread, and didn\'t ask about another round of drinks until we were ready to leave! The place was a little busy but hardly packed (it was after 9pm), so we couldn\'t figure out what was going on.  It seemed like everyone working there was more concerned with enforcing the cool hipster vibe than actually doing any work. Except for the hostess - whose job apparently involved stomping through the restaurant periodically and angrily glaring at us like we were keeping her from something far more important. Seriously, we barely interacted with this woman (other than to ask for a table) and yet we were ducking the daggers shooting from her eyes all night. WTF was that all about? Look, any restaurant can have an off night; maybe they were short-handed in the kitchen or something.

Although I might\'ve enjoyed it more if I didn\'t have the Im-port first.\nOur waiter was good and checked on us often, except when we wanted bread and he forgot to bring it to us. I\'ll let it slide though, because he was so good otherwise and brought us tons of other "yummy" food and drinks quickly after we placed the order and I applaud him for that on such a busy night (the end of restaurant week this past Sunday).', 'business_id': 'MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2012-05-30', 'type': 'review'}

The food was meh. And the sangria was meh.\n\nIn fact, the highlight of my meal was when one of the cute bartenders (at least they have that going for them) delivered our drinks instead of our server.\n\nThe interior is bare bones and plain. The white walls are covered with a smattering of vintage photographs you'd have to squint to see-from a table not by a wall, the atmosphere isn't artsy, it just looks like bad decorating in someone's living room. I didn't really understand why butcher paper covered the white tablecloth-covered tables, since that sort of took whatever class the spot had and negated it. The seating wasn't comfy, and even though there was a patio, it was tiny and overlooked a parking lot.\n\nThere weren't many vegetarian menu options on the small American menu, so I opted for a Grilled Cheese ($12). My gut told me to leave off the Peruvian Sweety relish, a weird red mixture, but I kept it on because I figured it had to contribute to the sandwich somehow. I was wrong. It tasted gross, and I ended up scraping it all off and wishing remnants weren't still stuck to the sandwich. I got it with a non-noteworthy salad, and I've had much, much better artisan grilled cheeses that were less expensive and more filling.\n\nMy friend said she liked her chopped salad, the same one I've had at Cowboy Ciao (it's a creation of Citizen Public House chef/owner Bernie Kantak, who used to cook at Cowboy Ciao.) I also liked it there, but it's so tiny, I can't justify paying $12 for it-especially since I'd leave the meat off.\n\nLike I said, the sangria failed to leave a big impression on me, other than that it wasn't strong. For $9 a glass, I expected something with a little more kick to it but was left disappointed.\n\nI can't think of any reason I'd tell someone to go to Citizen Public House. If the atmosphere had been a little prettier or livelier, maybe it'd be a fun destination, but the company I had was the only thing that kept it from boring me.", 'business_id': 'MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2012-07-07', 'type': 'review'}

Many of the appetizers come served in bell jars and are meant to be shared and explored. Looking for more standard fare, don't worry, all the regular appetizers are  1/2 off during Happy Hour as well and you can still find some signature items here to try also.\n\nMay we suggest the Tender Belly Bacon Fat Heirloom Popcorn? Once again remember that all regular appetizers are half off during Happy Hour. Dig yourself some comfort food? How about Chicken and Waffles? Buttermilk-marinated fried chicken on oat waffles covered in almond butter and blue clover honey. Another must try item on the menu is the Kiltlifter Fondue.

On to third period, a study break with the Lost in Translation cocktail, an immensely lush melding of tequila, yuzu juice and lemon peel. Fourth period delivered scallops on roasted corn grits with--you guessed it--more bacon! I\'ll just say this about the scallops: the best I\'ve ever had in the waterless West. Oh, and I couldn\'t remember all the answers so when the teacher wasn\'t looking I had a bite of Aimee\'s Amaro meatloaf, which made me so fat it almost got me expelled. \n\nI seriously considered skipping fifth period.

The decor and feel was very empty and sparse.

The whiskey concoction I had started to as well, until I realized they did have 12 and 18 year Jameson reserve but told me they didn't when I asked if my drink could be made with that.\n\nThe recommendation to have the Chopped Salad pretty much was the most amazing thing ever.

Score!\n\nWhat we got:\n- house hefeweizen: just a little more "hoppy" than I\'m used to, but still crisp and refreshing. Plus, it was only $2.50. \n\n- chopped salad: have you ever had a salad that has its own Facebook page? Didn\'t think so. \nThis was a very colorful and delicious mix of chopped smoked salad, Israeli couscous, toasted pumpkin seeds, arugula, and fire roasted tomatoes.  They mix this at tableside. What an explosion of flavors and textures: creamy, salty, smoky, nutty, soft, crunchy. \n\n- Pork belly pastrami - GET THIS!!! This is a popular choice, with succulent pork belly that melts in your mouth. This is paired with fried spaetzle, and saut\xe9ed brussel sprouts. \n\n- chicken and waffles: chicken thigh meat, fried to golden crispy perfection with rice flour. Comes with a small waffle with a dollop of savory butter.  Served with a small ramekin of honey. If you aren\'t a douche, they might give you a bit of maple syrup as well. Extra bonus!\n\nThis place is definitely worth checking out.', 'business_id': 'MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2012-11-11', 'type': 'review'}

The customer service is up there as the best I can imagine ever experiencing, honestly they set the example for treating their customer perfectly.  The reason why I wasn't happy was the food was not very impressive.  The chicken and waffle app was good, but not that great, also the chicken was raw in two of the chicken strips.  I have to mention our waitress did a great job making sure to apologize and take the charge off the bill because it wasn't edible.  I ordered the meatloaf, my older sis ordered the lamb burger and my younger sis ordered the truffle grilled cheese.  We are the kind that share tastes so we all get a chance to try a few things.  I ended up trading my meal with my older sis because she liked the meatloaf a lot. So she likes meatloaf different than I do I guess, but what I didn't like was the gravy, it wasn't that good.  I liked the lamb burger more, but the meat wasn't seasoned well, it couldn't get a salt hint from it at all, but the topping helped to add flavor, and it was good overall.  The fries were good, but I feel like if In-N-out or five guys makes better fries, they aren't impressing me much... The ketchup was soooo good though, I am not a ketchup eater much (I mix it with mayo for a Utah style fry sauce), but this spiced one was very yummy.  The truffle grilled cheese was again, good, but not great, it also lacked seasoning or any wow factor.  Last the dessert, the apple pie was very good, not the best I have had, but solid apple pie.  The dream pudding cup was not good, it was very griddy, like very very griddy.

With the 4.5 Star rating we decided to try it, before reading the reviews. We called and were able to get a 9 pm reservation, which allowed me to do some more shopping. Perfect! \n\nWe arrived and were immediately seated. However, we kept getting the wind from the entrance. We asked our server if we could move, and he was more than accommodating, and we had a new table in just a couple of minutes, even though the place was very busy. The new server was just as great. You can tell, they focus on providing an awesome dining experience through service. I LOVED THIS!\n\nThis is what I didn't like - the place was so loud, that we couldn't have a conversation. In fact, I got a headache before our food even came out. There are two factors at play - the bar is in the middle of the restaurant, and when people drink they get loud. Also, they have high, open ceilings, without anything to 'absorb' the sound, so the loud laughing and all conversations, bounced off the walls. This esculates as the place fills up and when it is full, like it was last night, everyone is talking and laughing louder than normal, to the point where I heard people almost screaming. All this is bouncing off the walls, giving me one large headache. So there we sat, in silence, texting each other and facebooking because it really was too difficult to have a conversation.  \n\nAfter looking at the menu, and asking the server if they have hamburger, we found out they only had lamb burgers. While the reviews are good, they really aren't our thing. So much for Gourmet Burgers. We felt the menu was limiting, and our eyes were more focused on the desserts than anything else. The appetizers also looked better than the entrees, it seemed that there wasn't that much I liked, or if I did I felt it was overpriced. However, we were hungry and you yelpers love this place, so we decided to try a couple of entrees. We ordered the Chicken and Waffles appetizer (for the kid), while we split the scallops and the buttermilk chicken entrees. \n\nWe also ordered bread, which brought my attention to the fact that there were no salt and pepper shakers on the tables. I happen to like a little salt and pepper in my olive oil for the bread; which tells us, as foodies, the chef thinks that everything is prepared to the perfect seasoning and you don't need salt and pepper shakers. I will tend to disagree. I probably should have asked for them, I am sure they would have brought some, but I didn't.  \n\nOur food came. I got 3 scallops for $24. They were fantastic; however, 3 scallops and some greens, no matter how good, is not worth $24, maybe $14. Thank goodness we split the entrees! I thought the buttermilk chicken was good, but not outstanding and liked the corn, it had a bit of a kick. However, I will say I do not like brussel sprouts, and I liked these (A+ for those). I sampled the kid's chicken fingers and I LOVED it! You can tell it was prepared in-house. The kid didn't care for the chicken fingers all that much but he loved the waffle, it was gone in about 30 seconds. And I felt the $10 price was spot on. The hubby actually didn't care for chicken fingers, but really liked the buttermilk chicken and he also loved the scallops.  \n\nBecause all the desserts looked amazing we had to try them. Again, I was a bit disappointed; they all had great flavor; but nothing I would crave again. The pudding jar was such a unique dessert, but I felt like I was eating peanut butter out of the jar, and I was hoping for something a bit lighter...a pudding consistency. The apple pie was good, but it was all crust, it needed more filling. The gingerbread pudding - very good! (I was not disappointed, even the ice cream was awesome).\n\nSo, has you can see, I am torn in the review because there were some things that were truly outstanding, where others fell short. I liked the concept, I like what they are trying to do with the menu, I like the d\xe9cor and I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED the service. I wish there were a few more entr\xe9e selections. I would not rush to go back here, but I do want to go back. Also, I wouldn't recommend bringing your children, especially if they are picky like mine is!", 'business_id': 'MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2012-12-16', 'type': 'review'}

The wine was perfect with the cherry sauce, besides the fact that pinot is a classic pairing with duck.  A glass of Siduri for $12 is a great deal, too.  I loved the way the duck was prepared, too, and it did not weigh me down afterwards like duck often can, either.\n\nMy wife had the buttermilk roasted chicken along with a glass of their creative (and delicious) interpretation of sangria.

I was only ok, but it was also only about $2 or so.  We decided to have the pork belly pastrami and the butternut squash soup.  The soup was ok, but I wouldn't order it again.  The pork belly was amazing.  I can't wait to go back and have it again. We shared the short rib.  It was a pretty healthy portion.  My husband and I were able to share one.  The bbq sauce was a tad bit on the bitter side.  I think I will try the scallops next time.\n\nThe cocktails were amazing.

It was excellent bacon and added salt to the popcorn.

I really enjoyed this dish, in fact this is the best dish I had and will order it again.  If I could do it over I would just order this dish and my drinks and I would of gave it five stars.   However please read on....\n\nOK also ordered the Butternut Squash soup and it was ok.  Not really great, just an ok dish that I would never order again.  It just did not have any spectacular flavors or any wow factor like the pork belly pastrami.\n\nI also ordered the main entree short rib.  It came with a cherry sauce that I would never eat again.  If you smelled the cherry  sauce directly it would clear your sinuses.  It was so strong that if you inhaled it directly it would make you cough.  Not really an appetizing sauce.  It had a bitterness to  it that really was not good at all.  After coughing twice from breathing in the sauce with my short rib I stopped using it all together.  The short rib on its own was ok.  Not worth the coin and only an ok dish.  I would not order it again.\n\nThe atmosphere of Citizen Public House is great.  Very lively and great service.

Maybe I\'ve been stuck in the suburbs for too long, but I was so impressed with Citizen.  I finally had a chance to check it out, and during "social hour" no less.  I had been hearing about those barrel aged cocktails, so I had to give one a try.  I don\'t normally go for the bourbon and whiskey cocktails, so the waiter recommended the Pacific Coast Cocktail, and described it as "sort of their version of sangria".  It was really good, really strong and $5 to boot (during social hour).  I had to switch to wine after that because I didn\'t want to get completely wasted in front of a bunch of strangers.  I also took the liberty of ordering the bacon fat popcorn for the table because Holy Jesus.  Bacon.  Popcorn.  How could you go wrong?  You can\'t, and this was truly sent from heaven.  Or hell, maybe.  Either way, it was freaking amazing and I would eat it every day if I could.  \n\nI ordered the Short Rib, much to my boyfriend\'s chagrin.  I always seem to order what he wants, and then he has to order something else (sorrynotsorry).  Oh Lord, not to be a yelp stereotype here, but it was TO DIE for.  Short Rib?  Amazing.  Parsnip Mash?  Why didn\'t I think of this?  Swiss Chard?  Yes.  And it is gluten free, for those of you on that food trip.\n\nOur waiter was totally on top of things, made great suggestions, and was super sweet.  Basically, everything I ask for in a waiter.  And the atmosphere?  Yes, it has that "cool, hipster vibe" described by other reviewers, but I like it, and I didn\'t find it pretentious or snobby at all.  \n\nOverall, I want to go to CPH like EVERYDAY, but alas, I cannot.  I will settle for going as often as I can to enjoy their delicious food and libations.

The waiter offered the risotto that comes with another dish as a veg entree so I went with that. The risotto itself was kind of bland, but the earthy mushrooms on top made up for that. My husband loved the scallops and said the grits they came with were the best he's ever had.\n\nWe went for the peanut butter dessert which was a decadent combo of chocolate ganache and pb mousse. There was way too much ganache for my taste. It was hard to dig into the dessert, but it still tasted good, especially with the tasty crumble on top.\n\nTwo things I loved about CPH: our enthusiastic server and the space.

I came here last Friday (2/22) to take advantage of the last day of AZ Cocktail Week. Usually this place is really busy and it's hard to get a table without a bit of a wait. Thankfully, we made reservations! \n\nThis place is so cool. The atmosphere is really hip and classy. I had been here (and Citizen R + D) a few times before but wanted to wait until I tried the food to make a review. \n\nI had the Negroni cocktail, which was..alright.

I've had their Moscow Mule before and the Cotton Cooler (at R + D) so I'm confident in their cocktail skills. \n\nThere aren't too many veg options on the menu. There were a few things that caught my eye though-the mac n cheese and the grilled cheese sandwich. In the battle of which cheesy dish to select, I went with the grilled cheese since it seemed like a healthier option (the only healthy aspect being that it came with a field greens salad). Let me just say..this might've been the best grilled cheese I've had IN MY LIFE. This sandwich was not only melty cheese goodness, but had truffled mashed potatoes and onions on it. The salad was pretty delicious too, but the sandwich was definitely the standout. \n\nThe service was really good and our server was very informative on the menu & friendly.

Two of us stopped by this place on a Tuesday evening while on our business trip after consulting Yelp. Even on a (mid)weekday evening, the inside of Citizen (although not full) was very lively (as opposed to other restaurants that seemed empty!). I love the fact that they had a list of MANY cocktail drinks for you to choose from. The waitress was great at recommending some vodka-based cocktails that my friend would like as well! For food, we opted for:\n\nAppetizers: 1) Pork Belly Pastrami and 2) Chopped Salad. Both dishes were excellent! The pork belly was tender and with a mustard-based sauce and a bed of vegetable (I forgot what the veg was) while the chopped salad was so refreshing! (probably the bacon made it taste so great!\n\nMain dish: 1) Seared Scallops and 2) Crispy Steelhead. The seared scallops were also great and came with saucey looking food of what tasted like mashed potato. The steelhead was actually a fillet (instead of whole fish) and I love their green pea risotto that came with it. Honestly, I actually like their appetizers more and thought the main dish was quite large (well, since we had 2 appetizers already!)...but the food was very good still!\n\nDessert: Pina Colada Bread Pudding (heaven~~~)...tasted/smell of toasted coconut was so aromatic after we took a bite of dessert. I'm normally not a dessert person but since the food here was so good (both appetizers and main dishes), I was glad we tried their dessert out, too!\n\nAll in all, the bill came to around $90 without tip including 2 cocktails)...really reasonable!! highly recommend this place as a place to hang out!

Looking at the menu ahead of time, I was drawn to the bacon fat popcorn and figured either this would be awesome or it was going to be an absolute bacon-trend disaster of a meal.  It was outstanding.  We arrived and the place was fairly busy.  Definitely energetic but not to the point where one couldn't carry on a conversation without shouting.  Started of with some of the house cocktails and bacon fat popcorn and the kilt lifter fondue.  Cocktails were strong, yet balanced and flavorful.  The popcorn was ridiculous, not greasy or over-the-top, with pieces of crisp bacon scattered throughout.  The kilt lifter fondue was equally tasty.  We decided to try several items off the starter menu- waffles and fried chicken, pork belly pastrami, and the original chopped salad.  My co-worker went nuts over the fried chicken and waffles, saying it was some of the best he's ever had (must have been good because he's from the south and knows his way around a fried chicken).  Now, I'm a guy who knows a thing or two about pastrami and making pastrami with pork belly just didn't seem, well, kosher.  If there was ever a case to plead for allowing pork to become kosher, this would be the dish you'd have to serve the Rabbi.  It was insane and would make even the staunchest Rabbinical authority issue a blessing.  I didn't try the chopped salad, but the person in our group who ordered it said it was outstanding.

We started with the pastrami appetizer. The flavor was great, but the meat was a straight up slab of fat. I mean, it was the type of fat that you cut off your meat and push to the side of your plate. I would never knowingly purchase a slab of fat, so it was pretty disgusting. When I asked what was in the chopped salad, they explained to me that it had salmon. Since I like Salmon, I ordered it for my entree. The problem was that the salmon was not the grilled kind, like I had figured it would be, but the smoked slimy lox and bagel type of salmon that I hate. It was all mixed in my salad, so I just did my best to eat around it, but it was pretty hard to do that and it ruined what seemed to be an otherwise great salad. I think they should tell diners what type of salmon is in the salad. My husband ordered the lamb burger and his response was "Meh."

As a result, we did a $50-per-person fixed price menu that featured a choice of one of two salads, one of four entrees, and a chef\'s selection on dessert.  As my friends will tell you, I eat out 6-8 times per week all over America and at nicer restaurants a couple of times a month...I\'ve never seen one of these menus get you less food than I got last night.  (This had that "Restaurant Week for dinner in DC" feel to it; DC folks know what I\'m talking about!)\n\nPart of that was tied to dessert.  I\'m allergic to nuts.  Bottom line, the chef\'s selection featured three desserts that all featured some form of nuts.  (I don\'t think a nut allergy is particularly rare these days...do you?)  I asked our server--who was otherwise an excellent host for our large, somewhat unruly group--if I could just get something plain, a chocolate cake, or a cheesecake, or sorbet...anything.  The answer was a flat no.\n\nThat affected the rest of my thoughts on the meal, really.  I\'m normally a cocktail guy but I opted for a glass of the pinot grigio, which was fine...but from reading some of these Yelp reviews, it looks like I should have gotten a cocktail.  The salad (field greens) was fine, a little overdressed but the greens were tasty.\n\nThe entree was, frankly, an injustice...for a fixed price menu that also featured a 7-to-8 oz. steak and the biggest piece of chicken I\'ve seen not on top of a waffle in Chicago, the scallops were puny.  I mean, beyond puny.  THREE SCALLOPS?  I literally took a small bite a minute, just to stretch out the amount of food on the plate.

Next up, a plate of tender and rosy duck given texture not by crisp skin but rather crunchy pistachios and millet nearly the texture of mashed potatoes tinged with rosemary and bitter greens.  Not to be outdone, my mother\'s meatloaf was rich and artistically plated; a classic texture made unique with rich herbal/earthy notes to balance the briny demi-glace and pork.\n\nHeading to the home stretch and opting to outsource sweets to Tracey Dempsey, a wise move made by many local kitchens, I think I can confidently say that what landed before me was good but what was presented to my mother is a dish she still talks about today - a layer-by-layer temporal change in texture and flavor that was not quite a budino or a pot de cr\xe8me, nor a parfait - just a decadent sweet-meets-salty amalgam that was truly amongst the ten best desserts I enjoyed in 2012; a reason in and of itself to visit Citizen Public House...amongst many others.', 'business_id': 'MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2013-05-03', 'type': 'review'}

The food, drinks, and our server were amazing and if it were not for the unfortunate experience with the management staff, I would have highly suggested this place to anyone. Because we had a larger party, they had explained while making the reservation that they could only do one check, but would take multiple forms of payment. When the check arrived, we went through, and wrote down what items went on which card, so the server would easily be able run each card for whatever the total would have been. A few minutes later the manager comes back, sets the cards back on the table with a calculator and says that they were not going to do the math for us, and to figure it out ourselves. After we did, I approached the managers again to explain how unprofessional and rude that was, given they have computers that could have easily done the math for them had they not chosen to be lazy. They went on to tell me that they were "very clear" when we made the reservation that they were not going to split the check...which was not what we were asking them to do when asking them to do some basic math. They went on to tell me how "lucky" we were that they even got our size group in on such short notice.

I have worked in the restaurant industry for the last 5 years, and when I explained that in my experience I had never worked at or been to a restaurant that would ever toss a calculator on a table and tell the guests to "figure it out themselves," the woman said she "encouraged me to eat at those other restaurants then."

I generally don't know where to begin, so let me start with the item that drew me in.... Bacon Popcorn.  If you read my reviews, you know by now that popcorn is my favorite food.  My second favorite is bacon.  When a place takes those 2 things and puts them together in one dish, it won't take much to make me a fan, for life.\n\nWhen I walk in Citizen Public House and pull up a seat at the bar, I feel like I'm in a craftsman style supper club.  The interior of the building itself is beautifully appointed, yet simple with those beautiful wooden beams.  There is a lovely patio area as well.\n\nI've dined on several things from the menu.  I've gone for dinner with reservations and I've stumbled in late night for a bowl of popcorn and libations.  \n\nBy far my favorite thing on the menu, save the Bacon popcorn, is the Chopped Salad.  I enjoy it every time I've gone.  I'm a creature of habit and it is hard for me to order something different at a restaurant when I've found something I enjoy a lot.  HOWEVER, I love it that I have some adventurous friends and I've managed to try several of their drinks and menu items.  \n\nI like the fact that they host a monthly cocktail tasting.  Come in and taste their crafted cocktails for about $65 with some food pairings.  Their drinks are adventurous, but to be honest, I've had better crafted cocktails around Phoenix.  \n\nI would give them 5 stars, but I did order something once that was not prepared correctly and I had to convince the server that it wasn't.  I didn't have to twist his arm but he tried to tell me that it was correct and etc, but I said no, I don't think so.   I suppose after the server took it to the back and examined the food item more, he discovered I was right.  They remade the item for me and the night kept going.  But that makes me wonder if the menu is being prepared correctly.  I wouldn't know, probably never will since I'm stuck on that salad. (SN: I think their chopped salad has a facebook page.)   And the menu doesn't change often enough.\n\nAnother downer is the fact that there is no audible music.  I'm on the fence if I'd want it there or not, but when I've gone, I notice I look around thinking, we could use some atmospheric music.  I also think that place would rock with a really good Jazz band playing live music there.\n\nPlease don't get me wrong, this place has excellent service.  \n\nThe fact of the matter is that I will definitely be back  CPH has the chance to earn 5 stars from me.", 'business_id': 'MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2013-05-06', 'type': 'review'}

Definitely executed well, the recipe itself is blah, won't have again. \n\nChopped salad- everyone raves about this salad, and it's good, but it's really not that good at all, it's own facebook page? ah sounds like a fad to me, the dry freezed corn in it is a let down, it's crunchy sure, but the seeds are enough crunch in there, but actual corn like grilled off the cob would have given this salad a gravitas it really needs, ground it, earthy it up, because it's  very light, it's got lox and seeds and etc so it's got various textures, but somehow nothing stands out so it's like a pleasant mush in your mouth, i think most of all it could be improved by a better dressing than the generic ranch it comes with, i might have had an entirely different impression of it if the dressing was lighter, sweeter, more acidic and again perhaps more peppery or spicy-sorry to say but this salad didn't stand out for me, and i live for salad\n\nWatermelon salad- very different, never had anything like it, worth having just to try, beautiful on the eyes, but really is more of  cheese and watermelon plate, playing on the old and wonderful combo of fruit & cheese, take a bite of your watermelon with a bite of the cheese and maybe a salad leaf, it's tasty. \n\nScallops- Good normal well assembled dish....TOO MUCH BACON, must the gorgeous delicacy of a well prepped scallop always be obstructed by bacon? Over wrought, I feel like this trend ought to be retired, i get the appeal of surfy turfy plates, but scallops themselves are enough, i don't need them floating in bacon fat(not literally, they are served beautifully) surrounded by chunks of piggy, it's not that clever bringing the demise of these very contrary creatures onto the same playing field, we get it, none of gods creatures are safe when humans crack open their cookbooks, the novelty has long worn off for me, decadence is better served by letting one or the other shine, and not having them struggle on a plate for attention like two adopted siblings. \n\nGrilled cheese sandwich - Sort of awesome if you are willing to take in about a weeks worth of fat and cholesterol, it's stuffed with mashed potatoes, you can taste the cream in them, truffle oil, caramelized onions and cheese, bread is soaked in butter cooked with egg, it's rich as hell, tastes really good, i could go with a little less rich and  little less butter, but i am not sure if the function of a good grilled cheese sandwich is not precisely to be rich, so i am torn. I think though i would have enjoyed it more if it wasn't such a heartattack cubed on a plate, came with a cute salad i enjoyed, and strange throw away veggies that looked better than they tasted.\n\nBread Pudding: We had to send it back, may be the worst i ever had, and that's rough but not an exaggeration. Hard dry old tasting coarse bread situation with icecream on top. Huge let down and not consistent with the quality of the food they served prior to it. i expect something of sublime quality even if not to my taste, but it was just a yucky afterthought. \n\nPros: other than the Bread Pudding food is quality, carefully assembled, thought out fresh and pretty. Everything is Cooked right. Service GREAT \n\nCons: Bread basket, stale and boring with surprisingly not good olive oil. no way to start a meal.\n No coffee drinks other than espresso and no milk variations other than whole. a non fat latte would have really made my night. \n\nHappy dining.", 'business_id': 'MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2013-06-24', 'type': 'review'}

Located in beautiful Old Scottsdale, this wonderful gastropub is beautiful and trendy, and the food is to die for!  Our server Chris was amazing and recommended the Chainbreaker brew on draft since the Four Peaks Hef was no longer available, and it was delish and we both had two.  We started out with the bacon-fat heirloom popcorn, which my wife didn't care for, but I loved.  Hey, I'm a guy and there was crumbles of warm bacon all through it.  Then we both split their famous chopped salad, which Chris brought to the table unchopped and chopped right before our eyes.  Honestly, I got cold chills with the first bite!  Hands down one of the best tastes ever in a salad, with salmon, tomato, arugula, couscous, etc. (recipe on Facebook,) and delicious homemade Buttermilk ranch dressing--perfection, and we could have eaten a whole one but wanted to save room for more delights to come.  Chris recommended the scallops, which I had already had my eye on, so my wife ordered the buttermilk roasted chicken, served over sweet corn-butter succotash with roasted Brussels sprouts.  Moist and delicious!  My scallops were wrapped in Tender Belly Hampshire bacon, nestled in a bed of roasted corn grits and topped with wilted snow pea greens (yum!) and drizzled with a cola gastrique.  Tenderest and most tasty scallops ever.  By the end of the night manager Owen stopped by to visit--he had been staring at our names for over a month on his bulletin board and he wanted  to put a face with our names.  Chris joined us for the sit down and we had a wonderful conversation. Wanting to try the peanut butter bread pudding, Chris recommended the Guiness pudding jar instead, which was a stout infused chocolate pot de creme over a chocolate shortbread cookie, topped with Irish whiskey crema and two chocolate shortbread cookies on the side, and served in an actual small jar with lid. I threatened to take off Chris' hand when he reached to clear the plate with the remains of the last cookie still on it!

The truffled grilled cheese is amazing layered with gooey cheese and potatoes. Do yourself a favor and add bacon which really takes this sandwich to the next level adding texture and some needed salt.

I\'m sad to report that our experience lacked the luster that I was so looking forward to. :(\n\nOff of the Late Night menu we ordered the ribs, wings, and hummus & tzatziki. The ribs had nice texture, but there was no flavor to it at all! Same with the wings. It literally tasted like the wings had been sitting on the counter the whole day, and someone just threw a bunch of extra sauce on top of the wings before serving it to us. Not pleasant to eat at all.\n\nThe hummus & tzatziki, though? Very good. \n\nWhat really disappointed me about this meal is that it seemed as though our server KNEW that the food was going to turn out pretty badly. He asked us if the food we ordered was enough for us, but never asked if we were enjoying the meal. When I proceeded to let him know that I thought the food was "okay" his response was...and I quote..."yeah, but is it ENOUGH?" I didn\'t think it was a very polite or appropriate response.\n\nIt also didn\'t help that he got our order wrong...twice. He even asked us to repeat our order three times, and he still brought out the wrong dish.

I didn't even bother eating the third scallop....it was sad :(  By friend ordered the Pacific Rockfish, it was cooked fine, but it was bland and the other stuff on the plate really didn't add anything or make it taste any better.\n\nSince we were celebrating, and still hungry because we didn't eat all of our sub-par entrees, we ordered dessert.

I am wondering if that was the regular size or a smaller portion as part of the meal.  The scallops were huge so getting 3 is no biggie, I am actually about to eat the rest of it.  My hubby got the lamb burger, he loves lamb, and it was really good but a little greasy/oily on the bottom.  He liked the fries with the cardamom ketchup but I didn\'t care for them, but I did really enjoy the "pickles".\n\nThe restaurant is open but with that come loudness, the acoustics aren\'t very good.  Really liked how the bathroom looked and how the stalls didn\'t make you feel like you were trapped in a tiny box.\n\nThe host guys were super friendly, both on the phone and in person, I called today to make a reservation but ended showing up an hour early.  Bussers quickly came by with water and Kent introduced himself as our server.  Dinner started a bit disappointing and my side plate was dirty but then became much better after the first round of food came.

When I first went to Cit pub almost a year ago I was enticed by their Moscow Mule served traditionally in a copper cup, with a garnishing of a sugar sucker. It's a very good mule. I tried the chop salad and while all my girlfriends die over it, it's not my thing. I didn't enjoy the separation of flavors and didn't overall like the ingredient mix, but I'm sort of particular so I encourage you to try that salad for yourself. It's pretty famous. I had the chicken entree which has a delicious sauce, was not dry, and had a lovely hash type bean and brussel sprout thing on the bottom of the plate.

Everything was excellent even the pickled okra and pickled watermelon rind.\n\nMy plate of Pacific Rock-fish with curry millet and stewed okra and tomatoes was delicious as well. The fish was fresh, seasoned and prepared well. The curry millet was a curry for curry lovers meaning full strength flavor and was an interesting healthy alternative grain to use. Bird seed just never tasted that good before. I sort of feared stewed okra because I have had it before and didn\'t enjoy it\'s texture but in this dish it was enjoyable and anybody would like it because it had a fresh crispness to it and picked up the delicious sweet flavor of the small tomatoes.\n\nI was too busy with my plate to try my husband\'s Amaro Meatloaf but he said it was very good and also enjoyed the potatoes. he said, "they taste just like your potatoes" I take that as a compliment.\n\nThe waiter described a very refined adult style nut butter and boozy fruit sandwich as dessert that I wanted to try but unfortunately I was too busy with my plate to have room for it. \n\nVery very good  don\'t know if everything on menu is as good as what we tried but what we tried was excellent.', 'business_id': 'MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2013-12-08', 'type': 'review'}

I truly want to love it more than I do and because if that I've been here about 3 different times. I almost wish I could write two seperate reviews. If I were writing this simply on the drinks the service and the atmosphere I would give them a solid 5 stars. I just feel like for me, the food is a hit or miss. \n\nThe first time I came in was for my boyfriends birthday. We eat out almost every meal and were so excited to try Citizens public house. I had called before hand to make the reservation and they seated us in a great location.  The service was top notch. I dont remember our servers name but he was fantastic. We ordered three smaller plates to share and every thing was just ok. \n\nThe Chop Salad: Our server told us we had to try it. This is something that they are known for. We both thought it was good but not overly fantastic. I honestly expected more. Presentation wise it was really pretty\n\nThe Kilt Lifter Fondue: So-So once again not overly impressed. The idea of fondue is fun but i wanted just a little more. \n\nThe Truffle Grilled Cheese: They honestly need to take this off the menu. It is aweful. It tasted like someone just put a huge mass of potatos on bread and called it a day. DO NOT ORDER THIS. \n\n PB&B Pudding jar: Yum im a fan. Im a sucker for anything with caramel and bannana and this hit the spot. \n\nI dont remember the drinks we ordered but they were all great. They know what there doing behind the bar. \n\nWe left that night a little dissapointed. I still left the server a great tip because he was awesome and deserved it but I wish the food had reflected the service. \n\nOk So now for EXPERIENCE #2:\n\nI came in with a girlfriend for restraunt week and had a Fantastic time. We were seated in the same great place as before. Our server this time wasnt as great as the guy Id had before but he was a gem. They have somewhat of a pr-eset menu for restraunt week so heres what we ordered: \n\nSquash soup: Not always on the menu. It was a little bland but over all good. Its hard to make butternut squash soup pop. I was happy. \n\nThe Pan Seared Scallops: OH MY GOSH YUM. These scallops are fantastic!!! The corn grits they are served on are to die for and the cola gastrique is Awesome. This dish is killer and I would come back for them. I even ordered them at thei sister restaurant the gladly. \n\nAmaro Meatloaf: The meatloaf was huge!! I only tasted one bite because it was my friends but she loved it and the bite I took was great as well. Tasted as good as moms meatloaf!! The only quam we had with this was My friend had asked to switch the veggies it was served with and our waiter just  flat out said no. She could have at least asked the kitchen for us.\n\nPB&B Bread Pudding: I feel like it was different than the first time id had it. Maybe not in a jar? Still good though!!\n\nNow for the drinks: The Sangria here is the Bomb. I dont know what they put in it but man is it good. I also love the Citi-zen cocktail. So Yummy! and they put a rock candy stir stick on top which is so cute!!!\n\nIv'e also been in before just to sit at the bar for drinks no food and the experiances are always good. Like I said before the guys behind the bar know their stuff.\n\nAlright so I have mixed feelings, One Blah experience and one great experience. Im conviced that the main courses here are all awesome and we just oredered the wrong items the first time so I still reccomend this place to people.

I guess I didn\'t read the menu closely because they changed the dish....and not for the better - instead of warm, creamy millet or grits under the duck - the duck sat on top of luke warm diced "sweet potato" hash that tasted like it had been prepared hours ago and not a cherry in sight.  Now an amazing dish is just average and I won\'t order it again.  One of our guest had the short rib and it looked as if it had sat under a light for a while - dry....he said it was ok.  I felt bad since I encouraged him to order that dish based on past experience.  The meatloaf was the only consistently good dish this time. \n\nThen, since it was a special occasion, we ordered the chocolate brownie dessert....I love chocolate and brownies but this was over the top sweet - I had one bite - our two guest the same and my hubby finished it because he didn\'t want to leave it.\n\nWe will probably give CPH another shot to redeem this experience but it won\'t be for a while and I certainly won\'t order the duck if it is still prepared with the hash.', 'business_id': 'MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2014-01-08', 'type': 'review'}

Not wanting to embarrass anyone - we went with it ... but they should make note of that in the order and serve accordingly.  My short ribs were under-done - meat was cooked - but - short ribs require long and slow cooking to melt away the fat and leave the yummy goodness.  My meat was so loaded with fat that I spent most of my meal trying to find lumps of meat that were edible and separate from the heavy fat layer.  Fail.  The seasonal veggie appeared to  be swiss chard or something similar - tough - long strings - not a lot of flavor - not tender.  The parsnip puree was good.  Another diner had the meat loaf that the server praised.  Large portion - but very dense and not a lot of flavor - saved by the sauce from my short ribs.  Another companion had the filet and greatly enjoyed his.\n\nDrinks:  Moscow mule - so so - not overwhelmed with that.  The Citizen cocktail was enjoyed.  The Tilia malbec, Mendoza, Argentina wine - "one note".  Not good, not enjoyable.  Those who had the Sazerac really enjoyed that - though it was a very small serving in a small glass.  \n\nService:  Our server was great - but almost too "animated" for my liking ... but over all (other than the salad situation) - service was good - though it took a LONG time between courses and also to have plates cleared.\n\nAtmosphere:  Nicely decorated and in a fun area of town.  BIGGEST complaint though is the noise level.  We couldn\'t hear the conversation of the folks sitting on the other side of the table - this after moving once to find a more quiet table.  There\'s nothing in the space to help deaden the sound - hard surfaces floor to ceiling - and perhaps - the architecture of the ceiling is the culprit.  Patio would have been nice - but it was taken by a private party.  Men\'s room needed a splash of clorox by the urinal ... Lastly - it was a bit on the warm side.\n\nNot sure I\'ll go back ... hate to risk a good evening at these prices.  Wish I could have had the meal so many others seem to have enjoyed.', 'business_id': 'MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2014-02-26', 'type': 'review'}

I'm not really a meatloaf person, but thought it would be good and it was.  Scallops were also very well done.  A friend of mine ordered the mac n' cheese and didn't like it.

I did not really like the dark rum cocktail.  The scent reminded me of rum and coke, which I never cared for when I tried it many, many years ago, and when I took a sip, did not get the satisfying cola taste at all, and instead came away tasting very bitter dark rum.  It certainly wasn't as unpalatable as I make it sound, since I did finish half of it.  I just wasn't a fan.  If you're all about getting drunk fast though, then this might be a drink for you!  Next time, I'll just stick to wine.\n\nWhen I felt the buzz coming on after only a few sips, I decided to go with the table bread that everyone had passed on earlier.  This prompted orders of Kiltlifter fondue and bacon popcorn from everyone else-- so happy!!  The cheese fondue paired the best with the toasted cubes of bread, although I skipped on the pear that Chrissy P. was loving!  (Pear doesn't like me very much.)  We all raved about the farmer's sausage from Shannon's (sorry, forgot the whole name).  The spice level was perfect!  Wished there were more slices on the plate!  I skipped on the popcorn (corn allergy), but I did try a sliver of bacon-- it was floppy, not crispy, so I left it on my plate.

The New Amsterdam was intoxicating in a good way. Complex and delicious, deftly made with obviously excellent ingredients.

A flavor packed, beguiling, complex offering served over rye spaetzle and brussel sprout sauerkraut. Big and bold but well designed.\nEntrees across the table included the Amaro Meatloaf and two Lamb Burgers. The Meatloaf was big, earthy and warming. A generous serving, worth the sporty $20 tariff. the veal demi-glace and mushroom cream delivering a rich arc, while the potatoes and roasted zucchini supplied the ideal sweep for the meatloaf. Lamb burgers were excellent with an exotic compilation of Serbian lepinja roll, pickled cucumber-onion,\ntzatziki. Enough so that a request was made to attempt replication at home.\nDessert for the table was the PB&J Pudding Jar. Joyous companions all!\nThe service was very friendly and attentive while not overpowering, knowing just when to service the table.

Very interesting yet high quality ingredients were used to make delicious  cocktails. For dessert, my mom absolutely loved the pb and pudding, which is saying something because she's extremely picky.

Good soft bread with really good olive oil that was medium bodied and had a nice flavor to it... not just a regular plain olive oil.  I thought it was a bit earthy with notes of grass and herbs.\n\nWe shared the Chopped Salad and it was just the right size for the 2 of us to start with.  It had Israeli CousCous and pumpkin seeds in it which are different and struck just the right notes to change up an otherwise plain salad into a tasty salad with different dimensions to it.\n\nI enjoyed the Scallops on a bed of creamy polenta.  I pretty much licked the plate.  The Scallops were succulent and sooooooo good! \n\nHubby had the special which was a cashew encrusted halibut.

Our server let us sample some barrel cocktails, which was helpful because they were strong and I didn\'t end up buying a drink I wouldn\'t have been able to drink.  They give you free bread.  Not a big deal you say?  Maybe not, but I\'ve been to a lot of nice restaurants that make you starve while waiting for your food, so it is nice when a place doesn\'t nickel and dime you into starvation.  Am I right?  So we had the fondue for an appetizer and some happy hour cocktails. If you like Swiss cheese, you\'d dig the fondue, otherwise maybe choose something else.  The Cherry tart pinot noir is fab IMHO.  So I bit the bullet and ordered the chopped salad.  OMG.... nosh-a-licious!  It was really, really good.  The mixture of textures and flavors was so satisfying and, I\'m not going to lie, I don\'t get all that jazzed up over salads usually.  My husband had the special - the fillet burger - and I\'m pretty sure his eyes rolled into the back of his head in delight.  I believe the exact quote was, "This is the best burger I\'ve ever had".

It's a very popular item and I tried a bit and it was great (not as good as my scallops though). We both practically licked our plates clean... and he's not much of a food lover ;-p\n\nWe were stuffed, so no room for dessert, but I WILL be back when I'm in the area again.

My girlfriend and I came here for an anniversary dinner and we were not disappointed.\n\nThe ambience here is quite nice.  There was a fair amount of space in between tables but it was still very cozy.  Our waiter was excellent and helped to recommend some dishes for us to try.  We started with the chopped salad.  If you haven't tried this, you need to.  It was fantastic.  They bring it out to the table with all of the ingredients lined up separately and then they mix it in front of you.  It was one of the best salads I have ever had.  From there, I had the seared scallops and she had the smoked duck.  Both were outstanding.  The scallops were served medium rare I believe and were very tasty.  The duck was tender and juicy and had a great flavor.  We also tried some dessert.  We shared the brownie and the one with the pudding and graham crackers.  Both were very good though the brownie was very rich. (I am not sure if they still have these on the menu).\n\nI had the Manhattan listed on their cocktail list and it was by far one of the best I have ever had.  So much so that I had 2 of them.  My girlfriend had their cocktail that comes with a sugar/candy rim and rock candy (the Citizen).  They have a great selection of cocktails and beers here.\n\nThe waiter, again, was on point.  I want to say his name was James? Either way, the service was excellent and we will definitely be back.

Unfortunately, the food was not up to the same standards.\n\nWe walked in on a Monday night and the place was largely empty, which worked well for us. We sat outside on the patio, which was well lit and nicely appointed with a great view of the restaurant itself. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful.\n\nI ordered the Deep Sea Red Crab Cakes to start, and really admired the flavors. The crab cakes were well cooked, and the red pepper aioli added an unexpected but delicious kick. Unfortunately, there was just far too much aioli on the plate, making it the star of the dish, not the crab itself, as it should have been.\n\nAs it was quite late, I decided to skip an entree and just order another appetizer as my main course. The butternut squash gnocchi with pecan pesto and brown sugar sauce sounded amazing, but it was probably the worst thing I have ever eaten in a restaurant. The gnocchi seemed to have been deep fried, so they lacked that soft, melt-in-your-mouth taste that I love in gnocchi. They were chewy and meaty - in fact, when I passed one to my husband, he asked, "What kind of meat is in this?" The "sauce" was a very light slop that did little to mask the texture of the gnocchi. I actually had to stop eating because I thought I was going to be sick if I put another one of those gnocchi in my mouth.\n\nPerhaps I just didn\'t order the right things at Citizen, but I can honestly say I will not be returning for another go.', 'business_id': 'MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2014-05-09', 'type': 'review'}

I wanted to lick the jar of that pudding dish, it was so yummy. \n\nBasically my experience was just so so, would I recommend it if someone were to ask me where they should eat in old town?

I usually don\'t leave reviews after a single visit but given the scenario, I thought why not.\n\nThis place is very good. Even in the cut throat restaurant business in LA, this place would make the mark.\n\nThe food is all great. I tried the lamb sandwich, meat loaf and short ribs. The short ribs were outstanding, and for 30 bucks, it was also a steal. Very strong beef flavor. Meat loaf was also among the better meat loaf dishes i had ever tried. It\'s pretty hard to make meatloaf taste "not boring" but the dish here was solid. The lamb burger came with battered fries which were very good with the homemade ketchup which was like a marinara. I\'m surprised battered fries aren\'t more popular. The appetizer was my favorite: the pork belly pastrami. Very rich, not for everyone but portioned appropriately. \nService is great, ambience is perfect not too loud, not too quiet. Not too bright, not too dark. Price point is fairly accurate.\n\nWhat makes this a 5 star rather than a 4 star however are the mixed drinks. They are spectacular. I had a \'Manhattan\' which was perfect. So good that it hit me hard without me noticing. The \'career ender\' was also good. \n\nIt\'s hard to maintain 800 reviews and still have a 4.5 star overall but I certainly see why this place succeeded in doing so. Next time I\'m in old town Scottsdale I\'ll stop by again for sure.', 'business_id': 'MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2014-07-31', 'type': 'review'}

Seriously, I think they put bacon on everything! Popcorn made with bacon grease and bit of bacon, bacon dessert, bacon drinks....Bacon is the way of life at Citizen and there's nothing wrong with that!\n\nI usually hit up Citizen for Happy Hour after work. They have great prices on snacks & appetizers (we always get the fondue and flatbread), plus the Happy Hour drinks are 1/2 off and some of their specialty drinks are also cheaper. For a great Happy Hour, check it out.\n\nThat said, I always said I wanted to go to Citizen for dinner, it's just a bit pricey for a college graduate who's paying off student loan debt. I finally had a chance to be wined and dined at Citizen a few weeks ago for a work event. Man, was I impressed! Going to dinner and having work foot the bill is the best - we went all out!\n\nWe started with all of the Happy Hour snacks. Fondue was my favorite (can't go wrong with bread, meat, and melted cheese!) but the bacon popcorn was amazing as well! Again, BACON!\n\nFor the main course, I had the scallops. They were perfectly prepared, lightly seared, with veggies and a delicious garlic mashed potato puree. Gah, my mouth is watering just thinking about it! Coworkers had the lamb burger (which is to die for, I guess) and the pork chops. Again, looked super delicious - the presentation is amazing!\n\nDessert was the chocolate mousse thingy. It was decadent and rich, but we definitely ate the whole thing!\n\nFor the lower class, dinner is a bit pricey, but for a special night out (or every night, if you're Bill Gates) I highly recommend Citizen! If you can't afford dinner, opt for Happy Hour and you'll get to experience the delight of Citizen.\n\nSide Note - I've also had the mac-n-cheese and it's to die for!

It was completely unexpected. We truly enjoyed the delicious food and service was OUTSTANDING. I rarely identify people in my reviews, however Gary deserves the praise. From the moment we sat down, he was friendly, charming, and attentive. His positive attitude and demeanor was infectious and it absolutely made our dinner more special. Even as he tended more tables, he hustled to get to everyone. We were so pleased.

All bar snacks, draft beer, and glasses of wine are half off, their barrel-aged cocktails are $5, and three appetizers are discounted. We were dining unusually early since we wanted dinner before the Jason Mraz concert, however, we were able to take advantage of the Social.\n\nRuben opted for a pint of Anchor Brewing California Lager ($5; H/H $2.50). I settled on The Craftsman ($12; H/H $5) made with Barrel-aged Jameson Irish whiskey, Cocchi Americano, and Charbay Green Tea Aperitif.\n\nRosemary Roasted Nuts ($5; H/H $2.50): A mixture of nuts roasted with rosemary. Great flavor and a wonderful snack to munch on while having a couple drinks.\n\nBacon Fat Heirloom Popcorn ($5; H/H $2.50): The popcorn was very lovely and the addition of bacon and its fat was scrumptious. Another fantastic snack!\n\nThe Original Chopped Salad ($12): Smoked salmon, Israeli couscous, arugula, trail mix of toasted pepitas, black currants, and aged asiago, freeze-dried corn, marinated roma tomato, and pesto buttermilk dressing. Wowza! I knew the salad was popular (I mean, it has its own Facebook page), but I didn't expect to be hit by the combination of flavors and textures. It is so, so good and surprisingly light. Great dish to split as an appetizer. The recipe is available on their page, but it's much more complex than I thought and it's one I'll leave to the professionals. I would absolutely return just to eat this salad again..and again.\n\nButtermilk Chicken ($20): Roasted Smart Chicken breast, Brussels sprouts, truffle oil, sweet corn-butter bean succotash, and Pecorino. We chose to also share our entree and our server was kind enough to split it for us. The chicken was moist and flavorful, the succotash was creamy, and the brussels sprouts were perfect. All the flavors worked and it's probably one of the best chicken dishes I've had.\n\n(All their desserts are made by Tracy Dempsey Originals, a local company creating sweet and savory confections)\n\nBacon and Peach Hand Pie ($11): Candied bacon, salted Bourbon caramel ice cream, and peach jam. The pastry was perfection combined with the sweet and salty bacon, ice cream, and not-too-sweet peach jam. Fantastic dessert option!\n\nBag O' Bacon Brittle ($10): The Original Bacon Pecan Brittle packaged to go. My family and I love brittle (and c'mon, bacon?), so I picked up two bags to take back to Vegas. I haven't had a chance to indulge yet, but I will update when I do!\n\nI highly recommend dining at Citizen Public House.

Glad we listened to him, it was fantastic. Great flavor, you can tell they use high quality meat.

This was during restaurant week. I loved dining the first time and was excited to dine the second time. This time around I tried the Bacon Fat Heirloom Popcorn for $5, their Fair Trade Short Ribs which is prepared with a coffee rub, dried cherry bbq sauce, roasted parsnip puree & seasonal veggies for $30; and their Bread Pudding for $6.\nThe Bacon Fat Heirloom Popcorn was regular popcorn with bacon bits and fat. If you\'re a bacon lover you might want to taste this. It\'s a simple snack to munch on while reviewing the rest of the menu. \nHmm how shall I put this ....... I can only equate the entree dish to nothing but "Fair" - exactly as it says!! And I didn\'t get a fair trade at all either for $30. It was coffee rubbed so dry and over cooked that my jaws  were gnawing on each piece pretending to like that darn meat! I dipped each piece in the cherry BBQ sauce but it was still parched and punishing experience to the mouth.\nLuckily I had asked for the bread pudding which was well hydrated served with strawberries and cream. This is a restaurant week dessert not in their main menu. \n\nThe final straw of the evening was the check for a party of 9. At the bottom of their menu it states in fine print: Split checks unavailable for parties larger than 8. First of all, the waitress allowed one person in the group to have their own separate check leaving 8 people left. If you allowed one person then you must do for the rest at the same table.  Was she afraid she wouldn\'t get her 20% or more gratuity? If the waitress allowed one person in the group to have their own check the group becomes 8 people or less. Which means we CAN technically split the check any which way. Instead the waitress proceeds to tell us she can\'t do that. And on top of that she proceeds to tell us that we need to calculate our own tax and tip!! You mean to tell us that a nice sophisticated restaurant lacks a POS system with zero capabilities of generating the math for you?!?!?! \nHere\'s another kicker: At the bottom of the original receipt the waitress hand wrote herself a 20% gratuity. Again, the POS system lacked being able to incorporate the added gratuity on a receipt and the total cost. I find that a shocker. After the whole fiasco and doing our own calculations and making it inconvenient for us diners we were glad it was over. The experience overall was a disaster but the bacon popcorn and bread pudding made up for a bit of it. \nMaybe a hit and miss type of deal. :/\nNever dine here with a group more than 8.', 'business_id': 'MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2014-10-18', 'type': 'review'}

I thought I would share it on Yelp, so I copied and pasted...\n\n\n\nI first want to apologize for taking so long to write to you to tell you about my experience. I was there for my birthday dinner on May 10th, 2014. My boyfriend had called to make reservations and get everything squared away without my knowledge. He couldn't keep it a secret anymore, and about an hour before the reservation, he spilled the beans and told me that we would be going to Citizen Public House for dinner. Right away, I remembered that this nice guy named Sam, who we had met through the gym, said he had worked there. I don't know Sam very well on a personal level, but we do say hello in passing at the gym. I suggested he call to see if Sam was working so we could sit in his section. Sure enough, our request was accommodated and we were seated in his section. He recognized us right away and was pleasantly surprised that we were there. \n\nSam had asked us if we had dined there before, which we had not. I immediately made a comment about how everything on the menu looked good. Since he somewhat knew us, he asked if it would be ok for him to remove our menus from the table and allow him to surprise us throughout the night. I was stunned, and accepted his offer without any hesitation, giving him our full trust. He knows that I like eat healthier, so he informed me that he would be making some adjustments to the foods he would be choosing. Regardless of healthy eating, we splurged a bit, and Sam bought us tasters of some wine so we could choose a bottle. I enjoyed the options so much that I could not choose! ... but I did :) and it was wonderful!\n\nThe first thing Sam brought out was your famous Chopped Salad. I have no words to describe this, other than the fact that I could probably eat this salad every day for the rest of my life. This was the one thing I was told about Citizen Public House, and was told that if I went, I had to try it! He brought it for us to split as an appetizer and I was happy with his selection, as we had wanted it right from the beginning. For the entrees, Sam brought us modified versions of the Buttermilk Chicken and the Amaro Meatloaf and described them fully upon arrival. We definitely would not have gotten the meatloaf off of the menu if we had chosen, but both were so amazing!! I couldn't tell you what he did to modify them specifically, but they were made to cater our health requests just a tad. Un...bel...ieve...able. To top off the night, Sam asked if our special food needs could be catered by a nice desert, because he said he wanted to celebrate my birthday with us. We hesitated, but then decided that we can't say no and would make an exception this one night! I am so happy that he asked before, rather than surprising us with dessert (yes, I know it usually goes the other way around), but it showed he cared about our requests. I don't think this dessert was on the menu, but it came in a jar and I think it had some peanut butter something in it... amazing, candle lit and all. \n\nOverall, my experience was beyond amazing. Not only was the food, drink, music, and ambience great, but Sam was exceptional. I don't think he took care of us just because he knew who we were... I truly believe that that is genuinely how he is as a person and a server! His knowledge is incredible, he is calm and confident in his performance, and he is willing to take a step above to make his guests happy. The funny part about this, is that I am also a server/bartender at a mid-high scale restaurant... and I can honestly say that Sam blew me away. I don't think any of our servers are up to his level, not even myself. You have a great employee on your hands and you should be proud to call him one of your staff members. I have been in the industry for 10 years now and I have never gone out of my way to write about how amazing someone is, but Sam is really that great!! We will definitely be back, and Sam is no longer just a guy I know at the gym, but he was one of the reasons why I had such a fantastic birthday this year and I will never forget the role he played that night.\n\nThank you so much for the amazing experience!!! I refuse to keep my mouth shut about your amazing restaurant and Sam's service!!!", 'business_id': 'MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2014-10-20', 'type': 'review'}

We got the famous chopped salad for an appetizer to share, the pork chop and the scallops.  The 'famous' chopped salad was really quite good and a nice twist on a something of a staple.  Really liked the presentation before it was mixed... not as pretty after they mix it, but tasted great.  The pork chop was a bit dry and overcooked, but the portion was healthy and the sides were quite good.  The scallops were extremely well done, and the mix of flavors in this main was really good.  Serving size was on the smaller side.\n\nAmbiance:  Really very nice. We arrived early for dinner and had the restaurant largely to ourselves until near the end.  Very nice furniture, setting, etc.  Good music (blues) that went well with their overall theme.  People showed up on all types of attire, but I'd suggest business casual type attire to avoid feeling under-dressed.\n\nService:  Really very good.  They remembered that we had a show to get to and were very conscious of getting us out and to the show on time.  The waitress was attentive, pleasant, and had good suggestions.   They were finishing up preparing for the dinner rush during out meal and the bits and pieces we overheard, the attention to detail was really quite impressive and more than we expected.\n\nPrices:  Considering the neighborhood, etc. not horrible, but not cheap.  $100 for 2 drinks, an appetizer and two mains.  I'd say the $$ rating is off...it should be $$$.  I'd be impressed if you escape for less than ~$35/person and I'd bet that is an uncommon occurrence.\n\nTip:  You really need to try the chopped salad... it really does deserve the hype.\n\nNet:  Great place for a night out if you're going to hang in Scottsdale for the evening or first date (trying to make a good first impression).

We were seated next to a fairly loud group (not uncommon for Scottsdale on a Saturday night) who seemed to be having a good time discussing the merits of whatever their latest business ventures were and whose volume was not increasing much so chose to keep our appointed table. \n\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant was noisy and boisterous, and seemed to be filled with an interesting crowd of people. Half of them were a bit older and begrudgingly eating dinner out that evening and the other half were young  professionals. There was music playing overhead but it barely registered for most of the people there (one woman I overheard in the restroom was audibly surprised to hear it playing for the first time that evening.) The wait staff was incredibly attentive and pleasant-- the waiter introducing himself and shaking our hands was an interesting way to start off the meal. \n\nAt our server's recommendation we started off with the Pastrami Pork Belly (for him) and the Original Chopped Salad (for me.) Both were very flavorful and the salad presentation was a fun twist. \n\nFor an entree I selected the scallops, and he had the short ribs. My scallops were flavorful and well prepared, although the wilted baby kale which sat atop it was difficult to cut into in order to pair the two for a bite. The scallops were nested in a corn grit mix and the plate was drizzled with an interesting gastrique that was a little too sweet for my taste- I'm more of a vinegar fan. \n\nThe short ribs were rubbed a little too generously with coffee with very little extra flavor to add to it; the dipping sauce which was provided to flavor it was a little too salty to enjoy with the meat. Accompanying was a parsnip puree that neither of us were excited about. We agreed the appetizers were the best portion of the meal. \n\nThis seems like a great place to take a group of friends for apps and drinks to begin a fun night out in Downtown Scottsdale, but isn't really the type of place I'd recommend to anyone looking for a romantic and quiet dinner.", 'business_id': 'MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2014-11-16', 'type': 'review'}

Lights will be dim, noise will be loud, but everything around you is modern.  If you're looking for a quiet place, Citizen Public House is not it.  But if you're ok with the high energy and noise you'll love it.\n\nService - Our server was better than great.  He was very accommodating.   We made reservations over the phone for a large party, and he secured a semi-private room for us and let us put in several appetizer orders ahead of time.  Throughout the meal the entire team went above & beyond, making sure we were ok, talking about our love of food, and making sure our experience would be perfect.  1 Star.\n\nFood - The appetizers rule at Citizen Public House.  I think it's ridiculous that a SALAD has its own Facebook page.  Then I ate it.  It was ridiculously good.  The presentation itself is great, and once the servers mix it together, it becomes a fresh, modern, texture packed bite.  I will admit I doubted it but now I'm a believer. Bacon fat popcorn.  Yes.  It was even great the next day.  Pork Belly Pastrami - tender, well-seasoned, and could have been my main meal.  Which is funny because looking back, I enjoyed all the appetizers a lot more than the main courses.  The scallops were good and my short rib was not as tender as I would have liked, but after our appetizer fest it really didn't matter.  Bottom line is the pre-meal is where I'll put my money in the future.  1  1/2 Star.\n\nWill I Return? - For the apps!  Not sure the main courses are worth it for a return visit, but I would come back and order the same delicious starters as I did that night.  Now, Citizen Public House is not cheap, so that's all I would be able to afford.   1/2 Star.\n\nMy Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts):\n1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm.\n1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point.\n2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food.\n1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return. \n\nEach Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.  I will sum them up to provide my final Yelp score.", 'business_id': 'MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2014-12-02', 'type': 'review'}

We'd just flown into town and were looking forward to an easy gastropub dinner. The place was not at all what we expected. It was less gastropub than full-on upscale sit-down restaurant, with entrees creeping into the $30 range. Thankfully, we ended up loving the place.\n\nCitizen Public House is in cozy Old Town Scottsdale, and it was vibrant and charming on a Friday night. We had a late reservation (9:15) and the place was still pretty busy. I liked the atmosphere--it was nice, but informal. We hadn't seen Stef in four years, and had a great time catching up over dinner. Service was excellent. Our waiter Brad was on top of his game.\n\nWe had a couple rounds of drinks, and I really enjoyed the cocktails. The Im-Port was particularly good, a smokey drink made with Jameson, Tawny Port, tobacco bitters, and Guinness foam, served on the rocks with a smoked sugar rim. The Thai Margarita was pleasant, too, a mix of Patron silver with galangal and kaffir lime simple syrup, tamarind reduction, Thai chili sea salt, basil, and lime, served on the rocks. It tasted more like a straight margarita than I thought it would, but I liked it. I also had a sample of the barrel-aged Craftsman, made with Jameson, Cocchi Americano, and Charbay green tea apertif. (Brad brought it over because I was waffling between the Im-Port and the Craftsman, and he gave me a free taste after I'd already decided on the Im-Port.) It was pretty great, smooth and boozy with a definite sweetness. Probably would've gotten it if I wanted a third drink. Matt tried one of the other barrel-aged cocktails, the Boulvardier [sic?] made with Maker's 46 bourbon, Campari, and sweet vermouth. Another solid drink.\n\nThe food was fantastic. The three of us shared the pork belly pastrami and an order of Bernie's mac 'n cheese, which worked as both appetizer and side. The pork belly pastrami seems to be Citizen Public House's signature dish, and it's a great one. Pork belly came pastrami-cured and spiced, with rye spaetzle, brussels sprout sauerkraut, and mustard jus. The pork was juicy, fatty, and intensely flavorful, and I loved all of the sides. It wouldn't be right to come here without trying this dish. The mac 'n cheese was also delicious, made with curly cavatappi pasta in a gorgonzola and emmental cheese sauce, with a chilled tomato relish on top. The pasta was cooked al dente and I loved the sharp cheeses and the spicy tomato relish. The portion was huge. We split it three ways and still had leftovers.\n\nI had the pan-seared scallops for my entree, while Matt and Stef had the fair trade short ribs. Both were excellent. The scallops were plump and beautifully cooked, served with Hampshire belly bacon, roasted corn grits, wilted snow pea greens, and a cola gastrique. There was so much great flavor and texture on this plate. It was exactly what I wanted. The short ribs were another winner, a giant plate of tender coffee-rubbed ribs with dried cherry BBQ sauce, roasted parsnip puree, and seasonal vegetables.\n\nWe ended up spending more than we meant to at Citizen Public House, but we were on vacation and had a truly lovely meal. I'd recommend this place for a nice dinner out in Scottsdale, to locals and tourists alike.", 'business_id': 'MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2014-12-12', 'type': 'review'}

Now I'm sad this gastropub isn't on the East Coast. I forget the name of our waiter, but he was very friendly and extremely tall. \n\nThe food was delicious. Here's a rundown.\n\nAppetizers:\nThe Original Chopped Salad (corn, couscous, smoked salmon, asiago, pepitas, tomatoes, arugula, currants, buttermilk pesto dressing) - Despite all the raving reviews, I was really skeptical on how good a salad would be. Damn it was good. The textures were party-in-my mouth good. The buttermilk pesto dressing gave it a perfect tang. Do yourself a favor and order this above anything else. https://www.facebook.com/TheOriginalChoppedSalad/\n\nPork Belly Pastrami (rye spaetzle, Brussels sprout sauerkraut, mustard jus) - The pork belly was melt in your mouth, although some off-putting parts were all fat. The brussel sprouts were shaved leaves. I was confused by the rye spaetzle. Couldn't tell if it was meat or not, but overall the flavors of this dish are good.\n\nChia Seared Tuna (Thai purple sticky rice, asparagus puree, fried leek & micro green salad) - This dish was a bit bland overall. Both the puree and tuna had no flavor, but the purple rice provided a good contrast of texture. I love purple rice in general though.\n\nCrispy Chicken Gizzards (pickled lemon, garlic yogurt, shiso)- The gizzards were dry, made a little bit better with the sauce. A little lackluster compared to the other appetizers.\n\nEntrees:\nTender Belly Pork Chop (dried apricot sorghum, shaved cantaloupe and asparagus salad with pink peppercorn vinaigrette) - This is on the pricey end, but definitely get this for entree. We ordered this medium and it turned out very juicy and well marinated. Good pork flavor. The quinoa provide nice contrast of texture and dried apricots provide extra sweetness.\n\nFair Trade Short Rib (coffee rub, dried cherry bbq sauce, roasted parsnip puree & seasonal veg) - I also recommend this for an entree, despite being pricey. So tender and the flavor was delicious. The bed of mashed turnips was a good combo. The tangy sauce is an explosion of flavor when it hits your tongue.\n\nYum Neau Wrap (grilled beef tenderloin, watercress, cucumber, mint, cilantro, yuzu vinaigrette, Thai eggplant & pickled cabbage slaw) - This was so overpoweringly salty. I could not taste anything it was wrapped with. The best part of this dish was the pickled vegetables, but overall I would not recommend ordering this.\n\nDesserts:\nPig in the Orchard (Apple bread pudding, bacon, brown butter ice cream) - This was recommended by our waiter as his favorite. Good recommendation by him, because this made dessert my favorite part of the night. The bread was so soft. Not sure I could taste the bacon This is a must get dessert\n\nCocoa Jar (chocolate coffee pudding, crispy rice crumble, whipped cream, cocoa cookies)- Not a big fan of cream, but everyone else in my family loved it. liked the cookie crumble on top and the cocoa cookies. There is a cookie/brownie at the bottom of the jar. Make sure you dig into the layers to get every layer in a bite to bring it all together.\n\nDim Lighting, fantastic food. Extremely popular so make a reservation if you can. I will definitely miss that Chopped Salad very much.", 'business_id': 'MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2014-12-30', 'type': 'review'}

Our first move was to order drinks - my wife's sangria was particularly refreshing.   Our first bite was the optional bread service, served with a notably good olive oil. For starters we had the much acclaimed chopped salad. I typically don't address salads much in my reviews, but this salad was one of the highlights of the meal and our trip - it was awesome for a couple reasons. First, the flavors were great.  I didn't catch all the components, but the freeze-dried corn added crunch, and the protein came from smoked salmon. Second, the theater of the salad presentation and preparation was awesome. The server presented the salad with its ingredients nearly arranged in rows, and he added the awesome buttermilk dressing and tossed it at the table. The results were amazing. Our second starter was the Chia Seared Tuna, with purple sticky rice, asparagus pur\xe9e, fried leaks and greens. The colors and presentation were great but the flavors were more muted. We liked it and it was fine but it was far overshadowed by the salad. \n\nFor entrees my wife had the scallops and I had the filet. The scallops were exceptional - perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned on a puddle of creamy and buttery grits. Loved them. The filet was fine but not really exceptional. I liked it a lot and the preparation was fine but it wasn't really all that memorable. I did like it though. I really wanted the scallops but decided not to order the same entree as my wife. \n\nFor dessert we had the brownie sundae, which was good but not exceptional. The brown butter ice cream was a little icy - not offensively so, but it didn't taste like it was made same-day. The brownies were ok too.\n\nThe bartender was particularly attentive (in a good way). My brother-in-law (to be) was interested in trying a couple varieties of Scotch and the bartender came to our table and delighted in detailing his thoughts and letting him taste several options. \n\nOne more comment on Citizen Public House is that it could really be anywhere - from the menu you wouldn't know you were in the Southwest - I didn't see even a single solitary chili pepper on the menu. \n\nRecap: chopped salad, scallops and service were all high points.

The first time I went there I had their meatloaf, which some people either hear as "Ew" or some go "I only eat my mom\'s".  I do not want to knock any mother\'s out there, but this meatloaf was absolutely phenomenal!  Our server, Gary, recommended it to us and I\'ve never viewed meatloaf the same.  My boy, Gary and my boy Sam are both super legit and just awesome servers, you should ask to sit in their sections.

I was staring at a hotel near this place and the reviews couldn't be better, but what really made me decide was the pictures showing a very unique kitchen.\nAs I arrived the place was packed but traveling by myself has its advantages I was able to find a place at the bar.\nThis guys are friendly and even though the bar was full, the service was excellent.\nStarted with a glass of wine and the crab cakes. They arrive within 5 minutes oil ordered them. Taste was fresh and not fishy at all, loved how well they go with the salad and sauce they came on top of. They tastes very good but I am sure there has to be another appetizer in the menu that would actually blow my mind. Not a bad start at all\n\nTo follow the trout: presentation was a 10, cooked to perfection with skin as it should. The flavor as good and perfect it was, also it was also missing something, I was set up to be impressed but I was stopped just just short of it. \n\nAs good as the appetizer and the entree were I would not repeat these dishes as it is my believe there has to be a mind blowing dish... Maybe the scallops ? \n\nTo finish the bread pudding... It actually has bacon on it!! STOP THE PRESS!!! I've found it!! One out of three. This is just fantastic and mind blowing. apple and bacon bread pudding with brown butter ice cream is TO DIE FOR!\n\nThis gives solid grounds to my theory that there has to be other mind blowing items in the menu I have not tried.\n\nThis is a very solid 4 star restaurant, I just need my mind blown 3 out 3 but being so close to do so I will definitely give this restaurant a try", 'business_id': 'MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2015-02-05', 'type': 'review'}

JB loved the tuna! My second was the scallops, and it was up there as one of the best plates I have had. JB had the filet and it was good, but not amazing.  I noticed it had that same sauce as the meatloaf from when I was first here. I just don't think the taste is fitting to the dish.  Then dessert, the caramel sauce made the red velvet perfect and the flourless chocolate cake was so great! I think the texture made it the best!! Beyond rich! Soooo good!

The chopped salad was spectacular. The lamb burger was amazing - flavor bursted in my mouth with each bite. \n\nThere are no words to describe how good this restaurant is.

We were in the area after some shopping at the mall close by and decided to check out this restaurant after doing some research on Yelp. We arrived around 8:15pm and requested a table for 3. The asian hostess, Stacey, snubbed us and told us that there was a 2 hour wait. We did not really have a problem with that since it was a Saturday night and the restaurant appeared busy. However, I decided to hop on Open Table to see if there were any reservations available. Low and behold, there was an 8:45, 9:00, 9:15... reservation for 3 available. We decided to reserve the 8:45pm reservation and hang out til our time was up....\n\nWe returned to the restaurant at 8:45pm and let the hostess know that we had a reservation. Again, SNUBBED BY STACEY and surprise, there was a table available for us! We were shocked at how she did not seem to care that she told us that there was a 2 hour wait when we were able to reserve a table for 30 minutes later...\n\nBeyond the horrible waitress, I would rate this restaurant 4 stars.  Our waiter AJ was amazing. He should get 5+ stars He was friendly, had great recommendations and was very attentive to our needs. Everyone that served us was friendly and super attentive!\n\nThe food was 4 stars. We enjoyed the following items:\n- The Bacon Fat Heirloom Popcorn -- This was probably the most disappointing dish we had. There were hints of bacon fat but it needed some kind of kick like an herb to make it pop?\n- The Original Chopped Salad -- Apparently it has it\'s own Facebook page. It\'s definitely worth the hype! It\'s similar to a tea salad at a burmese restaurant in the way it is presented.\n- Buttermilk Chicken -- The chicken was juicy throughout.\n- Pork Osso Buco -- Fall off the bone good.\n- Pan Seared Scallops -- Recommended by our waiter and was delicious! \n\nOverall, I would\'ve rated this place 4 stars had it not been for our horrible hostess situation... so it\'s gets bumped down to 3 stars. To add insult to injury, I also want to add that I just received an email from Open Table stating that I "No Showed" for our reservation.

Boy, were we wrong! It was so worth it!  The pork belly pastrami was TO DIE FOR (ignore the fact that your cholesterol may shoot 50 points)! Hehe ;) The scallops were cooked perfectly and seasoned just right.  \n\nOur server was very knowledgable about the menu offerings and even suggested a few areas around town that we might like to visit after our dinner.  He was super friendly and checked on us frequently throughout the night.  \n\nIf I ever make a trip to Scottsdale again, I\'ll definitely be stopping by here again :)', 'business_id': 'MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2015-03-20', 'type': 'review'}

The blueberry sauce they put on it is great, not too sweet and compliments the other flavours nicely.\n\nThe ambiance is also very nice, with lots of light and fresh air coming in, crisp white tables clothes while still giving the allusion of being somewhat casual. \n\nThe cocktails were okay as well, the ones that we tried from the menu didn't amaze me.

They put dried corn in the salad and it tastes like crouton but sweet, and the smoked salmon for protein, the flavors are amazing. The pork belly pastrami was good, but nothing special. It tastes just like any other pork belly dish but it was still cooked perfectly.

I think Scottsdale has better tasting food than San Diego! I saw Citizen on yelp and had my eye on it but was a bit tainted because my friend and I have bad experiences with "gastropubs" or at least the ones in Cali. It always turned out to be horrible tasting food that tries tooooo cool and overpriced... we took the leap of faith and said fck it lets do it, maybe Scottsdale gastropubs will be different, and indeed it was!\n\nWe couldn\'t get reservations (place is packed for a good reason) but the hostess said there were bar seats available, and we were cool with that. We just wanted food in and out. Also it was fight night, all the other bars were charging $20 each, why not spend that money on good food instead? \n\nI couldn\'t believe how good the food tasted here. I was in shocked because... well it\'s Scottsdale, wasn\'t sure if this was a foodie mecca. Citizen (and amongst other places) proved me wrong. We decided not to stuff our faces and instead get 2 apps and 1 entrees. \n-Chia Seared Tuna: the best seared tuna and most creative seared tuna I\'ve tried thus far...and I eat out a lot (1130+ reviews). The chia seeds were unique and gave it an amazing crunch! Put that with the asparagus puree, black-like rice and a spicy puree...it was a burst of flavors in your mouth. We licked the plate clean.\n-Crabcakes: For a landlock town, they sure weren\'t stingy on the crab meat! Every bit had crab and the breading was at a minimal so you actually tasted the crab!The aioli was also good on it but it was flavorful itself you probably didn\'t need it!\n-Pork Osso Buco: We usually have lamb, but pork is also a good alternative. The pork by itself is dry, but if you actually mix all the flavors it was not at all dry and had sooo many flavors. The polenta that tasted like butter and cheese with the roasted tomatoes and kale... it literally made my mouth melt and fall in love with this dish. The kale was cooked perfect! I can eat this everyday. \n\nEverything we had that night was excellent. This place sure was not the hype. Service was great, good was great, company was great... I think this is as good as it gets in Scottsdale for dinner... put this in SD and it\'ll be the new "it" restaurant. *Hint Hint* Come on over', 'business_id': 'MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2015-05-07', 'type': 'review'}

And definitely had reservations, previously had tried to go to Citizen in April and it was slammed.  \n\nI loved the multiple course menu idea and to be honest I think they should do it often for certain weekends as nothing beats that. We both had the Chopped Salad, which to be honest...was amazing.  Great idea, and it sports it's own Facebook page. We also shared the drink pairing, the first one which was vodka based made sense but we really weren't that interested in it.  For the second course she had the Buttermilk chicken and I the pan seared scallops.  Both were amazing, the grits were very fine and I hate grits.  The grits were quite tasteful.  The second drink was a citrus and gin cocktail, definitely see how it went with the scallops or the chicken, it was good but no idea how it would couple with the meatloaf.\n\nFor our desert I chose the Peanut Butter Strata Bar and she the Pig In the Orchard, the peanut butter strata bar tasted as though I could ascend to heaven.  The bread pudding was ok, but the maple ice cream that came with it was decadent.  The cocktail was patron cafe based and it completely went with either deserts.  \n\nI would say the skills of the bar tender and the chef were in full display, the only thing that could have made this a five star night would have been our waiter being way more attentive.  He gets a pass as it seemed they needed more wait staff, so given how many patrons he had he did good work.", 'business_id': 'MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2015-05-29', 'type': 'review'}

It was moist, and perfectly seasoned, and also - a very filling portion, enough to share. \n\nAnd the desserts..  Were a perfect ending. We tried both the peanut butter jelly type concoction and the peanut butter chocolate dish. They were both really tasty. Not too sweet or overpowering, really pleasant to eat.\n\nFinally, the citi-zen cocktail is delicious.

When I fist walked in, I was greeted immediately and Matt (with the pretty blue eyes) escorted us to a nice booth for just the two of us and wished me a happy birthday (we were there to celebrate my birthday). \n\nWe ordered the Bacon Fat Heirloom Popcorn to start. It was freshly popped popcorn with actual bacon pieces on top. Yum. Then we shared the Original Chopped Salad. I crave these things so it was all that I'd dreamed of. My hubby ordered the lam burger for dinner (he said it was really good, but wished he had ordered it well instead of medium well) and I got the Truffled Grilled Cheese Sandwich, which had mashed potato on it (holla!) you could also add chicken or bacon, but I opted for it just the way it was. It was so good!\n\nFor cocktails, my hubby had the Beast (tequila cocktail - strong, but with a kick) and I had the Manhattan (strong, but tasty) and the Julep (strong, but sweeter than the Manhattan). They definitely don't skimp on the alcohol and know how to make a good cocktail. \n\nOur server brought out the dessert menu and suggested the bread pudding or the peanut butter bar. We decided to go with the peanut butter bar (chocolate, peanut butter, strawberry jam, white chocolate ice cream). When it came out with no candle, the hubs asked where it was. The server hadn't been told it was my birthday! Pretty blue-eyed Matt had dropped the ball! (Bad Matt, bad). She felt really bad and brought out a candle, which was really very sweet. We then received a visit from the General Manager, Steve. He also felt really bad because they feel a birthday is special and if one chooses to spend it there, then it is a big deal to them. Because of all that, they comped the dessert (birthday dessert is apparently super tiny) and our popcorn AND gave us a $50 gift card to come back and let them make it up to us! \n\nI think they went above and beyond the realm of good customer service and am looking forward to going back.

This is by far one of my top scallop dishes ever tasted.\n\nBut for this evening, we (the fiancee) got there early and took advantage of the happy hour.  The rosemary salted nuts where good and flavor was great.  Order the fondue which came with a nice side of break and some jerky.  Cheese was great and didn\'t become to hot like some places that have to much heat underneath the cheese.\n\nFinal appetizer was the pork belly pastrami.  Again, nailed it with layers of flavor, even from the slight hint of mustard at the end.  Not to mention a very tender pork belly.  Next the chopped salad which I\'ve had at least 5 times.  Won\'t go into detail but the ingredients are so different they have their own Facebook page! \n\nEntrees for me was the Fair Trade Short Ribs and my significant other just had the macaroni and cheese side.  Short Ribs where good, maybe 30 seconds less on the cooking for me- which is a personal preference.  I\'m not a fan of parsnip puree, but the texture and flavor was great.  My significant other\'s mac and cheese was huge.  Lots of cheese flavor and lots of noodles.  For me it needed a "pop" of something but I can\'t place it.  \n\nLast, but not least, they do know how to serve a decent cocktail.  I\'ve complained before how restaurants want to charge but not deliver, but CPH gives a real drink with real flavors.  Try their Manhattan if you like whiskey and you\'ll be sure to love house made bitters with the orange and cherry twist.  My fiancee had the Mia Margarita which had some nice hints of lemon and lime with a surprise salt rim that had a smokey taste.', 'business_id': 'MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2015-07-12', 'type': 'review'}

We made it for their happy hour which I had heard was outstanding.  \n\nOur first impression was that the restaurant was very swanky.  We felt underdressed when we first walked in, we had just come from the Scottsdale mall on a Sunday and were dressed more for comfort in the Phoenix summer heat.  We were seated immediately.  \n\nI wanted to take advantage of the barrel-aged cocktails that were on happy hour (for a very good price).  I could not decide, so our server brought a sample of two of them which helped me decide.  I ended up getting the Instant Gratification which is a semi-sweet drink made of scotch, cognac, and grand marnier I think.  We ordered the Kiltlifter fondue next which neither of us were crazy about.  I'm not sure if it was the cheese or the beer, but something made it bitter.\n\nFor our entrees I got the meatloaf and she got the cubano.  We were both very pleased with our meals, however she did not like the meatloaf saying it was too dry and not very flavorful.  \n\nAll in all it was a decent place with good cocktails and average food.  We were disappointed mainly because we had such high hopes from all of the reviews.

The salad I've had numerous times and there are dozens of reviews about it so I'll focus on the Ahi. \n\nIt arrived shortly after my salad bowl was cleared. It was presented with micro greens, fried leeks and an asparagus gastric. The Ahi was seated nicely and was a good portion. Pretty good but not great. I was pining for the fondues that surrounded me. \n\nSam was genuinely happy to greet all his guests and made me feel like an important part of the clientele.

Additional searing, some salt and peppering, etc. It just wasn't up to snuff. It was tender as can be, however if I'm paying $38 for two medallions of meat, I expect to be blown away. I was less than blown away, since it just tasted like... well... meat. No complexity of flavor or aroma. It could appeal to people, but not me.

We wanted a safe bet for good food, we are big fans of the Gladly, and were willing to pay a larger bill. Sadly we only achieved the later. I am hoping this was an off night as all the other reviews were rather strong.\n\nFirst we were presented with the Summer menu, which being October should have been the Fall menu.\n\nWe had the tuna and peaches on the appetizer list. The tuna was really good 8/10 - slight fishy taste, but hey its Arizona. The sea is far away. The baked peach salad was pretty bad though. The lettuce and bacon was ok, but the peaches were hard as rocks. Its a dish we have all done and if you have peaches a little less than ripe you can usually wing it, but these were solid like a rock. They were most likely very apt for the Summer menu, but as it is Fall, peaches are no longer in season.\n\nWe ordered the scallops as our main. I'm a big scalop guy, but these were undercooked and leveled off with a huge pile of greens on top. The photograph of the scallops on yelp showed them with a deep brown sear. Ours were white with a hint of brown and pink in the middle. \n\nI think the best part of the meal was true to scottsdale form, the cocktail. Extra strong which made my girlfriend a little more flirty. \n\nWe decided to cut our losses and go to a different restaurant. Frank and Alberts over at the Biltmore. If you want a really good dinner and ambiance you should check this spot out.\n\nThe meal came to $80, and we were charged an extra $8 for an extra scalop on the plate which we left behind as a casualty of a bad dining experience.\n\nMoral of the story: if you are into the scottsdale drinking scene bring your date here they serve a strong cocktail, if you are into good food look elsewhere.", 'business_id': 'MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2015-10-11', 'type': 'review'}

Citizen Public House came highly recommended, and delivered a tremendously fun dining experience last night.\n\nOn a Wednesday night, Citizen was still pretty busy when we walked in around 8:30.  We were taken care of my Greg, who was one of most enthusiastic servers I've ever encountered, but he was a true service professional who really knew the menu from top to bottom, and talked about the cocktails, food, and dessert options with no difficulty, giving his appraisals as he went.\n\nWe started with the Char Siu pork tacos and Citizen's well-known chopped salad, which was mixed tableside by Greg.  I can see why people love the chopped salad, particularly with respect to its presentation, but the Char Siu tacos, while good, were less memorable.\n\nFor entrees we tried the evening special, a Bavette steak, the short ribs, and the venison loin.  The highlight for me was the venison loin, which was presented rare, exactly as ordered.  Nice cold center but well seared on the outside.  The bavette steaks were not quite as successful.  Based on preferences at the table, one was ordered super rare (blue) the other was ordered medium rare.  However, both came out pretty similarly cooked (I'd call it rare), and in fact the one ordered medium rare seemed to be the one less cooked despite the fact that it came out a few minutes later.   We enjoyed the steaks nonetheless.  Finally, the braised short rib was well executed with a coffee rub, again not particularly memorable but still a dish we enjoyed.\n\nI really enjoyed the cocktails and in particular their barrel aged options.  The Instant Gratification was a scotch-based cocktail with Cognac and Amaro, and it's pure alcohol.  Definitely a slow sipping cocktail.  I also enjoyed tasting the Manhattan, which was well-made.  Their wine list is reasonably extensive and has options in all price ranges. We enjoyed the 2013 Chappelet Mountain Cuvee for $45.\n\nOverall, this was a tremendously fun restaurant that was enhanced by our excellent server, Greg.

Our waiter was quick and when the kitchen was backed up due to a party of 30, he let us know they were running a little behind. \nFour stars because they ditched my favorite drink but I will be back!', 'business_id': 'MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2015-12-19', 'type': 'review'}

We were a party of 11. I started with the aged barrel scotch drink. This was tremendous. They delivered an olive tapenade bread with butter after the drinks were delivered. This was good. I had the short rib and mashed potatoes. The short ribs, kale and sauce was amazing however the mashed potatoes was way too syrupy and thin. I think they added this sweet sauce to the mashed potatoes. Someone ordered the mashed potatoes as a side and it was very good not like the side on my plate. The rack of lamb came almost raw and wasn't sent back because she was too shy. The beans under the lamb were hard.  She did try to tell the waiter she didn't like them and he promptly brought the exact same beans to the table. She sent those back and got the mashed potatoes. The grapefruit salad was amazing. The meatloaf was truly amazing. Best ever anywhere! Mac N Cheese was very good not great. The waiter delivered a hard sugar cookie packaged in plastic wrap for the birthday guest. It was what you would expect from Subway yet not as good. The service was very good. There was a waiter in the corner watching our table at all times. All we had to do was look up. Very cool. On the whole the experience was very good not great.", 'business_id': 'MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2015-12-20', 'type': 'review'}

I highly recommend the famous Chop Salad and mac and cheese. They have a great drink selection and romantic environment.  I would highly recommend this place for your next date night or night our with the gang. Also in walking distance to the Old Town bars which make this a great spot to hit before a night out on the town.', 'business_id': 'MuIXnv7Oq7X3-4aEsp9dDA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2015-12-21', 'type': 'review'}
