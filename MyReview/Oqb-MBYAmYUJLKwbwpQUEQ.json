The characteristic of scallops is that they are really juicy, so if you let them sit there for too long, the juices from the scallops will start to leak out and they start to become soggy. That\'s the nature of the scallops, nothing to do with the restaurant.\n\nDecor was very cute! And the staff is so nice.

The cod was tender and flakey and the breading crispy and light. Not greasy at all. The combo came with 2 shrimp, which didn't even look like shrimp when they came out because they were long and thin. But, I guess they butterfly them or something to give them that shape.

The fish and chips there were awesome, but oh so covered in fried batter.  My coworker, having not really had much fried food in his diet as of late, got a mean talking to by his stomach.  I, on the other hand, suffered from a bout of the itis.  Mmm fried food.\n\nSo here I am on a Saturday afternoon wondering what to put in my belly.  I was driving down South Rainbow, planning on getting something quick at Fausto\'s, when I saw Lazy Joe\'s Fish & Chips nearby.  Now the only other fish and chips that I enjoy here in Vegas is at the Crown and Anchor; mostly for the fish.  The fries there are just okay.  I decide to skip Fausto\'s and head into Lazy Joe\'s to get my second helping of fish and chips this week; and I\'m glad I did.\n\nI got myself the two piece cod meal, which came with seasoned fries, cole slaw, and two hush puppies.  The other two fish choices were catfish and hughglej...yeah, I don\'t remember.  I *think* it started with an H though.  The thing that surprised me was how the fish turned out.  It was delicious, but also didn\'t have that "fresh out of the fryer" layer of oil on the outside that seems to be typical.  All food is cooked to order, which is obvious when you try to take that first bite of fish (and then proceed to do the rapid "inhale-exhale" with the food still in your mouth, instead of, you know, taking the food out).  The batter on the fish did not overpower the fish, it complemented it in that you didn\'t feel like you were eating batter with a little fish filling.  The fish fillets were a good size, with me feeling very satisfied at the end of the meal.  The seasoned fries were great as well.  See Michael W.\'s review for a more in depth look at the fries.\n\nAll in all it was a very satisfying meal.  With a bottle of water it cost me $10 and change for my meal.  After finishing my meal I noticed that they had a sign with a special for all you can eat fish and chips for $10.95 or so; better deal?  Yes, but I was already stuffed after two pieces of fish.

When we walked in, first thing I notice - no heat lamps and no pre-breaded fish sitting around. They make their stuff to order which is awesome. The bag of their special batter (a gluten free recipe) can be purchased here. The owner was quite nice and advised us to get a small drink (which is still a gigantic 20oz cup) as there are free refills in the restaurant.\n\nThe various fried items (fish and zucchini) were nicely breaded with their special coating and remained moist inside. The coating was substantial and more in the style of a cornmeal-type breading rather than a lighter beer batter. The great thing was it was not greasy but yes, as a previous reviewer noted the batter did have some trouble holding together.\n\nOn the downside was their sides and sauces. The tartar sauce was too heavy on the mayo - not enough acidity to balance out the flavour. The coleslaw was kind of bland, nothing special. The fries were homestyled fries which typically lack that lovely crispiness and are prone to become soggy quickly. The hush puppies were ok.\n\nFinally a quick note or word of warning. This place doesn't really season (salt/pepper) their fried items for you. Personally, I have no problem with that 'cause that's how they roll in some of the fry shops in the UK that I've been to. It's kind of expected that you load your stuff with packets of salt/pepper yourself.\n\nOverall, I think this place is good but nothing I feel an urgent need to return for.

I know, it's gluten-free, and i'm glad this is out there for people with gluten allergies. But, I prefer a beer-battered fish. The quality of the fish was good, I got a single piece of cod, and 2 shrimps. The flesh was sweet and tasty, no fishiness. YAY! The batter is just not up my alley, it's dense and heavy. The hushpuppies were -excellent- and I really liked those! They seemed handmade, with flecks of onion and parsely. The fries were SO dissappointing! The color -looked- good on them, but they were soggy, limp and greasy. I got the seasoned fries, and I liked the flavor of the seasoning, I just could not eat much, due to the limpness.\n\nThe owners of the business really TRY hard, tho. They are both friendly people, and seem to care about some things, but leave other aspects hanging. It's a small place, with perhaps seating for 30 people. There are menus on the table, and it seemed like it was a sit-down, waiter service type of place. But, if you took a seat, you'd find people cutting in front of you, and they don't bother to put signage up, to let people know to order FIRST, then take a seat. Clarification on this would be nice, but I'm sure the regulars knows the drill by now.\n\nI'm glad I tried Lazy Joe's, but I won't be back.

I purchased a Groupon for this place in high hopes. My boyfriend and I love Fish & Chips and since we live close to Crown & Anchor, we would usually go there. To change up the scenery a little bit, we popped into this little joint. I live close to UNLV so this place wasn't an easy find for me. I got the number and asked for cross streets. The lady on the phone sounded super southern (she literally said, ''we are a hop, skip, and a jump away from New Day Cafe, whatever the hell that is) and extremely annoyed. That wasn't a good first impression. We finally found it, and not with her help. We went inside, sat down and were greeted after being there for a little bit. The waiter told us about a special they were having and I told him I had a Groupon, he sounded excited and said, ''I LOVE IT'' and brought over the ''specials'' menu. We ordered 2 Haddock filets each with fries and a coke. For an appetizer we ordered the ''Flowering Onion''. I redeemed the Groupon and went back to my seat. After a couple of minutes she came back over with a receipt and told me I had to pay for the meal because the Groupon doesn't work for the specials, so I asked if we could just pay the difference since the Groupon was worth $20. She said no. I told her that I had already redeemed it. She stared at me with judging, watchful, eyes and then said, ''FINE''. She gave me a receipt for a different total. Which wasn't much less than the other total and I just payed it because we were already there. We got our food, the hush puppies were incredible but everything else was mediocre. The worst was the over-seasoned & uneatable ''flowering onion''. It was the saltiest thing I had ever eaten. The filets were average, they tasted a little better with vinegar. The fries were overcooked and over-seasoned as well. I didn't even bother with the cole slaw. I'd say all in all, the coke and the hush puppies were great. I will just go ahead and stick to Crown & Anchor, they have the best fish & chips in town and their beer choices are the perfect pair to this meal.

So alas, I gave this place a shot especially since it was near my house. After all, what did I have to lose? \n\nFirst Impression: Hmm maybe we should re-think this! We walked in and the place was dead but the owner was a great fella along with the rest of his staff so we decided to stay. \n\nMy fellow foodie and I ordered our dishes- 2 cod & onion rings and 2 chicken/2 cod with seasoned fries. Let me tell ya, those fries are so worth it. If you like the cajun fries at 5 Guys, these are better! Nice and crispy and great portion size. \n\nAt first glimpse of my plate, i'm thinking hmm $10.99 is far to expensive for 2 itty bitty little pieces of fish and 2 small but fat pieces of chicken. Well once I started eating I soon learned that the combo was bigger than I thought. All them carbs quickly filled my stomach. Lo and behold, there was a huge cod filet buried under my fries! \n\nThe interesting thing is that they use a gluten-free batter, which has it's pros and cons. One pro being that the fish wasn't as soggy and greasy as you find in other places. The con being that there was hardly any flavor and I hate to use the tartar sauce & malt vingear for every bite just to give it flavor. \n\nMy partner enjoyed her over cooked onion rings, which the staff was more than happy to remake but she declined. Had they been cooked slightly less, these onion rings would have phenomenal! They were seasoned perfectly just a tad bit over cooked for me.\n\nThe chicken strips were thick and juicy, and the cod fish could have been great but alas the gluten free batter killed the taste.

For some, cross contamination is not a large concern and fried food, in all its glory, can be experienced with a minimal price to pay later that day/night. For people like myself, too much cross contamination is out of the question and fried food is something of the past unless you make it fresh at home. Of course, I felt this way until I read about Lazy Joe's and it was all trouble from there.\n\nFirst off, do not come to Lazy Joe's thinking that you are going to get that rustic ale flavor from their fish and chips. The breading is gluten-free, so it is going to taste a little different than the pub down the street (see Crown and Anchor in Vegas!). However, that doesn't mean it isn't delicious! The breading is still a little flaky and not too heavy so that it weighs down the flavor in the seafood. Even though the breading lacks seasoning at times (I wouldn't mind them adding some salt, pepper, granulated garlic, herbs, etc to give it a little more character), when it encases something like a flowered onion or a big stick of mozzarella cheese, very few negative things can be said about this experience. I added some seasoning and BAM! Dunk those fat cheese sticks into their great marinara sauce and you have an appetizer. There is nothing but pleasure while eating their version of Chili's Awesome Blossom. My waistline may hurt a little after eating these app's, but hey, it can't hurt once in a while!\n\nOnto our entree's: Calamari and Popcorn Shrimp. Oh deliciousness. Like I said, the breading needs a little more character but wow do they know how to cook this food perfectly. The shrimp were nicely sized and tender while helped by the added crunch of the breading. The portion size was quite large and if we had stopped eating when we should have, there would still be some pieces left the next day. The calamari was perfect. Served with a marinara sauce, I almost forgot about the simple breading and the fact I had to add a little extra seasoning and some lemon to make it just right. I love that they give you the rings and actual calamari itself when they serve you. FANTASTIC.\n\nNow, onto the fries. If you like crisp, somewhat over cooked french fries than this is not your place. If you are okay with slightly limp fries but with fantastic seasoning, this is the place to go. I normally like my fries crispy, but when they put their seasoned fry seasoning on these potatoes I forgave the lack of crunch and dove in head first into the massive pile of carbohydrates in front of me. To all those who say these fries are terrible, please admit to not liking these type of fries before bashing potatoes that are actually very good and bring the meal full circle. Just a tip: GET THEM SEASONED. Otherwise, they're just predictable and you should try to keep it interesting.\n\nAll in all, this should be a solid 3.5 stars, but because Yelp refuses to apply half stars to their reviews I will push it up to 4 because the service was friendly, the restaurant was clean and well-maintained and hey, any place that makes it safe for me to eat in will beat plenty of other restaurants in my book!\n\nP.S.

I was really excited walking in and I couldn't wait to get elbow deep in a bunch of fried foodz. But le sigh, the entire time I was eating I was somewhat disappointed... For the price I paid, I feel like I've eaten better elsewhere.\n\nORDER: I ordered the Super Combo. Since it was my first time, I wanted to sample what this place had to offer. This order came with 1 fish, 2 shrimp, 2 oysters, 2 scallops, 2 clams, 2 hush puppies, fries and cole slaw. I'm no fish connoisseur, so I went with the haddock because the owner said it was the best; but you can choose whatever fish floats your boat between that, cod, and catfish.\n\nBATTER: Seemed like everything was dipped in a universal batter. It was quite thick and completely unseasoned--heavy spices aren't common for fish & chips. But maybe a little sea salt? I had tartar, cocktail, ranch, and some buttermilk-y sauce which was awesome... but I still felt like my meal was missing something!\n\nSEAFOOD: The fish was cooked perfectly: most & flaky. The shrimp were cut kinda funny--couldn't even tell they were shrimps until I bit into it--a little tough if you ask me! The clams and oysters had to be my favorite part. I love that clean ocean-y taste; the seafood they use here is pretty good quality! \n\nSIDES: I upgraded to sweet potato fries for an extra $1. Totally worth it. What's not to love about the holy fried sweet potato?? Crisp on the outside, soft and sweet on the inside. I'm crazy about fried mushrooms so I went with an order of that for another $3.69. I'm not a fan. The mushrooms here are bland and quite rubbery. Not ordering those again.\n\nSERVICE: Excellent! The owner was working the register and preparing the food. She was so sweet and gave me some recommendations on what to eat. Everything is made fresh. It serves up pretty quick--within 10 minutes or so.\n\nOPTIONS: If your dining partner doesn't like seafood, they do offer other options like chicken fingers and chicken wings. They also have sandwiches like the lobster roll and soft shell crab sandwich which I really want to try. \n\nI was half satisfied with my meal. I think if I come here again, I need to order something a little different. I require heavily seasoned foods and that's probably the reason why this place isn't on my hitlist.

It's such a small place, but it's SO clean and the decor is just too cute to not admire. I also commend them for having such an open kitchen where guests can see you cook. I find that people who are confident with their execution of the food, and their cleanliness by letting guests see them cook is respectable and trustworthy. The service is so wonderful. I see them walk around and have conversations with guests on a personal level (I mean in a hospitable manner). It was so nice of the guy to stop me halfway through buying a bottle of lemonade by warning me that the lemonade was completely organic with no additives so its extra sour. I'm all for lemonade, but that extra sour to it makes me feel like I might as well just drink a full glass of lemon juice (YIKES!). Good looking out my friend! So I just got the mango lemonade instead...phew.\n\nGreat food. Great people. Cute little place.

All the food is gluten free and the oil that they use to fry the food - makes the food super light, and not oily at all. I normally eat the blooming onion at Outback Steak House, but upon trying Lay Joe's flowering onion, I realized that Outback's Blooming onion sucks! The seasoning fries that came with my all-you-can-eat fried shrimp was amazing! Super tasty. The fried shrimp was really good and fresh. Our table also ordered the fried clams, and the all-you can-eat fried fish, and Lazy Joe's himself allowed for us to share and try each item. The tartar sauce used for the fish is amazing, but if you're like me and prefer malt vinegar, they have that avaiable too. When ordering the all-can-eat fish, there were three choices. Haddick, Cod, or Catfish. Order the haddick - the taste of the haddock is the best. Not too dry or flaky. The catfish is super juicy but can be a little bland. \n\nThe service was wonderful!

Big mistake. I ordered the Admiral\'s combo which includes 3 of your seafood choice, fries, and hush puppies. I had the Cod, the shrimp, and the clams. As soon as I get home I dig in, the first piece I had was a clam strip, and it was NASTY; Mushy, undercooked, and extremely fishy tasting. I move on to the shrimp, which was possibly the best cooked out of everything, and the taste was just ok. Finally, the cod, again, slightly undercooked, still gray in color, not flaky, and the batter completely peeled off as soon as I touched it. The fries were, once again, under cooked and soggy. The hush puppies were tasty, but tiny. Worst part about the whole thing is that after an hour of consuming this meal I started getting cold sweats, stomach aches, and a headache. I hadn\'t had anything else before or after the lunch, so there\'s no doubt in my mind that the fish (or the poor preparation of it) from this place caused it.

Anytime I\'m running errands in the Southwest I try to put Lazy Joe\'s on my food-radar. First off, there IS a Lazy Joe. But he\'s the least lazy Lazy person I know. He not only takes orders and does some of the cooking, he\'s floating around from table to table talking to his patrons, and not just talking at them at a shallow level... he genuinely wants to know about them, what their background is, what they do... he\'s looking for a way to connect with them, and often times he finds it, winding into stories of yesterday and how he came up in the business. He\'s very interesting and treats every customer like a member of his extended family.\n\nThe food is a pescaphile\'s dream! (If you don\'t know what "pescaphile" means, you may not be one.) The menu includes clams, scallops (delish!) and many non-fish items such as burgers and chicken, which contrary to what Jessica Simpson believes, is not "of the sea" and in no way references tuna. However, if you go to Lazy Joe\'s Fish and Chips and do not get fish, please check in to your nearest insane asylum, cuz you\'re a bit off and need professional help.\n\nThe past few times I\'ve went, I\'ve been lucky enough to land on their all-you-can-eat fish fry special, which they run Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. The starting round starts with 2 pieces of either cod, haddock, or catfish, six shrimp, and fries. By the time you hit the bottom of your basket, you\'ll be filled with a sensation of mourning, like, "This delicious fish... these tasty shrimp... they\'re all gone! NOOOOOOOO! What have I done to deserve this pain and misery?" But fear not! Just let Joe and his staff know, and within minutes, the glory of fried fish is back, and this cycle continues until you profusely sweat fish batter.\n\nExaggeration? Not by much... it\'s that good.\n\nIt\'s a tiny bit on the pricey side, but then again, you\'re getting fish in the desert, so it comes with the territory. I wish they would expand closer to me, but for now, anytime I find myself on the southwest side of the 215, I look for excuses to be near Lazy Joe\'s.\n\nStop in and give it a try.

I looked at their menu online and at first was turned off by their prices however I wanted what I wanted. I got 3 of the first mate dinners. All with cod, one with shrimp and the other with scallops the last all cod. For $12.99 you get a choice of 2 out of 5 seafood choices, fries, 2 hush puppies and some coleslaw. I didn't want my scallops deep fried and the owner who was very nice ask me if I would like them Pan Seared and I was very happy and pleased as I accepted his offer.  I also wanted to treat my kid to a fun drink so I got a $1.89 bottle of some locally made root beer. Neither one of us enjoyed the root beer... The carbonation tasted stale and it had a bad aftertaste. So our food is ready and I proceed to drive 3 minutes to my home.  I get home and the food Looks Amazing!  The fries were homemade, a little salty but good. I think if they did the double fry method they wouldnt be so dark and would taste better. The fish quality was superb tender, flaky and juicy and the crust was different but cool. The only quams about the seafood was its total lack of seasoning.  There has to be a little to help enhance the natural flavors. The cole slaw was also.flavorless, mayonaissy cabbage. They need to pick up the flavors in their cole slaw, I think a bit of dill relish and some black pepper and Bam! I didnt care for the tartar sauce, it was sweet and I prefer a more savory tartar sauce, in fact a savory sauce would have complimented the fish better.   My hushpuppies were tiny a little over cooked on the outside and little under cooked on the inside BUT THE TASTE WAS DELICIOUS. I really enjoyed them. Now remember those scallops he was going to pan sear for me, in garlic and butter no less, not SEARED at All! The sear would have been perfect to compliment the texture of the scallops. They were not very seasoned either but tender and not overcooked.  I think if they took a chance and made some better culinary executions, that this place would be packed all the time. At first I was upset at the flavorless fish than I read the reviews and saw it was gluten free. Ah haaa I said however Gluten free doesn't mean taste free. Celtic sea salt is healthy and flavorfull and good for you. I finished half my meal, my kid too and my brother ate the whole thing. The quality of the food is Amazing the execution needs a bit more love. At the end of the meal all I kept saying was how I should have ordered the Lobster Roll. For gluten free I think the quality is great and should be packed with gluten free people. There was only one couple eating there and as we were waiting a man came in to eat.

I also tried the lobster roll.\n\nThis place must live on the novelty of being "gluten free", because that\'s the only reason I can see to eat there.  For those of us who can eat gluten, the batter is anything but flavourful.  I\'d describe it as bland, with a "mealy" texture; and certainly not the nice crispy texture you\'d want if you\'re craving fried seafood.  I understand that those with gluten allergies will love this place on principle, but this is definitely a case where everyone else suffers.  They DO have whole belly clams, so that is a plus.  However, you have to tolerate the gross batter in which they\'re fried.  Talk about taking a good thing and ruining it completely!!\n\nOn the flip side, the lobster roll had way too much seasoning, especially the SALT!!  It was literally like eating a salt lick on a dried out, toasted, New England style hot dog bun.  It had lots of fillers, too.  It was stuffed with lettuce and celery; not something anyone in New England would tolerate in a lobster roll.  Of course, that didn\'t matter, since you couldn\'t even remotely taste the lobster with the entire mixture tasting like it had been prepared on a big block of salt.\n\nWhen the gentleman behind the counter asked how everything tasted, I did bring the saltiness of the lobster salad to his attention.  I asked him if he made his lobster salad for the rolls in big batches, and he said yes.  I advised that he ought to taste it, as the salt levels were extremely unbearable.  He then proceeded to tell me that another customer had commented on the salt level, and that this particular batch they "got in" seemed "saltier than usual."  Thus, it seems that they actually don\'t "make" their lobster salad in big batches, but rather "get it in" in big batches.\n\nHowever, the biggest faux pas wasn\'t the extreme saltiness of the mixture, but rather the complete lack of any effort to "make it right" with me, the customer.  All I got was a gruff, "sorry," and that was that.\n\nI used to live in Boston.  I know what good "East Coast" seafood is supposed to be like.  This is NOT it!!\n\nP.S. I saw three high chairs in the restaurant.  ALL THREE OF THEM HAD BROKEN STRAPS.

Haddock is probably my favorite but I usually mix it up.  It's a personal preference and you really can't go wrong here. \n\nOn Weekends they offer an all you can eat special of fish and shrimp.   I think for most people the first serving - 2 pieces of fish, several shrimp, fries, slaw, and hushpuppies will be more than enough.   I usually don't need seconds on the AYCE and I bring my appetite.  You might save a few bucks just getting the fish and shrimp combo.   \n\nI just wish it was closer to my house.

On a day my family and I are searching for fish & chips, we find Lazy Joe's on Yelp.  The reviews seemed promising.  So, we drive on over there for dinner...and we're excited because it's a Friday and we saw online that Fridays and Saturdays they're having their All-You-Can-Eat fish or shrimp.  My brother gets the AYCE shrimp, I get the AYCE fish and mother gets a fish & scallop combo meal.  Across the board, all our food items are ruined by their batter.  The batter is not light & crisp...it's so eggy and thick that when it was fried, it became hardened and gummy.  However, what's that saying?...Beggers Can't Be Choosers...and we're going to try to at least eat our fill on the AYCE deal.  My brother goes to order another batch of shrimp and gets jumped on by the younger bald-headed fry-cook/owner/warden guy.  This guy asks for specifics...how much did you order, how much times did he already order...blah blah blah.  To sum it all up, their fries are burnt, their toss salad was mediocre, their hush puppies were actually decent and I could easily make a better tartar sauce at home!  The flowering onion was possibly the best item we ordered...it was light and crisp but very flavorful.  My brother had the clam chowder and he said it was mediocre, as well.\n\nTo sum it all up, their food was nothing special and that barking, snappish fry-cook guy ruined our dinner.

I love fried clams.  I have always loved fried clams.  I have enjoyed them for over 40 years.  Trying to find real authentic New England fried clams in Las Vegas is difficult.  This place has the real thing.  The right kind of batter.  Fresh whole clams not strips.   Made Fresh to order.  Tartar sauce without weird ingredients.  It's all there.  I highly recommend this place.\n\nWhen I go I usually order a 4 item platter that costs a little more, but it's large enough to split.  They have Haddock, Clams, Oysters, Shrimp, and Scallops.  Pick 4 and you have a true fisherman's platter.  Be sure to substitute Onion Rings for fries.  Nothing is battered frozen imitations - it's all battered in the store immediately before frying.  \n\nCole slaw is good.  Lobster rolls are not bad.\n\nI went through and read all the other reviews.  I had a couple of things to add.  One is that this place calls itself a Fish N Chips place, but let's be honest.  The phrase Fish N Chips brings to mind the English classic.  Don't go here to get English style Fish N Chips.  The batter is a corn meal batter that is used all over New England not Old England.   It's not a puffy flour based batter.  It's a light thin corn meal batter.  It's also not a southern style fried fish place.  I see the owner saying he can vary the spice to give you different seasonings, but if you don't say anything you will get a mild batter which is what I prefer.  They also don't have Pacific fish species like Halibut.  They have North Atlantic seafood like Haddock and Cod.  I believe they also have catfish.  Needless to say these fish are going to be frozen because unless you live next to the docks, you're not going to find truly fresh fish in most places of the world.  We live in a desert.  The only place that have truly fresh fish in Las Vegas are going to be 5 star restaurants that fly fresh fish in daily and charge $50 a plate.  That's not what this is.  I've eaten New England seafood for over 40 years and this is as close as you will find in Las Vegas and I have looked.", 'business_id': 'Oqb-MBYAmYUJLKwbwpQUEQ', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2015-01-14', 'type': 'review'}

It's a nice little mom and pop shop owned by very friendly people. I came here on a whim and decided to try the fish and shrimp combo platter. You can choose 1-3 fillets, but I chose 1, and you can also choose between catfish, cod, and haddock. I chose catfish. The combo also comes with a few pieces of shrimp, 2 hush puppies, your choice of regular or seasoned fries, and coleslaw. Sauces that comes with are tartar sauce and shrimp cocktail sauce. \n\nI came in at an odd time (3 pm) so the owner (I think) had a lot of time to chat with me. He told me that the food is always made fresh, and he showed me large slabs of meat they cut from, fresh and homemade baklava, etc. All the while, I could hear the sizzling of my fish and shrimp being freshly fried.\n\nMy fish was perfectly fried and cooked. The fish was so soft and flaky, to the point where I even had to take a picture of the insides with my cruddy phone. I've definitely had better seasoned fried fish elsewhere (I'm thinking Cuban), but the quality of the fish and the perfectness in how it was cooked is hard to beat. The fries were standard; they didn't really taste specially seasoned to me (ie. when I think seasoned fries, Five Guys come to mind, and this was more like regular fries). The shrimp was delicious. You could actually see chunks of real shrimp with a thin layer of fried batter. The coleslaw is standard, and the sauces were standard. Now out of everything in my order, I purposely left the hush puppies for last. I'm not a fan of hush puppies. And I figured I was going to eat the stuff I wanted while they were piping hot first,and eat a hush puppy last if I still had room for one. Wow. This was the best hush puppy I've ever had. It was so flavorful. I had to take a picture of the center to demonstrate it's not your typical bland cornmeal mush. It was sooo good here. I've had hush puppies in southern Cali, Denver, Miami, and Texas, and I never once liked them. But this is the first time where I can see why some people are fans. I'm still not big on hush puppies, but for what it's supposed to be, these are the best hush puppies I've had. \n\nI would definitely come back to Lazy Joe's to try other menu items. I'm a fan of their quality of food. For instance it's easy to have overly cooked fried fish. And their service is wonderful. If you're not in the mood for fried food, Lazy Joe's also serves classic Greek food, such as spanikopitas, gyros, baba ghanoush, etc. I've yet to try anything from this side of the menu yet, but I will!", 'business_id': 'Oqb-MBYAmYUJLKwbwpQUEQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2015-01-15', 'type': 'review'}

We went today 10-3-15 and had the coupon from the paper again and was told they no longer honor it. Also they did away with the all you can eat. That's not all, they raised the prices. So as we were leaving we gave the lady a tip as she has always been nice while serving us and told her that we were sorry we would not be seeing her again as we would not be back.

I was hesitant to try it because I really love the original recipe, but Joe convinced me and wow it's even better!!  The original option, which is gluten free, is still available.\n\nThe fries and hush puppies might be my favorite part about eating here.   And the shrimp.

Walking in saw a couple seated with no food on their table with a small child running around. Waited at the counter several minutes with no greeting and had to walk back to the kitchen to rouse somebody who finally came out and then disappeared back in the kitchen for 5 minutes. When he finally came out and we wanted to order he told us the owner is no longer honoring Groupons. Probably our good fortune as the atmosphere is at best fast food dingy.

We tried to use a coupon, to which the woman refused to take because it was not printed. It clearly said "present on your mobile phone" but she was having none of it. From what I am reading, this sounds like a common thing with this place.\n\nI actually came in because of the mediterranean menu they claimed to have, but the woman said it didn\'t work so they stopped serving months ago. Well. Cool. How about taking that sign down and taking that menu off the internet?  I was pretty angry at this point.\n\nApparently this place has a gluten free batter, which explains why it was really bad. Same batter for the fish as the moz sticks. One might think they would share this gluten free batter things with people, but I guess they wait until you\'ve paid up to surprise you with tasteless food.\n\nWe gave it a chance because it was two VERY HUNGRY WOMEN and to be honest, the food was not edible. The service was terrible. And we also saw a lady handling raw fish and then touching her cell phone and touching the fish again without washing her hands. I wish I could insert humor into this review but this place just makes me sad.\n\nSpend your money on another local business.', 'business_id': 'Oqb-MBYAmYUJLKwbwpQUEQ', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2015-10-27', 'type': 'review'}
