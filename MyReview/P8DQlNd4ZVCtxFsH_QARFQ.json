It is located on S. Jones in the same plaza as China Mama and HK Star, and across the street from Wendy's Noodle Cafe and 168 Supermarket.\n\nI saw a sign that a new Chinese BBQ place is coming soon, and while driving past it to smashburger on W.Sahara, I saw the neon open sign lit and the business is finally opened.  I wasn't able to go that night, but I made a point to stop by when I was free to check them out and try their food.\n\nAnd before I get into the review, I just want to tell everyone that this is a CASH ONLY business.  \n\nOkay, the restaurtant itself is pretty small. But very clean, since it is still new.  There is a steam table setup where they keep small hotel pans of various Chinese foods.  I didn't try any of that this time.  But since I been craving Chinese style roast duck, I ordered their Roast Duck On Rice to go ($5.50).  The price is reasonable and you get basically a duck leg chopped up over rice and drizzled with the sauce.  It tasted just like most decent Chinese BBQ places, so I was happy.  But I think the best thing to try is their Noodle Combos (which gives you the option to select their 4 noodle selections: Egg Noodle, Udon Noodle, White Flat Noodle (aka Har Fun) or Ramen Noodle.\n\nYou can also order whole or half Roast Duck, Soy Sauce Chicken or Duck, Pei Pa Duck, Salt Roast Chicken and Supremem Chicken. They also offer Roast Pig in 3 sizes: suckling, medium and large (price range from $168 - $228).\n\nThe owner is Cantonese, but can at least understand Mandarin when I placed my order.  Since it is simple to prepare my order (chop up the already roasted duck and place it on rice and drizzle it with the traditional accompany sauce), my order was done within minutes.\n\nSolid 4 stars for the food and value, plus now there is another alternative to Sam Woo.", 'business_id': 'P8DQlNd4ZVCtxFsH_QARFQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2010-09-17', 'type': 'review'}

It was packed, so I ordered takeout - white rice with bbq pork belly and duck.  Huge amounts of white rice and the meats, and a couple of sticks of gai lan.  Their duck soy sauce was also very tasty without MSG.  Trust me - I am supersensitive to MSG.  $8, and I could only finish half the rice.  It was filling and really good food.  \n\nIt's in the same mall as Cravin' Cajun, just three doors away, so parking is plentiful.  Definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas.", 'business_id': 'P8DQlNd4ZVCtxFsH_QARFQ', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2012-06-02', 'type': 'review'}

If you are rusty on your Chinese, be prepared to point at the numbers of each food item you are interested in partaking. \n\nTexture- nice chewy noodles in their soups, perfectly fried skin cradling the underside of an entire backside of pork belly, the appropriate amount of spring to their wontons and fishballs, they definitely get it right with every bite.\n\nFlavor-  No dish is subtle as each ingredient provides depth of flavor yet avoids becoming overpowering.  The wonton noodle soup is well balanced in terms of it's fish-stock like broth yet a dash of red vinegar or chili oil is permissible if not encouraged.  The meats are well seasoned to be eaten straight up but for added layers of flavor explosion, virtually all are accompanied by their own appropriate dipping sauce.  Even the rice that accompanies the bbq dishes and the hainanese chicken are packed with additional notes of spice and seasoning.   \n\nValue- A friend and I paid 4.99 for a steaming bowl of wonton noodle soup (6.99 to add some generous pieces of duck), 6.99 for a combination barbecue rice plate (seasoned rice, chinese greens, and freshly chopped roasted duck and fried pork belly) and 3 dollars for chinese broccoli coated with oyster sauce.  We had a smorgasbord of street eats before us that left us more than adequately stuffed for less than 15 bucks/person.

This place has one of the most authentic hong kong style cuisines in terms of the noodles. It is one of the secrets of Chinatown area until recently when more and more people are coming. It has been voted 8th in the top 100 Chinese foods list.\nMy family comes here all the time due to its authenticity in terms of taste and cost.\nFirst, the cost for the food is cheap compared to other places and there is a variety of things to try from roasted duck, roasted pork, to noodles, to various toppings to add onto your noodle.\nAnd they are closed one day of the week, I think it was Fridays that was written.\nSecond, the food comes really fast after ordering. This place is always crowded around lunch time and you will have to wait if there are no seats. The place is pretty small compared to many other restaurants in terms of space and seating.\nThird, the food is always flavorful. Though I had a couple times where the topping I wanted "Pork Blood" was sold out. All the toppings are always cooked really well.\nThe main thing to try at this place is the noodles + toppings.\nYou have a choice between the type of noodle you want.\nI usually chose udon due to my taste for a more chewier noodle.\nAnd then you can choose whether you want one, two, or three toppings to add into the soup/noodle.\nThe toppings range from pork blood, pork belly, curry fish balls, fish balls, tofu, and etc.\nAlso, there is a lot of different mixes that they are willing to accommodate if you ask. For instance, you can order a won ton soup and still add in different toppings if you wanted to. \nHowever, if your taste buds are not so interested in the toppings you can add into your noodle, there is always duck and chicken to try. It is always fresh and flavorful. The butcher always cuts the meat really clean so when you get the product, you don\'t have to go trying to pull the pieces apart. In addition, he is very delicate with the food (which also means patience) if you are looking to do take-out. But the duck and chicken are a lot better than other Chinese places I\'ve eaten at. \nVery important: This place is CASH only.', 'business_id': 'P8DQlNd4ZVCtxFsH_QARFQ', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2012-12-20', 'type': 'review'}

Upon further review, I added them back to my plate and was glad I did. \n\nUnfortunately, I didn't agree with previous yelp reviews on the Wonton soup. The broth reminded me of miso soup and seemed to have a fish stock base to it. The Wontons themselves contained shrimp -which I did not expect. Since I am not a huge fan of shrimp, I can't confirm that this is the best version of Wonton soup in Las Vegas (as other have claimed). \n\nThe restaurant is clean, and well organized. There is a large menu on the wall behind the cash register that makes it easy to order. My food was ready in less than 10 minutes, and was still piping hot when I got back to work. I love this place, and can't wait to come back.", 'business_id': 'P8DQlNd4ZVCtxFsH_QARFQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2013-01-29', 'type': 'review'}

My guy server really didn\'t understand me and in turn, I have no idea what he was ranting about.

Our kind gentleman server informed us that the roasted duck was going to be another 20 minutes, my husband wanted that duck,  Bad! So we waited and ordered food to eat in, in the mean time.\n\n We ordered won ton soup with pork belly instead of duck, we also ordered pork ribs. and fish balls. Before the food got there, I realized we didn\'t not have enough cash for my husbands hunger and cravings. My husband orders food like he\'s on death row.  I proceeded to go to BOA , just down the road. (It\'s cash only) OK, so by the time I came back, my husband and my 6 year old daughter decided since they ate all the pork belly that they needed to order another one before I got there. They were raving about how great it was, my husband was in a pig heaven sort of a trance and my daughter was hoarding pork on her side of the table. Seriously, my husband was in awe of the pork belly. I have never seen him so excited and patiently waiting his duck. "Ingrid, please come look at the pork with me??" "No. Andrew, I can see the pork from here." Look at it, look at it, please!!"? "It\'s OK, I can see it, Andrew." That was our bbq banter. He finally gave up and decided to go stare at the glass of hanging meat and drool. If you cant tell, he really loved that pork belly!! And he was right to love it. It had a perfect crispy skin, tasty pork and not overly fatty.  The fish balls with curry sauce were good. We had to get 2 orders because my daughter did not want sauce. We ended taking most of them home. They were good, just not great. The soup was a super large portion and was pretty good, clean tasting and the noodles and won tons were not soggy and pretty perfect. \n\nMy daughter wanted rice so we got a small side of rice and they brought out some kind of duck sauce. I absolutely loved that sauce and the rice was perfectly cooked. By the way, the lady who brought out the rice was so kind and polite. To go we ordered the 3 meat combo for 12.99, I believe.  Since my husband realized it did not come with rice, he ordered a duck and rice combo for 6.99. Needless to say, yes this is a pretty inexpensive place, but the fact that my husband has no self control when it comes to pork, our bill was about 49.00 dollars, 10 dollar tip, but we had so much food, enough for his late night munchies and lunch AND dinner the next day.

They had signs everywhere saying they were #8.   Between the Yelp reviews and the their award for being the #8 Chinese restaurant in the USA, we couldn't be wrong.   \n\nThe owner of the restaurant is a genius for jumping on the pork belly bandwagon.  This is the only place that I have seen that hangs roasted pork belly instead of a whole pig.  Is it the best that I have had?  No.  But, it was good.   We also tried their duck.  Their roast duck was had a good flavor, but, did not have much meat on it.  \n\nTheir noodle soups and lo mein (dry noodles) were good.  The soup was decent.  Their lo mein which comes with a special sauce, and costs $1 more than the soup noodles.  Wontons were good.  The only complaint I have is that they do not give enough noodles.  Even my 8 year old daughter finished a bowl of noodles all by herself.  She normally is a very small eater.  \n\nOverall, this is a pretty good Chinese restaurant.  Yelpers were not wrong with this one.  When I go to Vegas again, I need to come back to this place.  \n\nEdit 4/12/13\n\nAsian BBQ & Noodle is better than the Chinese BBQ and won ton noodle joints in the East San Gabriel Valley.  They beat the Rowland Heights Sam Woo.  Not sure how they compare to the same type of restaurants in Alhambra and Monterey Park.  It might be better than #8.

The meat below it not too shabby either moist, cooked perfect, and combine the crunch with moist meat its yin yang of pork. No joke.

I also ordered the beef fried rice. Talk about nice size portion. It could have used more meat and vegetables but overall solid dish. Really pricing most of the things are under $10 and get decent amount of food. Good food too!!!\n\nTalk about Asian. The atmosphere just like few Pho spots around town tables by numbers, cash only (so make sure got some on you), servers at times hard too understand, talk about authentic asian music, and most of the conversations like okay.

Every time I see it (or think it), I envision how good it must taste and have come close so many times to ordering it.\n\nI know, you\'re wondering "well why on earth didn\'t you?"   The answer is not an easy one.  Some combination of a lack of an official website/menu which can turn me off of a place a little, along with being tied to lunch partners who wouldn\'t have a desire to visit, along with some unknown fear that resided with me in trying it.   Well today I strapped on a "No Fear" t-shirt from 1995 (not really) and called in an order to make my dreams come true.\n\nIt was not easy.  I venture to say it was one of the more difficult phone ordering processes I\'ve ever experienced.  It took a few minutes for me to convey I wanted the Roast Pork and Roast Duck combo over rice and an iced tea to go.  In fact, during the drive there I was certain it wouldn\'t be what I wanted, that my dreams would be crushed over a simple game of telephone.\n\nWhen I showed up the entire restaurant was packed, and it made the telephone conversation difficulty a little more clear to me.  Seeing the "Cash Only" sign only amplified my fear that my order was wrong and that they would try to charge me for a full roast duck and pig and a side of rice, in which I would need to work off by washing dishes in the back for the rest of the afternoon.   To my pleasant surprise, once the cashier had a free second she rang me up and I was charged $6.99 (before tax) just as the photo told me.  After what seemed like an argument I was given my iced tea and on my way.\n\nBack at the office I hurriedly opened my lunch to see what I had coveted all these months right in front of me.  No napkins or fork were provided (just a spoon(?) and some chopsticks (I know, those should suffice), but at this point I didn\'t care, all I needed was my mouth and my combo.   I was not opposed to shoveling it in with my bare hands if needed.  I procured my own fork and napkins and dug in.   It would almost be impossible to live up to my expectations, but it came very close.  The duck was tender and delicious, and the pork was very tasty but I found it to not be as moist as I expected.  The 10 lbs of rice and handful of pieces of Chinese broccoli were a good accompaniment.\n\nI was tempted to go 5 stars as dream fulfillment ranks very high on my list of pluses for a business, but the service could have been a little friendlier and the pork a little more moist for it to be the perfect experience.', 'business_id': 'P8DQlNd4ZVCtxFsH_QARFQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2013-04-23', 'type': 'review'}

Everybody who was eating here were Chinese and some Vietnamese.  The servers were speaking to me and my sister in Chinese and it felt like Beijing all over again.  It\'s a tiny place that seats 50 people.\n\nWe ordered roast pork, yang chow fried rice and Chinese broccoli since we weren\'t too hungry.  The traditional Chinese restaurant would serve you dishes one at a time and it\'s usually the quickest one to prepare is the one that gets served first.  So, we got the broccoli then the roast pork.  We were dying to eat the pork already since the skin looked so crispy and delicious...but we had to control ourselves and wait for the rice.  It didn\'t take long.  The broccoli was fresh.   The pork was super crispy and succulent - honestly, the best pork from a Chinese restaurant in Vegas!  I was very pleased and all I could say to myself was "HAOCHI! HAOCHI!" (delicious).  The fried rice had a lot of stuff in it: chopped green veggies, eggs, BBQ pork and shrimps.  \n\nWe took a BBQ pork rice bowl to-go.  I tried a piece and it was delish!  Their food is inexpensive too!  It\'s like $6-7 for a rice bowl and you get a lot of food.\n\nIf I was blown away by one dish, I can\'t wait to try the other items on their menu!  I\'ll definitely try their roast duck and something else next time.  Other Chinese restaurants in Vegas marginal roast pork. There\'s a particular place with a type of flower in their name that microwaves their roast pork making the skin gross and chewy.  I\'m also not concerned with the use of MSG...in China, they give you a small saucer of MSG!

My Midwest bud, holding his fork, looking like someone stole Christmas exclaims "why couldn\'t we eat that", pointing at the table with a plate of roast pork.\n\nThe waitress answers for us "You eat first.  Good for you.  I bring after you finish".  \n\nTo his credit he made it through the noodles and devoured the Chinese BBQ that followed.  Were talking a succulent roast duck with very little subcutaneous fat, the juicy meat permeated by star anise and bathed in its own juices and pur\xe9ed innards; moist, salty roast pork with a golden, blistered crisp crackling skin, and a deeply flavored char siu, moist, some burnt bits for bitterness, sweet with a delicate fermented aftertaste.\n\nSure, the roast pork and char siu was a little lean but  this is health conscious 2013.\n\nVery inexpensive noodles and rice plates (roasted meats, duck, chicken over rice with choy sum).

We were supposed to get pho but I stumbled on this page while searching and couldn't resist after seeing the bbq, noodles, and jook or congee. \n\nBeing the driver has it's perks such as making an executive decision to hole in the wall restaurants on the whim. \n\nThis time we went into the restaurant with a party of 7. They had no problem seating us. Half way into the meal people started filling up the restaurant. It seemed like we just beat the rush. \n\nWe sat down got our menus and some hot tea. \n\nThe waiters passed by us several times as we were ready to order. We had that foreigner veil over our table and service will seem to be slower than if I were to be with my parents. No big deal, it's something I've gotten used to. \n\nEventually I am able to wave down a waitress. I exercised my Cantonese and ordered as many of the dishes I could recognize. The waitress had no problem taking the orders in English but dropping some Chinese usually makes the service a bit better. It's not guaranteed. \n\nWe ordered a lot of food to share, family style. BBQ pork and Duck, Combo fried rice, Beef chow fun, Seafood pan fried noodles, a bowl of congee, and 1 bowl of wonton noodles for me and a bowl of braised beef noodles for my friend. \n\nThe first item to come to the table was the fried rice. My friend said it smelled sooooo good as the waitress set it on the table. And it really was good. Everything was great. But I would have probably skipped the beef chow fun and I felt the braised beef was better than the wonton noodles. \n\nIn the end I ordered too much. We still had a lot of bbq pork and roast duck left over so we boxed it up and took it back to the hotel. After a long nap the next day, three of us devoured the left overs like primitive hungover cavemen; in our dark, curtain covered, cave like hotel room.\n\nSadly they ran out of roast pork just before we ordered.

Now if you're a little hung over like I was, I'd recommend getting some kind of soup. There's lots to choose from so just pick a noodle and your toppings and you'll be good to go. If you're lucky enough to be there when they have suckling pig, GET IT. I actually haven't had it but..I'm sure it's amazing as well :D\n\nService was..well Chinese haha (I can say that because I'm Chinese, I know how we are). Most of the waitresses are hard to flag down and if they're busy, rather than say they'll be right with us they'll just put a hand up and go about their business. Their English is limited though so that may have something to do with it. There was one guy, maybe he was the owner? He was actually very nice and personable. He chatted with people, made sure we got our orders, etc. He should maybe show the other waitresses how it's done.\n\nAnyway, this might just be a LV hang-over tradition for me from now on ^_^", 'business_id': 'P8DQlNd4ZVCtxFsH_QARFQ', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2013-07-18', 'type': 'review'}

This time round, I ask the same lady again : "can u PLEASE give me extra sauce. Here comes her answer : "There\'s already sauce on you rice". and she was real eager to collect $$$ from me and get me out of her sight. obviously I knew it, doesn\'t she understand what is EXTRA sauce? \n\nCould not explain how angry I was when I left the shop. I was asking myself maybe I should have asked her :" Can I pay you for some extra sauce?"', 'business_id': 'P8DQlNd4ZVCtxFsH_QARFQ', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2013-09-19', 'type': 'review'}

Their prices are awesome as well -- they\'re not going to burn a hole in your wallet however! It is CASH ONLY. So don\'t come here with a credit card cause that isn\'t going to help you. Although the wonderful thing is, there is a Wells Fargo, Chase, and BoA somewhere down the street of Spring Mountain. \n\nLike many people have said .. absolutely LOVE their roast pork. It is full of flavor and a good combination of meat and fat. It goes GREAT with rice! So don\'t be afraid to get that combo :P\n\nTheir roast duck and bbq pork is only okay though. I\'ve had better bbq pork. As for their roast duck, it\'s good however their sauce ruins it for me. They left the herbs in the sauce and the concentration of the flavors of the herbs are just too much for me ..it ruins the flavor of the duck rather than complimenting it. \n\nAlso, love their noodles and fried rice. I\'ve tried their "chei jai mein" which is a street cart food back overseas. For here, you get to choose the type of noodle you want then choose 1-3 items, such as pork intestines and pork blood. It was quite yummy :D Wasn\'t bad at all. BUT, I typically like to use chili oil with my noodles however theirs isn\'t that great ... Next time, I\'ll bring my own! \n\nAwesome authentic Chinese food. Can\'t go wrong. Don\'t worry about the service cause for the food you get, to hell with service. It\'s a Chinese place ... just be loud when trying to get their attention and you\'re good to go! HAHA  But in all reality, when I\'ve eaten here, I haven\'t really experienced any rude attitude  .. maybe because I haven\'t been here enough? Tehee. \n\nGive it a try :) If anything, just order take out.', 'business_id': 'P8DQlNd4ZVCtxFsH_QARFQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2013-10-08', 'type': 'review'}

I had the roasted pork belly (aka crispy pork) and the roasted duck as my options, and I have no regrets. These two meats actually bring back childhood memories from when my parents used to order trays of them from a local butcher and we\'d enjoy them at home with some rice that we\'d cooked.\n\nEvery table in the restaurant was taken - go figure - so I got my order in a to-go box. Instant nostalgia with the pork and duck laid on a bed of rice, plus a healthy side of Chinese cabbage. I just had the time of my life sitting in my car eating these delights. The pork was chopped into very manageable rectangular portions, each with perfectly crunchy skin, a layer of white, and a layer of dark meat. The duck pieces had lovely golden brown skin and a very anise-y seasoning on the bottom. Make sure to expect bones if you order the roasted duck, and you\'ll just have to kinda slice or bite them off to get to the meat.\n\nI\'m already plotting my next trip back.

It doesn't get any better than Asian BBQ & Noodles.  I'm not just talking about Las Vegas, it beats places in Hawaii, LA, and SF!!  I know this is a bold statement, but this place is the best I have been to.  The roast duck is succulent, juicy, and done to perfection.  Even the Jus that comes with the duck tastes awesome.  I don't know what blend of spices they use, but it is mouthwateringly delicious.  The best part is, its not overly greasy and oily like duck from other places.  I don't feel as if my arteries are clogging as I'm eating.  The roast pork is divine.  The skin is perfectly crunch, but not so thick that you chip a tooth (my dad did that once, not cool).  The pork is also seasoned with the same or similar spices as the duck.  First time I've had it done this way.  Adds an added flavor profile not found anywhere else!!  The char siu is very flavorful.  Sweet without being too sweet.  Some of the best char siu I've ever had.  Writing this review is making my mouth water.  There are many other dishes to try, but I have yet to sit down and try one of their noodle bowls.  One of these days, but for now I'm good with taking a duck to go.", 'business_id': 'P8DQlNd4ZVCtxFsH_QARFQ', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2014-01-27', 'type': 'review'}

If anything, in my opinion, its the best in Vegas. \n\nFirst of all..... CASH ONLY ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Make sure you have cash, otherwise no yummy food for you ! Applies for entire restaurant, not only the BBQ. Wells Fargo, Chase, and Bank of America are down the street, less than 1/4 mi away.\n\nOk now that\'s over. This is a nice little place, in the opposite corner (NE) of the same center as Q Karaoke, HK Star, Cue D\'s, and China Mama. Quite busy during lunch and dinner hours and they close early. \n\nThey have a variety of foods, that you would normally find in a traditional chinese BBQ place. Noodles, rice plates, fried rice, veggies, etc. Some of their popular dishes would be the "Noodle Soups" with a variety of noodles and toppings or the traditional wonton (\u991b\u98e9) or shui jiao (\u6c34\u9903) dumpling. \n\nOne different thing about this place, that sets it apart from the rest, is their "Cart Noodle" (\u8eca\u4ed4\u9eb5). Originated in Hong Kong, it was originally sold on carts. Noodles were freshly cooked to order, with your pick of toppings ranging from pig feet, pig skin, pig stomach, pig intestines, pig blood, etc (continuing on to beef and chicken parts as well). \n\nThis place, gives you a choice of a variety of noodles, and your pick of either 1, 2 or 3 toppings. My favorite combination is Thin Egg Noodles with Pig Intestine, Mix Beef, and Pig Feet. \n\nThe noodles will be cooked to a chinese style of al dente (when its done right...) It should NOT be too soft, but not undercooked hard. It should give a nice bite. \n\nAnother popular item would be their "BBQ on Rice" ranging from Roasted Pork on Rice, BBQ Pork on Rice, Roast Duck on Rice, Combination of Two on Rice. As you can see, they have fresh roasted items avail, hanging and cut to order. \n\nTheir Roast Pork is one of my favorites. Priced at a little less than $11/lb for a to-go order (price is different if eaten there), but its a good deal. This is one of the few places in town, that prepare only the belly, vs the entire pig. No bones. All same sizes. Better bang for the buck, right? Crispy bubbled pig skin, wonderfully seasoned, nice proportioned meat to fat ratio, cut to bite sized pieces. Good to snack on (yes ive bought this as a snack) or eaten with your meal ! \n\nThe guys who cut the items are actually fairly accurate. If you want 1 lb, they will be fairly close on it. \n\nTheir roast duck is also a good item to order. Crispy skin, meaty and flavored nicely. Good combination to be eaten with rice or noodles. Can be ordered to-go in half or whole duck. \n\nIf none of the above appeals to you, their fried rice and noodles are nicely done as well ! Good "wok hei" as what chinese would call it. Its like an extra flavor that appears when you use a high flame and a wok to cook things. Almost imagine it as, maybe a smokey flavor? \n\nGreat place for a quick bite to eat or with a few people, or even to go and bring home for dinner', 'business_id': 'P8DQlNd4ZVCtxFsH_QARFQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2014-02-03', 'type': 'review'}

One thing I do applaud them for is the service, the service was greeat! We were treated like human beings, which not very common at Chinese restaurants.

Don't get me wrong, their BBQ is probably the best I've had in town, but the other items on their menu? Not so good and I would not get it again.\n\nFirst thing you'll notice when you walk in are the BBQ meats hanging from the window by the back counter. Their roast pork belly with the crispy skin is to die for and their BBQ pork is really good as well. I haven't tried the chicken or duck so can't comment on it but from the looks of everything hanging in the window, it looks pretty damn delicious. You can order meats as an order or rice plate combo. If ordering to go, everything is by weight.\n\nThe other items are another story. I've tried the congee, BBQ pork chow fun, Chinese broccoli and a combo soup noodle w/ pig feet and curry beef tendon. The congee was meh, so-so; I've definitely had better at dim sum places. The BBQ pork chow fun was the only thing good out of this group and probably only because it had BBQ pork. The Chinese broccoli was all stems and very little leafy parts which was disappointing and the soup noodle was terrible because the noodles were clumped together which made it difficult to eat.\n\nBecause this is a traditional Chinese style restaurant, service is not very good and it'll take a while to get someone's attention even though they have many employees roaming the restaurant at any given time. Also, don't bother speaking to them in Mandarin because their English is definitely a lot better than their Mandarin...they'll just look at you like they understand and then they'll disappear and you'll never get what you asked for. We spoke to 3 different waiters in Mandarin trying to get our check and to go boxes and 1 by 1 they disappeared and were never seen again. After waiting 10 min and speaking with 3 waiters, we ended up going up to one of the ladies and speaking to her in English and magically we got what we wanted. If they didn't understand us then why wouldn't they just say so? How rude! Definitely 1 star for service based on my most recent visit! But their BBQ is good and I'll continue coming back just for that, but not anything else though", 'business_id': 'P8DQlNd4ZVCtxFsH_QARFQ', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2014-07-18', 'type': 'review'}

The white rice had a splash of meat drippings on it and really made the plate of food special. They served a complimentary soup that I liked. It was a nice start to the fatty dishes. The pan fried noodles were okay- kind of small portion of protein.\n\nThe BBQ\'d meats were really good and each stood out in their own way. I was initially put off by the staff\'s lack of urgency with getting our order as opposed to diners who sat after us. There was a gentleman who sat after us, got soup, and got his entree before we even got water or placed an order. I\'m glad the lady who came up to us did when she did because she was very sweet and helped us decide what to order. I\'ll give them the benefit of the doubt this time..\n\nIt ended up being a solid four as the food and sweet lady out weighed the bad. I really liked my dinner.

The seating is a bit cramped like they might have put one too many tables in there. The service is quick and efficient even if it's a little robotic. The prices were good, you can leave there having spent under $10 a person and feel like you've more than gotten your money's worth.\n\nParking is plentiful and the location is easy to find. \n\nOverall, I'd say if you have a desire for chinese bbq, you can't do any better in Vegas.", 'business_id': 'P8DQlNd4ZVCtxFsH_QARFQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2015-10-16', 'type': 'review'}

I noticed the duck and pork hanging and I was in awe and drooling over it. I love roast duck and roast pork. You know your in a good Asian restaurant went you smell like the food. I ordered the bbq 2 combination plate of roast duck and roast pork. My uncle got the same plate but with bbq instead of the roast pork. Now as for flavors, the pork has a good balance of Chinese 5 spice and cooked long enough to be tender to the teeth. The duck was awesome also. Love that skin and flavors on it. Just what I'm looking for when I roast duck. \n\nNow my only gripe to this place and why I gave it 3 stars was that while I was waiting to get my food, I seen a couple of flies roaming around and at least one flying in the steam table. As a person who works in the restaurant industry especially in the back of the house, that is a red flag. That is no Bueno. Not good in my eyes.

When ordering, we asked a question about the menu, and we got a loud and rude response back. I asked our server for some extra sauce, and her response was, "They are too busy back there.

The meat is tender and the skin of the pork belly is crispy! The presentation for most dishes are decent (for those who enjoy taking photos of their meal like I do).
