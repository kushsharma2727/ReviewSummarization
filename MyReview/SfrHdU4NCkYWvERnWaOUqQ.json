In fact, I'd say the food here is forgettable at best. And yet I give the Hill five stars because of the absolutely stellar treatment they give my elderly grandparents. My grandma and grandpa eat here at least once a week; they take a lot of their food home as leftovers and they have a variety of special requests. Yet, none of this seems to faze the friendly folks at Blueberry Hill (who greet my grandparents by name and know which tables they like, and make sure to seat them there). Every appeal is met with a smile, which I have seen firsthand when I visit the restaurant with my grandparents on trips back home. \r\n\r\nIt warms my heart every time I walk in this place.

She finally came to take my order 20 minutes later.\nI got the Rum/coconut/pineapple waffle, then asked for their $6.50 special, it was supposed to be 3 eggs, 3 sausages or bacon, hash browns, and toast or english muffin. Since I don\'t like sausage or bacon, I asked if I could have pancakes instead.\n I\'ve NEVER had a problem substituting sausages for eggs or pancakes, but she hesitated and said "yea but it\'ll be regular price not special price, which is $8". \nFine, not a problem, $1.50 more whatever, "Can I have the apple pancakes?" \n"yea that\'s $2 extra, and you only get 2 not 4" \nThat\'s fine too, then I said, " with english muffin please" \n "Oh, no you don\'t get toast, because you\'re already getting the pancakes." then she turn around and left! \nI had to yell above the noise just to get her back, "UH EXCUSE ME! I thought the pancakes were replacing my sausage/bacon not toast!, PLUS I\'m paying $4 extra for them." \nShe didn\'t respond and reached for an english muffin, and put it in the toaster without even turning toward me!\n\nFOOD:\nWaffle: the waffle itself has a nice texture, but the toping is wayyyy too sweet and pie-filling-like, and the pineapple is not fresh, it\'s from a can. not worth the $8.50. \nPancakes: they might as well call these "cakes" and not "pancakes"! they have absolutely no texture or taste of having been on a griddle, I bet thy baked them! each one is about 3/4 of an inch thick and fluffy/crumbly as hell! If you like your pancake to taste like cake, then this would be your thing, but I prefer my pancakes to be just pancakes. they are also too salty and have too much baking soda which makes them extremely tannic. \nTheir description also said that there were apples baked into the pancakes topped with fresh apple slices and compote (apple sauce), but there wasn\'t any of these things: no apple in the plain pancakes, compote was actually a jelly/custardy substance like in a bad apple pie, fresh apple slices were cooked apple chunks. \n\nHash browns: hash browns are supposed to be crispy, shredded potato, not chopped up, day-old, fettucine! \n\nthe 1 English muffin for which I was charged $1 extra: completely burned center with about 1/2 inch edible border. \n\nWhipped cream that topped the pancakes and waffle: out of a can! you\'d think that a "family style" diner would whip some real cream, but no. \n\nEggs: plain old scrambled eggs, difficult to screw up.  the only thing that tasted as expected in this meal.', 'business_id': 'SfrHdU4NCkYWvERnWaOUqQ', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2009-08-03', 'type': 'review'}

I went with my servers recommendation and chose the apple chicken sausage waffle and a side of eggs.\n\nThe food in a word: fantastic! They use Aidells sausage which is typically $7 a pack at the grocery store and a strong sign they are shooting for quality instead of using bullshit like most places (ie. Dennys/IHOP). The waffles topped with little cinnamon and accompanied with an excellent sweet whipped butter was great. The sausage was excellent and perfectly matched the waffle. The eggs while simply scrambled and served on a plate were also very solid, they chose to cook them in butter adding an extra kick that stepped up the eggs from typical diner expectations. The meal was $10.50, $7.99 for the waffle and 1.87 for the eggs and was a great value.

It's homemade and there is some love put into it. I would give this place a solid 4 for the food on a usual night (see- it's not something I'd rate as a 4 for a daytime breakfast- it's just A-OK) , but today the service was a miss and my pigs in a blanket didn't really have pigs. \n\nWe were sat right away and a guy came to give us water and our drinks (not a server)....then we sat forever, and forever. BF waved down a guy to ask if someone can take our order. We then see him go get another guy and overhear their conversation that basically concluded that if we didn't speak up we would have never gotten an order because the guy didn't know there was anyone in his section. Gee, drink guy or lady who sat us, maybe tell the server if he's on break or maybe if he wasn't on break and doing other tasks to check his section once in a while. With the many staff we saw hanging out in the kitchen talking and hanging out or walking by us you'd think people would notice people waiting. We got our drinks refilled alright after the server knew we were there. \n\nBF got a Chef's Special- 2 French toast, 2 eggs and 2 sausages. - pretty good and standard.\n\nMom in law got 2 biscuits&gravy w/ sausage and egg. Light biscuits and the gravy was nice and chunky with sausage and mushroom bits. Pretty decent. \n\nI got Apple Chicken Sausage Pigs in a Blanket- good sausage and the pancakes were light, fluffy and moist. Big hangup though- sheisty on the sausages! I have standard sized pancakes and I open them and only a HALF of a sausage was in each pancake......so it only had  half the pancake covered and the other half a empty, lonely blanket. (see picture) C'mon, most of the breakfast plates have more sausages than that. I ordered the 4 pigs thinking like most places that offer that many make a smaller pancake or a oval pancake that can surround a sausage from end to end. Better off getting a breakfast special so you can get pancakes, sausages, AND egg AND hasbrowns and maybe even some bacon or ham for the same price and wrap it yourself. I just think for $8.50 I should at least get enough sausage for the pancakes. Disappointing. \n\n I know I don't feel well and am high off medication, but even I noticed that the tab was more than it should be. (see picture) Just saying, check your bills.  It was tabbed at $39.38 when it should be $30.42. Most places give you a electronic bill stapled to the original written pad, but here its totaled on the pad by hand.

Our only complaint was the service. Once we got our food we didn't get visited by our waiter for a very long time.  We needed refills on our drinks and it took forever. We couldn't even flag down our waiter to get help. I recommend going for the food despite the service, but I warn you to be prepared for mediocre service.

The restaurant was quiet, since it was so late, but it was also very clean, and the people working there were all very nice.\n\nI ordered the chicken sausage pigs in a blanket.

The chicken sausage is delicious- it's one of my favorite things to buy from Whole Foods, so I'm so happy that they use it here at Blueberry Hill! But these pancakes are killer! They are gigantic and about a half inch thick. Don't be put off by their prices. When they say three pigs in a blanket, they mean three gigantic pancakes.

I remembered the 4am breakfast so awesome that I had to come back the next weekend. But this last weekend was so disappointing!\n\nFirst of all! I hate big menus. I sat there longer than I wanted because of all the damn pages I had to go through. It was like reading a novel. I was so confused on what I should get.\n\nI ordered the egg benedict. The hollandaise sauce was horrible!!! It tasted like some type of gravy that was made out of pre mixed powder and felt like it was suppose to be used on chicken fried stake instead! It was grainy, too thick, and bland. Hash brown was soggy and chewy. The only thing I liked was the whipped butter that was served with my toast, and that's sad when a condiment is better than rest of the dish.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the classic omelet, and you can tell they use sliced fake cheese because it sticks to the roof of your mouth to the point where I had to use a fork to get it out. Eww! I really hate restauranant cuts corners and uses fake and preserves to cut on their costs.\n\nMaybe I'm just really jaded when it comes to breakfast, but I'd rather pay a bit more for a good plate of food with amazing favors than okay price for plain food.

The tortillas seemed homemade. The biscuits and gravy were delicious. The biscuits were fluffy and definitely tasted like they were made from scratch. The bacon was ordered extra crispy, and it was just that. I was impressed with the large menu. I am not a big breakfast eater, but I do love Mexican choices. Their was a great variety from their  South of the Border selections.\n\nThe restaurant prides itself on being a "family restaurant" which is probably why they played Christian Rock and Christian Hot Adult Contemporary music. Now, I am not really religious, but I wasn\'t offended. It just seemed a bit odd. It seems strange to have Christian music playing at the family restaurant that also has video poker machines. The worst part about Christian music is not the message, but the fact that it is not good music. I probably would have added an extra star if it weren\'t for this music.\n\n If you hate Christian music or this quasi-proselytism, then this is not the place for you.

You see legitimate users with legitimate reviews frequently get filtered, and you see 4-5 star ratings for restaurants that provide a low quality product. \n\nFor years, I kept reading on Yelp that "Blueberry Hill" has the "greatest hand breaded chicken fried steak in all of Las Vegas". There was nothing true about that statement.  The chicken fried steak was nothing more than the processed precooked version that you get at Costco and Smart N Final. All they do is reheat it and serve. I was very disappointed on account of all the good reviews on yelp about how the steak was a "real sirloin that was hand battered". \n\nThe side salad was merely lettuce with 1 ring of red onion, served in a beaten up plastic bowl. No tomatoes, no cheese, no croutons...nothing. The Ranch dressing tasted like water mixed with mayonnaise.  \n\nThe biscuit that came with our steaks tasted like garlic bread. \n\nThe corn bread that came with our steak never came out. The server forgot to bring it out. We never got it. \n\nOn a positive note. The Buser was very hard working and made up for the poor quality service that the server provided. The server was not rude, but she was very forgetful and never came around one time to check on us. You need to flag down the server to get her attention. The Buser compensated for the lack of service by coming around to refill our coffee and water. The server was usually found sitting at the counter and reading a book.\n\nWhen I asked the server for Tabasco, she forgot. 10 minutes later I asked her again and she finally got it. When I asked the server for Jam, she forgot. When I asked her for saltine crackers, she forgot. She did bring out the check immediately though before we even touched our food. \n\nIn conclusion. The bill came out quicker than the food. The buser was the hardest working guy here. The food was processed and low quality. The prices were pretty high.

I noticed when we walked in that there was NO atmosphere at all! The place is very beige: beige tile going a third of the way up the walls, beige linoleum, etc.It reminded me a lot of a budget motel dining or banquet room. Very generic and boring. I was expecting a few pictures on the walls of blueberries or some country type pictures with a name like Blueberry Hill Family Restaurant but there were no pictures at all.\nIt was pretty busy. The place was about 85% full. After a couple of minutes, our server came over. Didn't catch her name but she was friendly, upbeat and had a smile on her face. After looking over the big menu, I had decided on two eggs sunny side up, hash browns, and a short stack of pancakes. Hubby wanted pancakes too so after learning the short stack is three pancakes, we decided we'd split a stack: two for him and one for me. Hubby also ordered a Denver omelet which came with either hash browns or chunky potatoes (his choice: chunky), and choice of toast (his choice: whole wheat).\nWe both just wanted water to drink.\n\nAfter a reasonable amount of time our order came. My hash browns, what little there were of them, were SMEARED onto my plate! Not an appetizing display & it was the tiniest amount of hash browns I'd ever been served in a restaurant! \nOn a brighter note, my sunny side up eggs looked beautiful. The pancakes came with hot maple syrup on the side. After tasting everything, there was some good news but mostly bad news: the hash browns, not surprisingly from the way they looked, tasted terrible! Greasy and the grease tasted OLD! YUCK!! The eggs were cooked perfectly although they had no seasoning on them at all which I easily rectified with the shakers on the table. The pancakes were overcooked. When I cut into them, the top layer separated from the rest and they were chewy. If they'd just been cooked a minute or two less...\n\nHubby said his omelet was good and it was a decent size. I tried his chunky potatoes which were good, not great, but markedly better than my hash browns. The portion size of his potatoes was small too. His toast was fine. \n\nOur server never came by after we had tried our food to ask how things were. \nWe had to flag her down to get the check.\n\nWe were disappointed in our experience at Blueberry Hill, especially after hearing such great things about it! We might go back one more time to try it again. Maybe they were just having a bad day? If we do, I'll post another review then.", 'business_id': 'SfrHdU4NCkYWvERnWaOUqQ', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2012-09-07', 'type': 'review'}

Having been New Years Day, many local places weren't open, and we didn't want to go to a chain breakfast place (ala IHOP, etc). We liked seeing a few people go in and seem to know each other as well as the staff. Regulars are always a nice sign for me!\n\nThe place is clean and basic diner feel. Nothing to the blueberry hill...I thought it would have blueberries or be more 50's like the song. Still clean and next to taste of food,  that's important when I eat out!\n\nMy husband had some kind of rancheros type thing I forgot the name in Spanish. It was scrambled eggs with tortilla chips in them served with beans, rice, etc. He said it was okay, and didn't care for the tortilla chips cooked in the eggs. The salsa they served on the side was very fresh, flavorful and delicious.\n\nI had the crepes with a cheese type apple compote inside and whipped cream on top. It was so delicious!!!! Our portions were very large and neither of us could finish them. \n\nService was pleasant and not too pushy. I'm more of the European mindset of being left alone between receiving items and dislike when servers come over every 5 minutes. They should keep an eye on you, but not keep coming over to interrupt if you're having a lively conversation and it's obvious we don't need anything (like some places I've been to)...this one was really casual with just the right amount of service.\n\nMy only suggestion is that they make gluten free pancakes too. They advertise it's made from scratch so it's easy to substitute wheat flour with rice flour and a couple other tweaks. That's the only personal downside, however the waitress suggested I send in some recipes and write the owners. I think I will as this would be a nice place to become a regular patron of.  \n\nBTW - they are open 24 hours and their daily specials look pretty good!

The portions are overly proportioned and very worth the price you pay. I had the strawberry pancakes which was more like a tower of pancakes and strawberries. I didn\'t even eat half of it.

Situated on Decatur and the largest of a handful of locations spanning the city the look and feel of the restaurant can best be summed up as an upscaled Denny\'s with better coffee alongside a more creative menu and given my early hour of arrival the service was exemplary - an older couple entering just after me the restaurant\'s only other patrons.  A skeleton crew in the kitchen largely focused on preparing the day\'s housemade cakes and pastries it was with little delay that decisions were made from the extensive menu and orders placed I chatted with my waitress at length, the longtime veteran of Blueberry Hill keeping coffee filled to the brim and commending my picks while offering suggestions for \'next time\' - an occurrence that will be sooner rather than later given the quality of what soon arrived.  Beginning savory and moving to sweet it was with a loaded un-fried Monte Cristo that I began and deferring standard jam with a request for the housemade strawberry compote I\'d strongly recommend everyone do the same as the ample sweetness proved a lovely balance to briny ham and smoked turkey..."balance" completely ignored by my second selection, the pillow soft pancakes chock-a-block full of crushed cookies and smeared with frosting identical in flavor to the cream-filling, plus whipped cream for garnish.  Sated and heavily caffeinated it was perhaps a bit gluttonous to consider dessert but unable to pass on a rotating cake-case it was with a slice of Red Velvet that I made my departure and waiting until the afternoon to indulge the results were good, if not great, as the cake was moist and rich though I\'d have preferred more tang to the icing...a small quibble at $3 for the 11.6oz \'slice.\'', 'business_id': 'SfrHdU4NCkYWvERnWaOUqQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2014-01-12', 'type': 'review'}

It was accompanied by some awful hashbrowns, extra crispy bacon, and deliciously spongy french toast.\n\nThe size of the kid's chocolate chip pancakes ($5.39) was ridiculous. It consisted of three pancakes that would have been challenging for any adult to finish, let alone a six year old. Chocolate chips were sprinkled on top and worked into the batter and a mound of whipped cream topped it all off.

We came in here and there were alot of people waiting to sit down (20 min wait) which is usually a good sign. We waited almost exactly 20 min for our table. Our server was Jacelyn. She took our drink order and we were on our way into our Blueberry hill experience. My 5 year old was quick to point out how dirty her silverware was. They must have just missed this batch as there was some black and  brown left over crusted on her knife and fork. We gave Jacely our order as I ordered the strawberry pancakes because the picture on the menu looked fabulous. My girl got the meatlovers skillet, my daughters the strawberry french toast and happy face pancakes. The order took about 13 min to come to our table. That is when the fun began. We gave Jacely our entire order the first time around. She forgot about half of it. Missing eggs, toast, no whipped creame, no ketchup, no powdered sugar. I noticed i had only 3 pancakes when the picture clearly showed 4 and was smothered with strawberry sauce and whipped creame. Mine had non of this. Just a little dribble of sauce and a ice creame scoop of butter. I thought, well maybe they are busy, however this is supposed to be a top line breakfast joint. They should know that weekend business would be extreme so why the mess up. Anyway I ate about half my breakfast before our server came back with the whipped creame, forgot the everything else. Had to tell her again what was missed as she walked away paying attention to other people, no biggie. She returned with no hash browns and no sugar. my daughter wont touch her french toast without powered sugar and again had to ask Jacelyn for the rest of our order. I never got my hash browns and just figured she was real busy and forgot. That wasnt the kicker, the people next too me ordered the same strawberry pancake dish as mine and hers was entirely different. 1 more pancake, tons of strawberry dressing, whipped cream on top as i didnt have any at all as Jacelyn forgot our request. I asked the lady what she had ordered, same as mine, i thought WTF....Jacelyn never came back to check our drinks so at this point i am pretty irritated. Since my breakfast was not that good to begin with, I tried my daughters french toast. she said be careful daddy as there are hard things in my meal. I was like WTF again. I took a bite and instantly bit down on something hard as a rock. I spit it out and my daughters french toast had tons of uncooked rice in her meal. At this point I was like f this place. We got our check and i couldnt leave fast enough. The service was terrible. I thought if this supposed to be top notch breakfast place they must have missed the hiring procedure with Jocelyn as she squeaked by and has a job here. At hash house a go go i am sure she would be fired on the spot as they would not accept the type of service Jacelyn puts out. Didnt want to even deal with the drama of talking to a manager at this point, so my advice dont believe the hype. Find a secluded Dennys as you will get an overall better product than Blueberry Hill Restaurant.

I miss the one that used to be the base and so I do not go as much as I used to.  I was greeted promptly by a lady named Susie (more about how she saved the day later) and she sat me in a quiet section of the restaurant.  I had came in very early and so there were not many people in the place yet.  What happened next upset me so that I was preparing to walk out.  There were at least four to five female servers  standing around gabbing about their weekend and none of them acknowledged me.  I was there at the table at least for ten minutes and then there was a lady that was sat right behind me and literally right when her tush hit the sea one of those servers went right over and took her order.  I was stunned.  so  I calmly got my stuff together and went up to cash register because in spite of no one asking for my order I was still going to place an order because I enjoy their food. There was a lady named Pam that came to the register (I am going to assume she was the morning manager) and she asked me if everything was OK and I told her no.  She asked why and I told her and she was visibly upset and turned to the four servers who were back in their huddle and asked them why was I not served.  Susie, the server who was in a different section promptly said "sweetie I will get you served as soon as possible " sat me down took my order and apologized for All the servers and the lack of respect and customer service that occurred  I so appreciated her and her kindness that I tipped her Before I got my meal. She is a sweet lady from New York and I get the feeling has been a server for years and she can teach the younger generation a thing or two.  I am one of the people that realize serving tables in a restaurant is not easy and I believe in tipping great servers well and Susie is a great server.   Another gentleman that worked in Susie section and bused her tales  named Freddy was also super nice.  I was prepared never to come back to this location but just with those kind gestures it made me change my mind.

I wish I had ordered something else. \n\nOne of the off putting things for me was the menu. As another review mentioned, he thought Cheesecake Factory was bad, but wow this place has too big of a menu. I hate when restaurants throw every possible option in the world at you. It makes it very difficult to make decisions, it puts more stress on the kitchen, and instead of deciding between a handful of great options like Babystacks, I was choosing between Mexican style breakfast or not haha it was overwhelming. I prefer a restaurant to put out what it does best. Keeps it simple, keeps the food good. \n\nThe prices also were good but not great. If it was cheaper I would have been less upset with my meal.

Anyways we had pancakes, country fried steak, etc. and it was very good. Not the best in Vegas (see another one one of my posts), but easily second in my book.

We were sitting for about 15 minutes and no one had even come to take our drink order. I had to find a waitress and ask if we could order our drinks and our food. When ordering, my friend wanted french toast, which comes with a side of eggs and bacon. She did not want the eggs and asked if there was a way to replace the eggs with something else. They made the request seem so unreasonable. The waitress (in training) had to grab another waitress, and that waitress had to ask the manager. After the whole ordeal, the waitress came to the conclusion that my friend only wanted bacon and did not want french toast. It was very difficult to watch the incompetent staff. The waitress said she would check with the manager to see if the request could be fulfilled, yet she never got back to us. Again after about 10 minutes of wondering I had to grab her and ask what the manager had decided. She was unable to give me a certain answer, so we were going to have to wait and see. When the food came out, my friend was able to get another slice of bacon, but the waitress threatened that this was a one time thing, and next time they would have to charge for extra bacon (we were simply trying to substitute the item we did not want). Lastly, we were waiting to get the paycheck and I was just staring at the waitresses talking, it took about five minutes for them to ask if I needed help and when I asked for the check, she said she was going to give it to me, but she was waiting for my friend and I to finish talking first. I have never been so displeased. I understand our waitress was training a new employee, but she should have been attentive to us as well.

Our first stop on a quiet Friday morning was Blueberry Hill. We showed up a little after 11AM and the crowd seemed sparse. Because of this, our group was taken immediately to a comfy window booth, had our menus handed to us and drink orders taken. Within minutes our coffees and water arrived.. all positives so far.\n\nWe were given a couple more minutes (as requested) to look over the menu, which had a LOT going on. The prices were fair, ranging from low eggs and bacon at around $4 to steak and eggs pushing $12. Although the place is called 'Blueberry Hill', I didn't feel the need to try something with blueberries or that sauce in it. I'm a HUGE fan of pancakes, but not at all with the dessert like toppings. Just butter and syrup please.\n\nI'm cool with the basics, so I grabbed the 1-2-3 Biscuit Special; 3 pieces of crispy bacon, over-easy eggs and they generously gave me 2 biscuits and gravy (as opposed to one). For a side to share.. we grabbed 4 pieces of french toast. \n\n..When the food's good, no one speaks. The head nod is given with a little grin that holds a mouth full of food. This is what was happening and my stomach was truly thankful. I felt all giddy inside.. My body knew it was consuming breakfast up to par with some of the best and was preparing itself for a nap already. \n\nThe biscuits and gravy were out of this world. Gravy was warm with bits and pieces of sausage in it and hints of pepper. The biscuits were nice n' fluffly, lightly lathered with butter and had a light crispness around the edges. The French toast was out of this world.. it was almost equivalent to eating donuts.. doughy, buttered and dusted with sugar.. syrup was practically not needed for these things. I have a feeling they were fried somehow.. and I'm not complaining 'bout it one bit! Dip that crispy bacon into egg yolk and let it run for the WIN. (Crowd cheers)\n\nIt didn't seem too packed in the customer department at this hour. Perhaps that's the reason we were able to get such prompt and friendly service along with a great meal. Satisfied?

The waitress took it back and deleted it off of our order. \n\nNachos- 1 star. The chips were a bit cold and stale. i was not digging it at all. \n\nVanilla malt shake- 3 star. Was good. \n\nBeef soup- 4 star. Pretty dang good, unexpectedly. \n\nChill cheese fries - 1 star. Had random brown beans that stood out on it's own as though it was just scattered on top of a chill sauce. The fries were good though. \n\nI shall go back still, to try other items.", 'business_id': 'SfrHdU4NCkYWvERnWaOUqQ', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2014-12-31', 'type': 'review'}

Our server was Jennifer and she was wonderful.  Super attentive and nice.  Our coffee and waters were brought out pretty quickly and Jennifer even offered flavored creamers that wernt stored in the caddies on the tables. \n\nAs for breakfast, I ordered pretty much the standard, two eggs over medium, bacon and hashbrowns w/ sourdough toast.  My friend ordered a huge ham and cheese omelet with sourdough toast and the biggest side of buttermilk pancakes ever.  My goodness, they were like an inch thick each and there was three of them.  Sourdough toast was of good quality ( nothing worse than cheap bread) and my god--- why was the coffee so good?  Its probably some generic bulk coffee they buy but it was delicious!\n\nMy only beef of the whole meal would probably be the hashbrowns.  I had what would be equal to a 1/2 of cup worth that was spread out onto my plate.  A little less stingy on those would have been great but lets face it, I probably wouldnt have finished them anyways!\n\nOverall, service was great, food was good and pricing was fair!', 'business_id': 'SfrHdU4NCkYWvERnWaOUqQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2015-07-18', 'type': 'review'}

Lucky for us, we were able to get seated right away. \n\nUpon scanning the menu, I ended up picking the "Grubsteaker Breakfast" ($12.59) -  which consisted of Half-Pound of 100% Certified Angus Beef topped with two slices of thick bacon smothered in cheddar cheese. Meal is served with 2 large eggs (anyway you want it), hashbrowns, & toast or a muffin. You may substitue 3 pancakes instead of toast & hashbrowns. I took my meal with the pancakes, cuz I just love pancakes! And of course I had to have my coffee too!\n\nOne of my friends also picked the "Grubsteaker Breakfast" , but he took the hashbrowns & toast. He also ordered an - Arnold Palmer. When he ordered that, I had to ask........what da hell is an "Arnold Palmer?" Basically it\'s pineapple juice & lemonade......\n\nMy other friend took the Very Berry French Toast - which was French Toast topped with stawberry & whipped cream. He also drank a vanilla milk shake.........after he had drank & eaten all of that..........he told me he had diabetes! Lol! Can we say "Sugar Overload?" Lol!\n\nWhat can I say about my meal?\n\nLove it! A great hearty breakfast! Loved the fluffy eggs........bummed that they didn\'t have shoyu, but yeah.........we not in Hawaii, we on da mainland!\nThe hamburger steak thing was ono, & meaty! The thick bacon topped with the gooiest of cheddar cheese..........how can you go wrong? Everything taste better with BACON! Lol!\n\nService was Excellent! I forgot to get our server\'s name, but she was friendly, fast, & efficient!\n\nWhat away to top off my quick trip to Las Vegas..........after eating my hearty breakfast, lunch was not needed...........\n\nI would be more than happy to come back here again for breakfast!

I had the biscuits and gravy with a side of bacon, which was amazing. Everything is obviously made from scratch. My Grandma got the banana pancakes with some pecan prailine topping, and even though when it came to she said it was too much food.... she ate it all. (With a little help) I forget what my mom got, but she was very happy with hers too. Plus the bill was under $40. And they had hazelnut creamer,which made us both happy.\n\nWe were sat pretty fast, faster than we expected since the place was busy. The wait staff was slammed but nice, they seemed to run like a well oiled machine. Our food came quicly too.\n\nWe did see lots of the tables ordering the hot chocolate. Piled up with whip cream and topped with a cookie. So, it seems like that's a thing to order. They also had homemade cakes and fudge, which we didn't try, but all looked good. \n\nAfterwards we drove to Red Rock Canyon, which was a nice break for our feet, and so beautiful. Definitely made our Sunday.", 'business_id': 'SfrHdU4NCkYWvERnWaOUqQ', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2015-12-05', 'type': 'review'}

This is not how you treat guests!!!!  Been coming here since I was a kid but after being treated this way, I\'m good. \n\nHere is also a picture of her sitting RIGHT NEXT TO THE REGISTER when we paid for the waffle and half of my boyfriends food.

The food was good I got the French toast and the ham and cheese omelette with toast and hash browns the food was really delicious the hash browns especially they were fresh and really crispy just like I like them overall I enjoyed coming here again and outside of the bad date I still got that comfort relaxing diner feeling that I got the last time I came here overall this will still be one of my good to restaurants when I want to grab some breakfast lunch or dinner.", 'business_id': 'SfrHdU4NCkYWvERnWaOUqQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2015-12-15', 'type': 'review'}
