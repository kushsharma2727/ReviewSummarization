However I've always wanted to try this place since it's in the MGM right at the Monorail entrance.  After my experience here, I wish I had tried this place sooner.\n\nIt's not exactly your traditional Mexican restaurant, as it adds some modern flair to it.  It does turn into a nightclub w/ a good variety of Latin beats and reggae-ton on Friday and Saturday Nights (starting at 11pm for you groovers).\n\nLike most Mexican restaurants, they bring you a good sized basket of chips and a trio of salsa, (pico de gallo, green tomatillo, and habanero chile).  What was really eye popping to me and my taste buds was the addition of three salts to go along w/ the chip sand salsa.  What an enhancement of flavor!  The avocado chile salt was amazing as was the chile lime salt.  Quite a rush that didn't even have us rushing for a glass of water.\n\nThey make fresh guac table side and it' pretty darn good.  I usually like having fresh cut tomatoes in my guac, however they used sun-dried tomatoes and it gave it a rather smokey and slightly tangier flavor.  For a single avocado, it sure produced quite a bit of guac for two, however it still was inhaled rather quickly.\n\nI went w/ their tasting menu which included four courses.  Two authentic  dishes, Pollo al horno Con Mole (Horny Chicken our waiter joked), and Cochinita Pobil.  The pollo was a super tender chicken thigh with chile de arbol sauce on it, marinated a various spices that I wish I could list.  The smokey and spice flavor was great.  The Cochinita was a pork tenderloin that tore apart like fresh carnitas.  It was a flavor rush of spices and slight amount of pork fat that just melted in my mouth.  The other two tasters were a fresh tuna ceviche and grilled jumbo prawns.  The prawns were spiced to perfecting, a little amount of heat, but not so much that over powered the other flavors.  The ceviche was one of the best I've had in a long time, a good mixture of fresh pico de gallo, freshly grilled tuna, lime, and muscles.  \n\nThe other dish shared was their surf and turf which consisted of a well seasoned fillet minon (good 8oz baseball cut) on top of a mixture of portabello and spinach, accompanied by two shrimp and lobster enchiladas.  The enchiladas fell short a bit of what i was expecting, but the steak was magnificent.\n\nhowever, the two dishes that put a fiesta to my taste buds were the two sides i selected.  Designed to serve two, we got the fried plantains and the sweet corn w/ chile.  OMFG!!!!!  What a rush and burst of flavor.  The plantains took about two bites before you realized the true flavor they gave.  The sweet corn was topped off w/ a light sour cream and it just melted all the way to my stomach.  Pure ecstasy in a Latin food way.  I was tempted to take and order to go for a late night snack...yes it was that good.\n\nWhat made our experience five stars was our waiter, Leo.  He was super friendly and the most attentive waiter I've had in a long time.  our cups were never below half-way down, salsas always full, fresh chips in an instant.  But what set him apart was how truly attentive he was.  our fillet was overdone from the medium rare we had requested, but it was OK, we didn't mind.  However after 3/4 of it was devoured, he noticed it was overcooked and w/o hesitation ordered us to stop and took it away from us, only to bring out a freshly done full sized fillet cooked to perfection.  Awesome, simply awesome.\n\nPricey for Mexican food for sure, but oh so worth it.  A great experience all the way around.  A full belly, and a food coma at no additional charge.", 'business_id': 'UVBElUlajafZDSiBK2pltw', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2008-02-04', 'type': 'review'}

Okay service once they found a table in the empty restaurant.  Drinks:  good, but that is not a problem in Vegas if you have $14 and a drivers license.\n\nI'd skip it and try something else.

I remember liking all three on my first visit and a different set of 3 on my second visit.  They seem to have it down in this department.  The bar also has a great selection of drinks and tequilas.  I cannot recall the dishes we ordered (its been quite some time since my last visit) but everybody in our group was pleased.  The ambiance is also nice from the standpoint that it is very open feeling with just enough privacy at the tables.", 'business_id': 'UVBElUlajafZDSiBK2pltw', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2009-11-26', 'type': 'review'}

We were excited, expecting some delicious Mexican food and a fun night of Latin dance music.  The atmosphere is pretty sleek, but it wasn't really packed enough for a Saturday night.  We ordered the queso fundido as an appetizer....it was really small, but didn't matter as it was pretty much flavorless and somewhat difficult to dip tortillas and chips into anyway.  We ordered a pticher of margaritas, and it was pretty much like a pitcher of bad, overly sugary sweet and sour mix with a little but of tequila that we could not taste. Despite having paid quite a bit for this pticher, we couldn't even finsh one glass a piece, as it was just too sickeningly sweet.  I ordered red snapper, which was the seafood special of the day.  It wasn't bad, but just wasn't exciting.  It was pretty much grilled fish on a plate of salsa.  Disappointed by the food, we rushed to the bar to try several more drinks and await the paty that was about to start.  We tried the Frida Margarita, which was a little better, but, again, we could not taste the tequila.  The bartender was really friendly, but it didn't really make up for the signature drinks of Diego.  Around 11 or so they started moving out all the chairs and tables and gave us wristbands to stay for the club.  Unfortunately, it just never got crowded.  Those who did come in, were mostly middle-aged couples.  It is possible this place gets going later at night, but around midnight, we decided to look for a better party.", 'business_id': 'UVBElUlajafZDSiBK2pltw', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2009-12-09', 'type': 'review'}

It's basically a huge chunk of pork on the bone, cooked in banana leaves.  it was really tasty and fall off the bone tender.

I'll admit, I was jealous!  And of course I helped him eat some of it.  =)  The pork he got was super bland, though. Maybe cause he got more sides to make up for the lack of flavor...?\n\nOverall, after being wow'ed by the pretty decor, I wasn't too impressed with the food.

Next, on my slow spiral into Mexican sadness we were offered guacamole. Guac is free at the restaurant I work at, so silly me says sure! Little did I know I\'d be paying top dollar for a mashed avocado with out flavor. You live, you learn. \nWhen our food came we were about ready to die from starvation. It took a little longer then I had anticipated. I was shocked! Not only did my cheese enchiladas look like two sad cheese logs in a pond of enchilada sauce, but all of our food looked so sad. I think they put it under the heat lamp way to long. \nThe bill came and being the gentleman my friend is he paid.

He loved them. They are the perfect serving and size and have a very yummy taco sauce over them. I ordered the Enchiladas. Very good sauce, and large serving size for my size. haha.....I was overly full when I left, which kind of ruined it for me, but overall, they have great food.

I wanted some salsa as hot as  the lightning storm I had just waded through, and thought Diego might be the place.  The place was packed, and the red walls lured me in.  We couldn't get a table,and since we were jet lagging bad, we ate at the bar, which turned out to be beside a waterfall.  Bathing in the negative ions of the water, I began feeling slowly refreshed, as  I took in the sophisticated red red decor and suave art works.  The friendly waitress handed me three notebooks, and I thought there was going to be a test, or at least I might get some school credit, but no, it turned out one was just the tequila menu.  By the bottle, because I wasn't going to pay $45 for a shot....so I finally focused on a Pomegranite margarita with a float of Grand Marnier, since it matched the red walls and helped me blend into the Vegas aura.  A few slurps later, and I was happily  diving into homemade chunky Haas avacado guacamole with big crispy tortilla chips,  (One slight improvement might be warmed chips.) and three salsas.  A fine way to get the palate going.  We each ordered tacos, one pork and one shrimp, and the marathon was one.  Three tacos later, I was satisfied, along with some of the tastiest refried frijoles ever!   The light touch on the food made me feel like I was back in California already!\nI'm ready to go back and dance when the restaurant turns to a club!\n The portions were so huge, I had a shopping bag full of food for the plane the next day\nNothing beats using Las Vegas as a travel hub!!!", 'business_id': 'UVBElUlajafZDSiBK2pltw', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2010-07-30', 'type': 'review'}

One of us (not I) is a high roller, so on the way to the Strip she phoned the Players' Club at MGM to see if she had enough comps for dinner at Diego for the three of us.  She did, and then some.  I'd gone there for my birthday last year and loved it, so I expected to have a good meal.  And we did!\n\nThe decor is beautiful, and the menu is many notches above your typical combination-plate Mexican joint.  Our waiter was efficient, but not terribly personable, even though I spoke to him in Spanish (and I am not just another gringa - I lived in Mexico).\n\nThe three of us shared an order of taquitos.  Normally, I skip anything deep-fried, but these looked too good to pass up, so I indulged.  Thin, hot, crisp, and not greasy, and covered with - but not drenched by - that divine Mexican crema and a good sprinkling of cotijo cheese.  Yummy!!\n\nWe shared a Chiles en Nogada salad.  I expected a very small portion for the $9 charge, but it was a full bowl:  mixed greens, thin slices of granny smith apples, walnuts, and a bunch of other stuff.  The high roller wasn't crazy about it, but I and my other friend loved it.\n\nWe also had an order of Queso Fundido.  This typical Mexican appetizer is usually just cheese and ground chorizo.  This one was truly special:  it had a few more things included, and was amazingly garnished with squash blossoms (flor de calabaza) - unheard of in the U.S.  Served with perfect, warm corn tortillas, it is not to be missed.\n\nFor our main course, we shared the Carne Asada tacos.  A large plate with the roast meat, grilled onions, black bean puree, and rice were accompanied by more of those corn tortillas that were so authentic (and so unlike the rubber we're accustomed to at other places), that I felt as if I was back in Mexico.\n\nCoffee is served with a little cup on the side containing white and brown sugar cubes and an ample amount of thin slivers of dark chocolate.  It's supposed to be melted into the coffee, but I had it sort of as a little dessert.\n\nWe left well-stuffed and very happy.

Plus the stories of tableside guacamole through Yelpers really made this place on our must-try list.\n\nWe had 2 orders of tacos (carnitas and chicken mole), tortas, guacamole, and to top it all off, a slice of chocolate tres leches.\n\nFirst the good news. Great complimentary chips with three salsa to sample - a salsa fresca, salsa verde, and a chipotle salsa. The pork tortas ($6)  were good - tender, marinated pork sandwiched in a slightly over toasted bun. The chicken mole tacos (2 tacos for $5) was well seasoned with a little Asian (?) flare to it. \n\nOkay, now the ugly. I have never had a blander guacamole ($3). During happy hour, they do not offer tableside guac... it's served directly to you so you can't adjust the flavourings. It tasted only of avocado and of little else. For three bucks, you can get a better tub of guacamole at a supermarket. Basically, don't waste your money.\n\nThe carnitas tacos (2 for $5) were rather disappointing. The meat was tough and underseasoned. Dry and greasy at the same time, the sprinkling of a watery radish salad did nothing to improve the situation.\n\nThe worst dish of the evening was the rather poor rendition of tres leches cake ($9). Tres leches cake ought to be an airy sponge cake soaking in a milky liquid - it is beautiful in its simplicity. However at Diego, the tres leches cake had an overly dry brownie consistency which made it difficult for the underlying liquid to saturate the cake. Add in some overly sweet do-dads (too sweet chocolate nibs, meringue, ice cream), the actual product had little to do with tres leches cake.\n\nOverall, some hits and misses.

Allow me to explain... The trio of salsas brought out with tortillas as we were seated were all but tasteless.  The \'made just for you, table-side guacomole\' was too salty, too much lime juice, not enough avocado - the ratios just weren\'t right, and this was sadly the theme of the meal.  The ceviche was OK, but was almost exclusively shrimp... where was the lobster that was also supposed to be in this pricey appetizer?  Obviously, ceviche needs acid to \'cook\' the protein, but the acid wasn\'t balanced or complex.  So the tastes of salt and lime where first, middle and last.  We\'ve had much better for much less cost in places less exotic than Las Vegas, such as Chicago. \n\nThe considerable lag between tortillas and \'real food\' was annoying and the music was loud.  The saturation of red in the decor was interesting from the outside but more gloomy than mood-setting once we were seated and the images on the video screens were jarring and did not contribute positively to enjoying food. \n\n I ordered two appetizers and a side as my meal, wanting to try a wider variety of their offerings that just an entree might have provided.  Queso Fundido - primary taste: salt.  Stringy cheese is always fun, but that was the highlight of my meal, this generous portion of blah.  I adore goat, but this could have been any kind of stringy, salty but otherwise tasteless protein, a mealy mastication chore.  I can\'t remember what the \'side\' was called, but was disappointed that it was regular button mushrooms smothered in a heavy, all-but-tasteless cream.  I have never tried properly prepared corn smut and was hopeful that this was what I\'d be getting.  But, no.  For those of you who might be curious, "Huitlacoche ("wee-tlah-KOH-cheh"), also referred to as Mexican corn truffle, can be eaten either cooked or fresh."  My husband\'s black beans were not as satisfying as any you could have gotten from a can and his chile rellenos (sp?) where apparently plated cold because they welded together into a dough ball with cheese in the middle.  Our overwhelming impression was food that was unimaginatively interpreted/prepared/presented, over-salted and only appropriate for the most flaccid of tastebuds. \n\nI gave a \'2\' because the pitcher of margarita was pretty good, though I am not a liquor connoisseuse.  On the other hand, the number of antacids needed to help put the memory of this meal behind us should be the better indicator of \'don\'t bother with this place\'.', 'business_id': 'UVBElUlajafZDSiBK2pltw', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2011-05-17', 'type': 'review'}

The tamales were bland, the tacos were greasy, the flank steak was overcooked (I ordered it blue rare and it came out medium.  Not medium rare, not rare.  Ew.

Our server who\'s name escapes me now was very nice and just great all around.  We decided to try the guacamole for starters.  Now, I will tell you this. I\'ve had Guac at many places including Rosa Mexicana (which I\'ve always thought was very good).  That guacamole at Diego must have had crack in it I\'m certain.  I could not stop feeding my face with that stuff.  Before I even knew what happened it was all gone.  And I felt kinda bad as my traveling companion never really stood a chance in battling with me for position over the guacamole.\n\nThe entree that I had was the Arrachera (Flank Steak).  It was pretty good. I will say that I was NOT disappointed.  By the time the meal was done I was good and full.  No dessert that night.  The only thing left to the was thank our very nice server with a gracious tip and head back to the room to get ready for night.

The salsa and chips were complimentary.  \n\nThe service is great and the food was brought out piping hot from the kitchen.  After hours in the car, this was exactly what we needed to prep us for our evening to come.  Because restaurants struggle in their first years, it's good to know that Diego lasted all this time inside the MGM.

The food is not bad, but also not enough to make up for the poor service. I had the Puerco Pibil, which is basically slow cooked pork shoulder. The pork was really tender--fork tender and juicy which was a good thing. However, the overall flavor of the pork was way too subtle, and I found myself having to supplement the dish with salsa from the chips and salsa. The pork was supposedly marinated in orange and banana leaves, but I tasted none of those things. Also the dish was under-salted. The best part of the meal was the fresh guacamole, which is made at the table side by a dedicated guacamole server (who knew there was such a thing). The guacamole was creamy, citrusy, and ripe with fresh flavors. \n\nThe service we received was literally laughable. Just to be fair, the bad service may be unique to our particular server (one of the male servers)--the other servers seemed to be more attentive. When we initially were getting ready to place our food orders, our waiter abruptly said "I\'ll be back," before I had a chance to ask a question about the menu and before the other members of my group were able to place their order. Then we did not see him again for quite a while. Every time our waiter left our table, we would not see him again for half an hour or so. On top of this, he never asked if we had any questions. At one point, the waiter had mentioned that he was getting off work at 11 and that we were his last table to serve. He definitely seemed more interested in being done with work and flirting with the girls at the restaurant (guys are people too!).  By the end of the night (it started off evening and was well into the night by the time we finished our meal due to painfully slow service), we were all laughing (I had tears in my eyes) about the service. It was almost like we were on an episode of candid camera or Punk\'d, and someone was trying to see what it would take to get us really pissed off. Sometimes, all you can do is laugh (and write a scathing Yelp review).', 'business_id': 'UVBElUlajafZDSiBK2pltw', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2012-06-17', 'type': 'review'}

Reluctantly, I could only eat half of it.  After which my soft fish tacos arrived. These were the biggest disappointment. Why? Flavour (or should I say, flavor). There was none. Seriously. I ended up lumping some salsa and drizzling some lime juice from my chips\'n\'salsa on to the fish tacos to "brighten them up". \n\nTotal bill for this (2 beers, starter salad and main tacos) was $49 before tip. So this is the reason I\'m rating this a two star in the review. Meh indeed! At $30 all-in it would have been disappointing but kinda ok from value-for-money point of view. At $50 plus a $10 tip (service was good, so 20% seemed appropriate) it\'s a rip. \n\nNot going again until something changes.', 'business_id': 'UVBElUlajafZDSiBK2pltw', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2013-01-11', 'type': 'review'}

Most parties were 21+ or booked. And as anal as we are about making plans and itineraries and reservations we chose to fly by the seat of our pants on this one. \n\nSo around rolls game day and we were going to head to another spot but apparently we were too late. We\'d walked past Diego a few times and had wanted to try it for lunch so we gave them a call. "Sure, we\'ll hold a table, when will you be here!" The daddy long legs of our crew shaved about seven minutes off what it should\'ve taken us if we hustled so with about three minutes to spare we called back and they agreed to hold it longer. \n\nFor last minute arrivals we were welcomed and given primo seating in a semi-private area with a big screen. Dana quickly came over to get the drinks flowing and orders started and took very good care of us. \n\nThe regular margaritas were great and I usually only drink beer and wine. They were well-balanced and smooth. I tried a strawberry pineapple one later on but it was far too sweet for me. The beer list is no great shakes but they have what you\'ll usually find at a Mexican restaurant so that works. \n\nStarting with the chips and salsa and guacamole we were immediately impressed. Best salsa and guacamole. Like, wow. I can\'t believe we didn\'t just fill up on that. \n\nWe had Taquitos with steak that were excellent. Nicely spiced, not just overdone with cumin or adobo. Also, they left no trace of that scary orange grease that\'s a by-product of bad Mexican restaurant food. They were crisp and surprisingly light - really good. The nachos were also fantastic - a good amount of toppings layered throughout instead of just sitting on top leaving naked hot, dry chips underneath. Also, much to my surprise and happiness, not a single chip was burned. Yay!\n\nDiego isn\'t top of the line cuisine, especially not compared to the major names of chefs that have restaurants in the city, but it is a great place for simpler, cheaper fare and fantastic, fun servers.', 'business_id': 'UVBElUlajafZDSiBK2pltw', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2013-02-21', 'type': 'review'}

I recall loving the guacamole and not being overly impressed with the entrees.  We also split a pitcher of margaritas between the 5 or 6 of us which made the hefty pitcher price worth the cost.\n\nSo this time, we decided to hit up Diego for their happy hour.  It was a very good experience in all.  You can only do happy hour at the bar/patio area which was fine and the price cut only affects drinks not food which would normally be a strike for me, but we had a huge breakfast so we only wanted little nibbles.\n\nI can\'t remember our server\'s name but she was friendly and greeted us quickly with chips and salsa.  Their chips have a light seasoning which is zesty as is their slightly tangy but yummy salsa.  We each ordered a strawberry-pineapple margarita (only $5 for a drink in Vegas is almost unheard of) and those margies were super delicious!\n\nWe both knew we wanted guac (I love the use of sundried tomatoes) and our server listed all the things they put into the guac and asked for our spicy preference which is awesome.  As someone who works in the food industry, I know the pains of finding out someone at your table is allergic to something or can\'t have gluten and then they have to change the order because you didn\'t think to ask.  A+ for that server!  She brought the guac and even waited for us to taste it to make sure it was spicy enough for us.\n\nMy bf ordered chicken tamales which came with spanish rice and refried beans.  I ordered the "Caesar" salad.  The food came and the server had forgotten to keep the meat off my salad (I\'m a vegetarian) and she was very apologetic.  Again, I\'m fairly lenient with servers, having been one myself plenty of times so I understand the mistake of hitting the wrong button.\n\nMy salad was just ok and I was glad that I wasn\'t that hungry and had mostly filled up on guacamole, confirming my intuition to skip the entree.', 'business_id': 'UVBElUlajafZDSiBK2pltw', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2013-02-23', 'type': 'review'}

I had one chip worth, and pushed it away so I wouldn't have to think about it. Probably the worst salsa I have ever had. And I've had the salsa at Chili's. But that was saved by the table side guac, which was made nice and citrus-y, with serrano chiles, tomato, and no onion, per my request. Tasted very good, and I like their chips, which are the right amount of salty, with almost a sweet taste to the chip itself.\n\nI can't turn down ceviche, so the bay scallop with grapefruit, mango, and habanero was next on this list. And this was really very good. Nice big helping, great citrus flavor, plenty of heat, and sweet, tender scallops. Absolutely worth getting again.

The interesting thing about this is that my wife and I have never been guacamole fans but now we are.  The carne asada with mole was the star of our order.

I'm so used to the little hole in the wall Mexican restaurants with decore exploding of pink, green and yellow and mariachi singers galore that this was a welcome change, with it's red and silver modern decor. I'm not big on fancy Mexican, because to me, authentic is always those whole in the walls or street vendors and you never spend more than $10 to be stuffed, but Diego far surpassed my expectations.\n\nI met some friends staying at MGM for dinner and they picked this place for dinner.  I ordered the carnitas enchiladas and my friend ordered the Diego special.  I can't remember what my other friend ordered...tacos?  Anyway, we also ordered table-side guac.  I had a margarita on the rocks and my friend had a mojito.  \n\nThe table-side guac was SOOO good.  My only complaint was it was a very small serving and barely enough for 3 people.  My enchiladas were good, it could have used a little more sauce.  Also, I don't usually eat the beans and rice, but they were really good when I tried a bite so by the time I was done eating, my plate was nearly clean.  My margarita was also pretty perfect.  The food presentations were on point as well. Again, my only complaint was that the portions are pretty small.\n\nThe restaurant was pretty empty so quick service was not an issue.  Our server was friendly and fast and we never had to wait to get waters refilled.  Overall, a great experience and I'd go back if I had friends staying at MGM craving some Mexican.", 'business_id': 'UVBElUlajafZDSiBK2pltw', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2013-07-11', 'type': 'review'}

When it comes to Mexican food, I'd rather have something a bit less fancy.\n\nWe had just come back from the ACM Awards show in the MGM, were starving,  wanting Mexican food, dressed up fancy, and this was right in front of us. So we went and it was ok. It looked nice inside, but the lights were so dim I could barely see my food in front of me. \n\nFood was also a bit meh. My friend and I split an enchilada entree, ordered a guacamole appetizer, two drinks (Margarita & a Michelada), and it came out to $65. Ouch. The enchiladas were fine, but I've had better for a lot less moolah. However, I would definitely come back just for the guac! Made right in front of you (entertainment value) and probably one of the most delicious I've ever had. So I guess it evened out with the enchiladas.\n\nOverall, ok place. The drinks were strong (unless it was just the lack of food & sleep?) and service was super friendly. I'd skip it next trip, unless I was craving some mighty fine guacamole.", 'business_id': 'UVBElUlajafZDSiBK2pltw', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2013-07-19', 'type': 'review'}

After scouring the restaurant area for places to grab a relatively inexpensive meal, we chose to go Mexican.\n\nBoth times we ate in the bar lounge area which is this cozy room decorated with these big, unoffensively pink tiles, a wall fountain, and a floor to ceiling shelf full of the devil\'s elixir - tequila!\n\nThe service was super friendly.  During our second visit, I had to give props to our server who was doing his best to convince us to try sipping tequila.  There was the slight possibility of doing shots preceded by a few "never again" stories.  That prompted our server to go into his sales pitch about the joys of reposado tequilas, however, no one was really mentally or financially ready to take the tequila drinking to the sipping level.\n\nWe opted for pitchers of the house margarita both times, the second time being with strawberry flavored one as touted to us by the Herradura girl who had giving us free samplings of it.\n\nOn to food, Diego\'s serves up a tasty guacamole that seems to be fresh-made.  Their chipotle wings are a-may-zing.  I don\'t even really know what makes chipotle chipotle but if it\'s supposed to be sweet and yummy, I like it...a lot.  I ordered those off of the happy hour menu on the first day, and on the second day I had their steak caesar salad. \n\nThe salad was light in that they didn\'t drown the lettuce in the dressing, however, I could barely make out the flavor of the dressing.  So I couldn\'t tell if it was "Mexican-ized", traditional, or if it was just plain bland.\n\nTheir chips were okay, nothing memorable.  They were addicting only because they were in front of my face, but when I go to Border Grill at Mandalay, when I\'m with people, we usually tear up basket after basket after basket.  The salsa was just okay as well.  No kick and nothing special but not offensive.\n\nI mostly loved the atmosphere and that it was a chill place to be out of the crowds of people.  It didn\'t hurt that they have an exceptional coconut flan, with a nice, creamy texture, served in a pool of melted sugar.  The happy hour prices and food choices are decent (for the strip).  I\'d check this place out again if I ever find myself at the MGM Grand in the future.', 'business_id': 'UVBElUlajafZDSiBK2pltw', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2013-08-11', 'type': 'review'}

The salsa was smoky and had some heat that sneaks up on you. \n\nChicken empanadas for a starter; tasty, moist chicken on a bed of guacamole. Not a huge portion, so you may want to get multiple apps if you're really hungry. \n\nChili Colorado and Pollo Mole for dinner, both were prepared and presented nicely, and no complaints about the flavors, but like everything on the menu they're things I can get just about anywhere. \n\nWe shared a pitcher of sangria, which was excellent, and we skipped dessert. \n\nThere aren't too many great Mexican places in Vegas, so it's a bit of a shame to see this place get right to edge of being great and not quite get there. \n\nPS: three stars to me is a good restaurant.", 'business_id': 'UVBElUlajafZDSiBK2pltw', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2013-08-31', 'type': 'review'}
