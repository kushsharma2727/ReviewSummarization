First of all, there is very little quality Indian food in the Phoenix metro, so that alone sets it apart. On top of that, its appeal is radically different from what I experienced around SF. This place is clean and cool, with sleek decor and comfortable booths to boot. The naan was fantastique, and the food was almost as good, but not quite. The richness and abundance of flavors weren't quite as present as with their slightly grosser counterparts in Cali. \n\nNot cheap, but, then again, hard to come by.

And, while I like the place, my husband absolutely loves it, especially their lamb dishes.\nAlso, I have to admit, I'm emotionally attached to this place as my husband and I had the rehearsal dinner for our wedding here last October. They were able to pull it together for us with only a few weeks notice (our other selection had flaked out on us at the last minute). They were really accommodating when we were running late that night, and even started bringing out appetizers to our guests who got there before us (it was supposed to be a buffet, but they were thoughtful enough to improvise).

Hayden Rd. in Scottsdale\n\nIndian Cuisine is my nose, mouth and eye\'s favorite food.  Although my stomach sometimes would disagree mildly.  But I don\'t care!  It\'s worth it!  \nUpon entering Tandoori Times, located next to the brand new "Forbidden" night  club on 5th avenue in Old Town, Scottsdale, I notice what I like to call an Honesty Kitchen.  (The first thing I noticed, was the familiar fragrances one always smells upon entering and Indian Restaurant).  I have never seen an Honesty Kitchen in an Indian Restaurant.  It was Amazing!  Not only can you watch the chef\'s skewering the meats and vegetables on the long spikes and placing them into the enormous tandoor ovens, you can also see them do little dances as they cook.  I enjoyed watching them just a bit more than the belly Dancer (on busier nights), although she was just darling.  I avoided her whenever possible.\nBack to the food- You can find the usual fare of  Naan, Tandoori, masalas, chutney as well as a bevy of vegetarian favorites.  Each time I have been into the restaurant i was met by the gracious owner, Sonny, who has greeted me kindly.  His friendly and surprisingly knowledgeable staff are equally welcoming.  The patio is roomy but last I checked, needed some attention.\nI would probably not dine here then go to Forbidden for all  night dancing, but that\'s just me.  Instead, I would recommend the opposite.  You may not find what you want at the Clubs, but you will find it at Tandoori Times.', 'business_id': 'V9i9LnTg9H2XvzqCVBSOXg', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2008-01-10', 'type': 'review'}

What Indian Restaurant doesn\'t do a lunch buffet!?\n\nWell two to be in exact, which happens to be the only two Indian restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale (Tandoori Times and Jewel of the Crown) which is where I work, of course.\n\nThe cuisine...\n\nFirst off, I\'m a big believer that you can judge an Indian restaurant by their chicken tikka masala, so since this was my first visit to Tandoori, I had to try it.   Let\'s just say it was okay at best.  The tikka masala was little bit spicier than usual, which is fine with me, and it also had the right consistency and richness from the cream you expect, but it missed the slight sweetness that contrasts the spices from the sauce.  Disappointing.\n\nNext was the naan.\n\nThe naan came out warm and had that ever so slight crispy outside that I adore, but the inside was slightly doughy or little too moist, which made the naan slightly chewy after it cooled off.  It was still good, but come on; you can at least master the basics right?\n\nWrong.\n\nLet\'s go to the rice.  First and foremost I don\'t ever recall where you had to pay for rice at any Indian restaurant.  Well guess what?  I did.  $2.50 to be exact!!!  And for $2.50, did they master this staple side dish?  Noooo...\n\nIt wasn\'t like it was horrible but I have never had Indian rice that was oily; it was slight, but you could taste and feel it.  Overall texture and flavor was sub par, but I couldn\'t get over the slightly oily taste and texture.  All I could think was that I was eating Chinese fried rice (b/c of the oiliness) with my tikka masala.  Sigh... Oh well.  Atleast they gave a hearty portion.\n\nDecor was adequate, dark green and red colored sheer covered sections of walls and was used a divider to break up the room.  But what was up with the standard white office acoustical tiles in the ceiling?  Atleast black it out like most restaurants.  I felt like I was at work or in some weird episode of The Office.  An episode when Steve Carell\'s character, Michael, decides to go to an Indian restaurant at lunch and notices the same thing...but to only make an erroneous comment out loud so everyone in the restaurant could here, starts mocking Indians and their accent and everything then goes down hill: something I would only laugh if on TV, but would not in real life.  I couldn\'t get over the fact that on top of that they had the audacity to then painted random acoustical tiles dark red and blue, which made your eyes look up at the ceiling.  I\'m clueless on that one.\n\nAnyways, I am very hard pressed to find a reason to go back Tandoori Times.  For all you Phoenicians you never had Indian Food, save your taste buds and go to NYC or anywhere back east and try it there.  But if you get the urge, I would suggest go to India Delhi Palace on McDowell Road.  The food is actually pretty good, for AZ standards that is.\n\nMore along the lines of 2 1/2 Stars', 'business_id': 'V9i9LnTg9H2XvzqCVBSOXg', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2008-01-23', 'type': 'review'}

We got the whole wheat, which soaked up the yummy goodness of the sauce that came with my lamb masala.  This dish was just spicy enough, very flavorful, and the lamb was super tender.  My friend is a veggie and got the dal makhani, which my carnivorous self actually found quite tasty.  And to top it all off, they had some chai tea that was out of this world.

Definitely not bad or awful, but maybe if I sandwiched a later supper  between undulating bare bellied vixens and a couple of Kingfishers, I'd stumble out with a hazier (and happier ) overall impression.  \n\nNothing I've ever eaten here was truly bad enough to take back - or savory enough to inspire a return visit. Portions tend to be small and sauces are, by and large, mild and rather one dimensional.  Other than the garlic naan, I cant  remember a dish smelling really awesome as it wafted by, which is a shame considering Indian cuisine is among the world's most aromatic.   \n\nI was eager to share yesterday's lamb boti kabob, as the portion was good sized - about 15-20 small cubes of lamb (not mega kabob sized cubes, but a very respectable portion for $10-11), on the usual tandoori bed of onions and peppers.  The lamb exterior was nice & crusty, but the inside wasnt moist and tender like you'd expect from tandoori - instead it was hard, chewy and disappointing.  Companion's entree was 3 tiny vegetable fritters or dumplings buried in a thick sauce, that looked more like an appetizer.  Chicken dishes are generally better - the tandoori version is good, and similar to most Indian joints.  I recommend the three hot relishes (red sauce, green puree, and pickled peppers) provided tableside, as house preparations, at least in my experience, tend to be mild. \n\nServers are generally Anglo, pleasant and competent during the meal, but just about every time we walk in for dinner at 5 or 5:30, the entire operation seems almost startled by our presence. Nobody's overtly rude, but instead of a really warm welcome, you kind of get four or five employees hanging out at the bar staring at you, as if mentally choosing straws to see who has to deal with the first dinner customer of the evening. It's not oppressive, but it's happened more than once and I'm not crazy about the vibe.  \n\nI do like the complimentary, self serve chai tea and open kitchen, providing an opportunity to stretch one's legs and socialize a bit. Nice touches.   The menu is extensive, all told about sixty items, and reasonably priced for Indian food. Indian textiles, jewelry and artwork is often on display, for sale, and the house music is too loud if you have the misfortune to be seated under a ceiling speaker. It got turned down, eventually, but any restaurant with a few years under it's belt ought to understand customary American tolerances better than that.  \n\nThe atmosphere is up and down. Food's OK. Service is OK. Ask my family and they'll each give it four or five stars.

Service can be abysmal as long as the food is good.  Tandoori Times has changed my beliefs about this, and I now realize that service can be so amazingly terrible that it can completely ruin a dining experience.\n\nDinner started innocently enough.  We sat at a table not far from the bar, and our server started out asking us what we\'d like to drink.  The server had a young kid with her, maybe 5-6 years old, and the kid was helping her with things.  I thought it was kind of strange, but I assumed it was probably our server\'s kid and that she couldn\'t find a babysitter for the night or something - no big deal.\n\nI ordered a dirty martini, and our server went back to the bar to mix our drinks (she told us the bartender had already gone home for the night, even though it was only 6PM).  Since our table was near the bar, we could hear what was going on there, and within a minute or two, I heard the server asking the rest of the staff if they knew where the olive juice was.  After a minute or two of searching, the staff concluded that they were out of olive juice.  At this point, I expected our server to come back and ask if she could get me a different drink.  She didn\'t.  Instead, she started asking the staff what she could substitute for olive juice, and they concluded that saltwater would be good.  Ugh.  She brought me the drink and pretended it was completely normal and nothing was wrong.  I pretended I didn\'t know any better, took a sip of the drink, and told her it was beyond awful and it tasted like they had used salt instead of olive juice.  She acted like she couldn\'t imagine why this was, and she said that she would take the drink off of my bill.  When she picked the drink up from the table to take it away, the young kid I mentioned earlier bumped into her and knocked the drink out of her hand.  She spilled a bit of it on me, and most of it on the floor.  She then walked away and offered no help of any kind - no napkins or anything.  This spilled drink stayed on the floor _the entire rest of the meal_, and they never cleaned it up.  When we eventually left, I was tempted to "slip" on it, pretend I severely hurt myself, and start yelling about how careless their staff was, how they could be held liable for injuries, blah blah blah.  I just wanted someone to recognize that it was ridiculous for them to not clean up things that they had spilled, but it really seemed like they didn\'t care at all.\n\nAnyway, the server asked if I wanted something else to drink instead.  I went for a gin and tonic.  When she got back to the bar, the first thing I heard was "What\'s in a gin and tonic? How do I make one?" Sigh.  Anyway, the gin and tonic turned out okay, all things considered, but at this point I was pretty sad from what had already happened.\n\nFinally, we got to ordering our food.  Our server came over, asked what we\'d like, and as we started telling her, we noticed she wasn\'t paying any attention.  She was just watching her kid and talking to her.  So, we got to repeat our order again, and this time she actually paid attention and wrote it down.  Yay.\n\nAwhile later, our food came out - we got two naans (one paneer, one chicken), chicken tikka masala, palak paneer, and rice.  The naans were pretty average, nothing really special.  The chicken tikka masala was actually pretty good, and was the only decent part of the whole meal.  The palak paneer was some of the worst I\'ve ever had, and I\'m pretty sure they just emptied a defrosted bag of frozen spinach over some cubes of paneer.  It tasted like no spices or any kind of flavoring had been added.\n\nIn the middle of eating, we were interrupted by the server and her kid for a rather awkward moment.  The server made her kid apologize for knocking over my drink, and then they walked away.  Congratulations Tandoori Times on making our dinner that much more uncomfortable.\n\nOur server didn\'t seem to care about anything throughout the whole meal - she never asked how anything was, if we needed anything, etc. When we were done eating, she came by and dropped off the check, without removing our plates from the table or even saying a word.  We had been charged an extra $2.50 just to have rice with our entrees, which I think is pretty ridiculous.  Anyway, I took out my credit card and she came by to pick it up, again without saying a word.  We left quickly, wanting to get our Tandoori Times experience over with as soon as possible.\n\nWhen we left, I was pretty frustrated and angry, which is not how one should feel when leaving a restaurant.  I will never, ever, ever come back here again.', 'business_id': 'V9i9LnTg9H2XvzqCVBSOXg', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2008-08-31', 'type': 'review'}

You would make it trendy inside. You would offer a nice bar. You would hire American people as your servers. And you would make the food not so spicy. In essence, you would create the PF Chang's of Indian Food. You would give it an Indian sounding name like Tandoori TImes and remove any vestiges of Pakistan as Indian restaurants are better recognized and thus seen as a safer option among the mainstream.  Well, that's exactly what Tandoor Times is. \n\nBeing Indian, I prefer Indian food meaning I like all the grilled meat items but they better be able to make quality sabjis and vegetarian dishes too.  Tandoori Times is a Pakastani restaurant; it's not an Indian restaurant. It's almost the same but their dishes are different. Pakastani cuisine involves Tandoori items and grilled items. Their cooking style is less spicy and offers less cream in their dishes.  Indian (Punjani/North Indian) food involves Tandoor items as well in addition to vegetable dishes, more variety and types of curries and is spicier and more flavorful in general. If you are a non-vegetarian like myself, you can survive on the curries and the shish kebob and other meat items. However, when you taste their chaat, deserts and vegetarian sabjis, this restaurant clearly does not know what they are doing.  If you are vegetarian of Indian descent, you will be sorely disappointed.  Nothing against Pakastani cuisine but vegetarian dishes are not your forte much like curries and grilled options are not really a part of South Indian cooking.  \n\nThe food is on the mild side. Of course, if you ask them to make something hotter, they can but their food in general is not very spicy and is bland with the exception of some of their curries.  If you are a Non-Indian and you want to try Indian food for the first time, this would be a good place to start. If you are someone who has eaten quality Indian food and wants the real thing, avoid this place because this is as far from being the real thing as possible. \n\nThe service and ambience was quite nice. I think that's the real draw of this restaurant since most Indian restaurants have poor service and often a dirty or claustrophobic environment.  This is a trendy restaurant in old town Scottsdale that you could take a date to.  The service was good when we went there but at the same time the servers were pretty ignorant of the menu and didn't know a lot about Indian food.\n\nBeing Indian, this place was just a bunch of hype.  Yes, it was neat to see friendly American people serving Indian food since I'm used to Indian waiters who are abrupt and to the point.  I liked the ambience but the food was disappointing. Their palak paneer honestly tasted as if some non-Indian person decided to try and make it from a cookbook at home. It was not spicy nor was it cooked properly. Their malai kofta was not even malai kofta....let's put it that way.  I will say this, their Tandoori chicke was probably the best I've had in the valley and that's not suprising since Pakastani cooking involves meat and they know how to grill meat well but outside of their meat dishes, it was completely lackluster. \n\nThe bottom line is that if you are an Indian person or a person who is used to eating quality Indian food and you want honest to goodness quality INDIAN (not Pakastani) food, avoid this place.  If you are a non-Indian person wanting to check out Indian/Pakastani food and just want to have a good time, this place is for you.  Note, however that the prices are rather high for an Indian/Pakastani restaurant so you are paying for that ambience.", 'business_id': 'V9i9LnTg9H2XvzqCVBSOXg', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2008-10-13', 'type': 'review'}

Coming from a native, I hope this means something!\n\nAnother restaurant close to my hotel so I decided to try it out on my way back (ate at My Big Fat Greek Restaurant last night) to the room. Seating confused me at first because the sign said seat yourself but there was also a host directing people to tables. Whatever...\n\nPretty extensive menu. I ordered the beef seekh kabab wrap and the butter chicken with rice and a plain naan. Kind of annoying that none of the curries come with rice or naan (and rice is 2.50, 1.75 for a plain naan). Luckily I was on the expense account so I didn't care about the cost too much. Food took a while to come out, but there was also a large party ahead of me which got served first. The kabab wrap consisted of a monster thick kabab, nothing wimpy like some other restaurants to with the usual accompaniments. \n\nThe butter chicken was thick and creamy and the serving dish was filled to the brim (almost overflowing). There was a decent amount of chicken in there, definitely not skimpy like many other restaurants. It tasted delicious and no one seasoning was overpowering. The portion was pretty big and between the kabab wrap and the butter chicken, two people could easy have eaten and been satisfied. \n\nOverall delicious food and pretty good service. They don't really have a full bar (as they advertise), there are maybe 10 spirits with a few mixers, and beer. I didn't imbibe, but the selection was pretty standard fare (rum, scotch, tequila, vodka) and looked decently priced (at least according to the drink menu).", 'business_id': 'V9i9LnTg9H2XvzqCVBSOXg', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2008-10-29', 'type': 'review'}

We just usually don't do dinner out on V-Day.  Not that we have anything against the big day, but my idea of a romantic dinner out does not involve 50 other couples having their special dinner at the same time.  Anywho, fondue was the plan, but I neglected to buy anything to dip into the imaginary cheese I also failed to buy.\n\nWe settled on Tandoori as neither of us had been there, just down the street from home, and we didn't expect it to be a major Valentine's destination.  I was pleasantly surprised they were offering a complimentary rose for the ladies.  Complimentary, as in free.  No dude peddling his roses to unsuspecting men who may have previously neglected the flower ritual and know they are damned if they do (like a $5 rose is going to make up for screwing up the flower thing) and damned if they don't (he's so cheap, he couldn't even buy me a stinkin' $5 rose).  Nice touch, no pressure, woman happy, all is well.\n\nWe started with the bread basket which had to be a concoction of Robert Atkins' evil twin.  It had four kinds of Naan (plain, onion, garlic, and potato).  We ate all we could and then some and still had leftovers.  I had the chicken makhani which is a tomato based curry with herbs and spices.    Perhaps a little too spicy if you can't tolerate any heat, but for me it was perfect.  My husband had the lamb vindaloo.  I tried it and it was a little too hot for me, but it was pretty damn good I must say.\n\nWe found our server to be pleasant and attentive.  I'm sorry we didn't go sooner (actually we tried, but they close between lunch and dinner) as they are moving their Scottsdale location to Hayden & Via de Ventura.  Somehow I think we'll make the extra effort to go again.

Witnesses claim the group was laughing loudly at times.  One bystander reported, "That was a guffaw.  That outburst right there was definitely a guffaw.  Wild stuff."\n\n    Sources have related to this publication that the group dined on two appetizers, one known as a bread basket which consisted of four types of naan bread.  Jim W was overheard to say, "I really like the onion naan."  The other appetizer may have been Aloo Tikki.  This has not been confirmed as yet.  In any case the plate containing the reported Aloo Tikki was cleaned by the foursome, several even going so far as to swab at the remaining sauce on the plate.\n\n    The above sources also reported that the table was served an order of the Friday daily special of Kahari Shrimp.  It was overheard by a nearby table that the shrimp was "...flavorful with strong notes of garlic and ginger."  This has not substantiated, however.\n\n    Audrey W reportedly was served the Lamb Korma which she was rumored to have noted was "Yummy."\n\n    Carin S apparently was served the Chicken Masala and Donald S may have been served some sort of Vindaloo that included potato.  It seems there was considerable sharing of the dishes around the table and the main dishes may have been spooned over what some experts have suggested was a basmati rice with various herbs and spices.\n\n    An unnamed source has informed this publication that while Jim W claims to have particularly enjoyed the food and festive atmosphere which included a belly dancer and some swordplay, he was displeased with the excessive sound level produced by the in-house sound system and even requested that the music be reduced.\n\n    Jim W\'s blog had a statement this morning that read, in part; "...ears haven\'t hurt the next morning like that since my last rock concert.  I really liked the food but I wouldn\'t go back on a night when they have dancing again."', 'business_id': 'V9i9LnTg9H2XvzqCVBSOXg', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2009-05-09', 'type': 'review'}

A quick U-Turn, brake check, sharp right, up a ramp and into a parking place. That complex is like a maze and I feel lucky that I located my destination.\n\nWalked in the yelp stickered door and was hit with that delicious Indian restaurant smell. What was lacking was the scent of mesquite which you can usually pick up at most places from the tandoor. This was an upclass place so I figured it was just vented well. The place was really cool on the inside having this upscale lounge type feel. Nice and dim and easy on the eyes.\n\nThe guy who was double duty as host/waiter seemed a bit annoyed that I was walking in the door at 8:45 when they were open until 10. A tad on the snooty side asked if I was picking up or eating in with a heavy insinuation that I better be picking up. Luckily I was saved by my phone going off as my friend couldn't find the place. I got to bark two for dinner and walked out the door to find my friend.\n\nWas happy when our waitress came to the table since I didn't want much to do with the host. She took our drink order and asked if we needed a few more minutes to which I made the mistake of replying yes. Normally I have these meals pre planned and know exactly what I want but this was a last minute change of destination. I regretted not ordering right then because we didn't see her again for a long while.\n\nMy friends have learned that I usually know what's good and just let me order for the table. One of them was an appetizer and as usual I was asked if I wanted that first or with the meal. I try and condense the time that I'm eating bad food to limit the sugar spikes it might create. I'm not even sure why they ask because 9 out of 10 times they bring it first anyway :( this was one of those 9 times. \n\nWe waited for what seemed like an eternity for this one dish to show up. At that point I just started eating because I was super hungry. The rest took another 15 minutes to get there. Kitchen here is REALLLLY slow and we were one of only 3 tables.\n\nOne more note.. do yourself a favor and get a table. The booths here are horrible. They press you forward into the table and are very uncomfortable on the back after a while.. and you will be there a while :P\n\nFood Details:\n\nOnion Bhaji:\nI ordered these thinking they were something different. They were basically battered onion strings with what I would guess was a plum based sauce. I was expecting the Indian fritters that I couldn't remember the name of at the time. It was still tasty.\n\nBread Basket:\nSampler of 5 different types of Naan. The only ones I would recommend are the onion and garlic. In the rest the texture was a little different but no flavor profile change and rather dull.\n\nChicken Tikka Masala:\nMmmm I love this dish and it was pretty darn good here. I have had better but it wasn't in the valley. I haven't chowed on much Indian since returning here many years ago.\n\nSaag Paneer:\nTexturally this was way off from what I'm used to. It was almost like a ground spinach. The spice profile of the dish was excellent but I was a little disappointed in the Paneer. This isn't a strong cheese anyway but this really had no flavor to it. I'm used to it adding at least a creamy/richness to the dish. This one had the taste/texture of firm tofu.\n\nTandoori Chicken:\nI was REALLY craving some tandoori chicken and I was disappointed. It wasn't bad but it lacked the bold flavor depth this dish usually has. I also totally missed any mesquite/wood/smoke flavor that should have been there. Between the lack of wood taste and smell I think this place may use a gas driven Tandoori verses a real mesquite charcoal version.\n\nKheer:\nRice pudding is great stuff and adding almonds and raisins to it... yum. This is where someone played a cruel joke on us. The dessert glass was an odd shape and the spoon didn't fit all the way! If you wanted to retain your manners there was 1/4 of the dessert you were unable to reach. Manners were tossed out the window :)\n\n\nI agree fully with the 3 stars this place has averaged for itself. I made the mistake of trusting some friends over trusting yelp. I could have done much better that night but this was A-OK and tamed the craving. We felt very rushed towards the end of the dinner to pay and get a move on. We were there in plenty of time to eat and leave before closing had this place operated at a normal pace.\n\nJust remember.. if your friends had good taste.. they would be yelpers :)", 'business_id': 'V9i9LnTg9H2XvzqCVBSOXg', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2010-03-22', 'type': 'review'}

I was even more encouraged when I walked in and found an almost exclusively Indian (appearing) clientele.  To begin, the service was a little off.  There was maybe 10 people in the restaurant yet we waited a full five minutes or so for a greeting.  When he did come by, he asked if we were ready to order and I looked at him and said, "You know, we might need to look at the menus first."  Perhaps he\'s used to "regulars."  Anyway, we began with the Onion Bhaji, essentially an Indian version of onion rings, and Raita, a cucumber, potato, mint and yogurt sauce.  The Onion Bhaji looked good in all its fried glory, but was so heavily battered my wife and I both felt ill after trying a few pieces.  You could not taste the onion at all.  Major disaster.  The waiter began to redeem himself by noticing that we had hardly touched it and offered to take it off the menu.  The Raita was fresh and flavorful but didn\'t exactly fit with anything we ordered and a recommendation of what to eat it with would have been helpful.  We also ordered the Naan and simply put it was killer---hot, light, wonderful.  First score at Tandoori TImes.  My wife ordered the Chicken Makhani and one sampling of the sauce had us both oohing and ahhing at its rich, buttery flavor.  Nothing to say here again but killer.  I ordered the Lamb Korma, and though I found the dish to be decent, it was just very plain when compared to other Indian dishes I have had that just burst with varied bold flavors.  I also asked that it come spicy (6 out of 10) but instead it came with NO spice at all, while my wife\'s dish came pretty hot and was supposed to be mild.  I wouldn\'t order again but it may be right up someone else\'s alley.  FInally, we ordered a plate of rice to accompany our meals.  The rice looked and tasted like it had been sitting around since yesterday (and maybe it was!).  My wife grew up on rice and loves it more than she loves me, so when she frowns at the sight and scowls at the taste of the rice, it is bad rice.  I could justify giving Tandoori Times less than three stars but something tells me another visit may render us happier customers.  I\'ll try it again, but only one more time before I chalk it up to "just another Indian place" where the food and service simply fall short.', 'business_id': 'V9i9LnTg9H2XvzqCVBSOXg', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2010-05-20', 'type': 'review'}

I can\'t in good conscience give it a 5 star rating because I know of better places in CA, but - on a scale of \'Phoenix area\' Indian places, this would get a 5 star rating no problem. \n\nI\'ve been looking for a good Indian place for over a year, and I saw this place over a year ago, but decided it was too \'fancy\', and could not rationalize a good Indian place in such an upscale, suburban setting. So I kept passing it up.   In the meantime, I\'ve been to Mesa, Tempe, and Chandler in search of the solution, Most times, I don\'t even walk in the door ... I\'m sorry, but - as a lone diner, I\'m not interested in being the only patron at 7pm, plus what does that tell you about the food if no one is there?  \n\nI walked into TT at 7:30pm on a Friday night and it was busy!  That was a big plus.  And most of the patrons looked Indian - another big plus. For some reason I\'d gotten it into my head that this was a fancy spot, but in fact, the interior is simply \'nicely done\'.  Head and shoulders above most Indian places for sure, but - definitely not stuffy or over-fancy.  \n\nMany people have mentioned the incredibly slow service.  My waiter is maybe a yelp reader, because he told me - "these Tandoori appetizers shouldn\'t be called appetizers, they should say, \'20-30 minutes to cook\'".  He suggested I get my tandoori appetizer at the same time as my main dish - good advice. I had the goat curry, which was outstanding, and the tandoori lamb chops - which was not perfect - way more pieces than I imagined, but thinly sliced, and not as juicy as I had hoped.  The rice was absolutely perfect - basmati rice with some whole cloves dotted throughout. The naan bread was also perfect - really, really perfect, and made the meal a perfect treat. \n\nJust as my meal arrived ... boom ... the music got loud and out jumped ... a belly dancer!  This was NOT what I was in the mood for, and at first I felt the evening was ruined ... but - she was good, and really \'worked the crowd\' as it were, and made an effort to engage everyone. Some tables got up and danced with her, leading to a rather festive atmosphere. Overall, a plus, but I\'m glad it was only one reasonably short session. \n\nIn summary - good food, nice place, nice atmosphere, and head-and-shoulders above anything else I\'ve found in the Phoenix metro so far (eastern edge - I don\'t get over to the west).', 'business_id': 'V9i9LnTg9H2XvzqCVBSOXg', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2010-07-04', 'type': 'review'}

It was good but I don't like one of the spices in the garbanzo beans, The Aloo Tikki last week in West Palm, Fla, was infinitely better. I had chicken korma which again had that taste I am not too keen on, similar to nutmeg or cloves, which I have not noticed in any korma I have ever had previously. The korma sauce was very thick and I liked it but it was much thicker than the usual korma sauce in most other places and although it was good and certainly quite different, I think I prefer the usual consistency. But it is nice to have something different for a change. The onion naan was possibly a little underdone and slightly doughy, though it too was good and i suspect it was not so much underdone as that this is the way it is served at this restaurant. What was over was taken home and certainly thoroughly enjoyed the next day so it's fair to say I would recommend this restaurant. \n\nMy chief complaint would be the noise. When we walked in we were pleased to see that there were many Indian customers, always a good sign in an Indian restaurant. But it was noisy and the most noise came from a crying baby. This is not the baby's fault - I wish people with very young children would have the decency to do what I did when my kids were young... leave them at home!! Many people say that if you can't afford to leave at least a 15% - 20% tip then you can't afford to eat out. I think if you can't afford to find a babysitter so you can enjoy your evening and in particular so you can NOT spoil the evening for others, then PLEASE stay home. As usual, the people with the baby were impervious to its crying, they were obviously so accustomed to it that it does not bother them. I am not sure whether to hold this against the restaurant. they could have asked the people to take the baby outside until it settled, but it was cold outside and I wouldn't want to make them do that to the kid. It's a difficult situation for the resaurant but if I go again and the same thing happens again I will mark it down as a family restaurant and keep away when I don't want to deal with the noise of babies crying.", 'business_id': 'V9i9LnTg9H2XvzqCVBSOXg', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2010-12-27', 'type': 'review'}

My very favorite place is 18 miles away and I wanted something nearby.  I found Tandoori Times and arrived there at 8PM.  I couldn\'t believe that at 8PM there were 10 people ahead of us waiting for a table. " A good sign "I thought or "poor management that can\'t handle a crowd?"  Someone who appeared to be the owner was busy working to see that everyone got a table quickly.  We got a table in 10 minutes in a small room they have in the rear of the restaurant.  Within 5 minutes we got a waitress and placed our order.  She brought us condiments (a red spicy sauce, coriander chili sauce and a spicy sauce made with marinated ginger bits.   No papadums.  Most restaurants give you papadums.  We missed them.  My order of Chicken Vindaloo was absolutely delightful spiced just as I requested HOT.  Our double order of bread came hot and delish(we don\'t eat rice).  My husband\'s Lamb Tikka was generous and nicely done.  During our meal, the belly dancer started her act.  This meant that the loud music would soon begin.  AND I MEAN LOUD.  I don\'t know if it was that we were in that small room, but my eardrums were about to burst.  There was no relief until we ended our meal.  The belly dancer could not be seen from our room so we stood up to peek at what was going on.  It was an attractive young lady, dressing in belly dancing garb dancing to Indian pop music.  Not really belly dancing.  (I\'ve done belly dancing myself.)  Next, dessert.  I ordered the Kheer.  It was absolutely amazing.  It was creamy with sliced almonds and raisins.  Probably one of the best I\'ve had anywhere.  \nI gave Tandoori Times 4 stars because the music was too loud and it kind of spoiled the experience for us.  Other than that the food is really authentic and delicious.  I hope that the management will consider toning down the music at least for the poor people in the back room.  I would never accept a seat in that room when I return.  AND, I will return.', 'business_id': 'V9i9LnTg9H2XvzqCVBSOXg', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2011-02-05', 'type': 'review'}

I heard that Tandoori  times was a great restaurant, so my boyfriend and I decided to eat there a few weeks back. I had been looking for a new Indian restaurant and was excited to try it out. \n\n The restaurant was busy, and we waited about 5 minutes until a table was available.  We were seated on the patio behind a pillar (bad idea). Our server came over after a few minutes to take our drink order.  He came back with our drinks, and we were unsure as to what we wanted to order for dinner but we ordered the aloo tikki to start. \n\nThe appetizer took a long time to come out (about 20 minutes) and our server didn\'t come back to take our order until shortly before our appetizer arrived.  We ordered the bengun bhartha and chicken curry with garlic naan. \n\nAnother 20 or so minutes went by after we were finished with our appetizer before we saw our server again. He set our dishes down and asked if we wanted anything else. I asked if we could have a side of rice because I just guessed that he had forgotten it, or it was on its way as all Indian places I have been to serve rice as an accompaniment to dishes. \n\nI told my boyfriend I didn\'t want to eat my meal without rice, so I waited about 10 minutes.... no rice... our server continued serve other tables and walk away before my boyfriend could flag him down. Finally, I decided to not let the already mildly cool food get colder, so I reluctantly began eating. \n\nThe curry tasted great and was well spiced.  I also loved the bengun bhartha (I have only found one place that makes it the way I like it). \n\nAfter we were done eating the two dishes, the server finally came over (no rice in hand) to ask how our meal was.  My boyfriend politely asked for boxes, our rice to go (since they seemed to be still cooking it), and the check.  We waited another 5 or so minutes to get our bill, and the server says, "don\'t worry about the rice.... it\'s on me"  WHAT?? WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO PAY EXTRA FOR RICE???? \n\nMy boyfriend got up and went looking for the manager. He spoke to the hostess and found out the manager had stepped away, but she called and spoke to him. My boyfriend explained our experience, and how it was our first time dining there. The manager said that we would either wait for him to return, or the hostess could take 15% off our bill.  Not wanting to wait any longer for anything else, my boyfriend just asked for the discount. \n\nThe food was great, but the service was crap. Absolute crap. Unfortunately, due to that first impression, I don\'t want to go back.', 'business_id': 'V9i9LnTg9H2XvzqCVBSOXg', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2011-04-08', 'type': 'review'}

Each time we waited, I looked over at the bar and he was just standing around drumming his fingers.\n\nThe food was very bland. Even with a ton of heat/spice, the blandness overpowered everything.

The chicken vindaloo should have been called potato vindaloo, however.  Very little chicken was to be found.  Also, the garlic on the naan was extremely bitter.  As the naan was slightly charred, I assume the garlic had slightly burned.  The price point on both the naan and rice seemed a little high (I believe it was $2.75 for the naan and a similar amount for a small cup of rice).  Charging for rice seems overkill here.

We had baingan bharta (eggplant) which was pretty much burnt and panneer tikka masala which was normal. The breads were good (but the aloo naan was too thick in my opinion) and the veg briyani was pretty ok-ish. The lassis were not bad. While we were waiting for our food, there was a big party with a kid who was just let loose and was running from one table to another. Before we could realize what was happening, he just threw up next to us. His parents were least bothered and just wiped him up, continued eating and the kid got back to running. We were disgusted to say the least and the waiter moved us to another table. But even after they cleaned up the mess, we could smell vomit throughout the time we were there. They should have used a strong disinfectant, i strongly suspect they used only water to clean it. So anyway, we lost our appetite, ate very little, skipped dessert and took the rest of the food home.

Since there isn\'t Guyanese roti shop (that I\'m aware of) in AZ I make do with Tandoori.\n\nThe atmosphere is cozy and inviting. The staff always friendly and accommodating.

I love the fact that there are always Indians eating here, that\'s a good sign.\n\nYou wait a little longer for your food but that means it\'s fresh. It\'s not fast food so if you can\'t handle the wait, go to mc donalds. This is not a food factory. I always get the tikki masala with the Aloo naan. It\'s good and it faintly satisfies my cravings for curry with roti or dahl pouri. Tandoori\'s version of Roti is some chip thing not a west indian roti, so if you\'re looking for that get the Naan. The only thing missing was some rum haha.  The portions are very generous so if you\'re on a diet.... be prepared to slip up.\n\nPrices are great, I believe a dinner for 2 with no alcohol, is around $35, very affordable for fresh cooked food.', 'business_id': 'V9i9LnTg9H2XvzqCVBSOXg', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2012-07-08', 'type': 'review'}

You pay for rice and nan as well regardless of what you order. I did not feel like I had a $50 meal by any means and that is what 2 dishes, one "small plate," nan, rice, and one drink cost us.

The nice server said, "Now is ok", and I opened the app on my iPhone and she wrote down the number.  She handed my phone back to me, and I showed her that I was going to press the Redeemed button.  No problem!  My friend and  I ordered drinks:  a mango lassi and a diet coke.  The server brought the drinks, and my friend and I continued to make small talk and look over the menu.  Suddenly, the server and a manager were back at the table.  "There\'s a problem with the Groupon.  When we try to enter the number, it says it\'s been redeemed."  No kidding!!!  I just redeemed it in front of the server!  The server then apologized because it was her first day, and the manager kept saying, I\'m sorry.  I can\'t apply the Groupon without the Groupon being active.  Then he went on to say that I should call Groupon and have them reactivate this and not to worry because this has happened before...um...is Groupon going to take care of this right now?  I don\'t think so.  I just wanted to ask at this point...AND THIS IS YOUR CUSTOMER\'S FAULT BECAUSE....?????  So there I had pressed the redeemed button in good faith in front of the server so that she wouldn\'t get in trouble (I\'ve had people thank me at other places because they forgot to ask me to do this, so I just do it now in front of them...ease of anxiety cuz who needs THAT, right?), and I\'m now being told by the manager that we\'ll have to pay cash because he has no recourse with regard to processing the promotion.  GOOD management would have apologized for their establishment\'s mistake and then filed a claim with Groupon themselves.  but not here.  ...and the very LEAST he could have done was comp\'d our drinks!!!!

It was my second time a Tandoori Times, although this location was a new one. Its actually kind of tough to find... tucked away in a pretty large complex of businesses and restaurants.\n\nWe sat down and were greeted by a very nice waiter. We both ordered an Indian beer and asked for suggestions. He pointed a few out and we got to ordering.\n\nAppetizer was a Lamb Kabob (but they take out the stick before it is served). Just ground lamb with some saut\xe9ed onions and peppers. It was accompanied by a few sauces. It was ok but certainly nothing earth shattering.\n\nThen we ordered two entrees he recommended. One was a shrimp dish with a reddish curry. The other was chicken vindaloo. Pretty much chicken with potatoes in a yellowish curry.\n\nHe also suggested we get some nan (a flat bread) and some rice, advising the dishes were family style.\n\nHope I don\'t sound to crabby, but the portions were crap. I was expecting it to be like a Chinese restaurant where you get a good portion to share. NOPE. The shrimp dish had a whopping 6 shrimp. For $14 bucks I expected much more than that, especially after teh family style/sharing comment. If I go to a Chinese place and get spicy shrimp they bring out a proper portion. \n\nSame with the chicken. Maybe 6 or 8 chunks of chicken with a little potatoes. Same story as above. Anywhere else and I\'d get a mountain of chicken. Enough to share, right?!\n\nThe little bit of lamb was $13, plus they also charged for the nan and rice. $3 bucks each.\nAnyway, the food was definitely good, but when accompanied by a $67 bill (plus $13 tip), this was probably the smallest $80 meal I\'ve had. Both my client and I could have eaten much more if allowed.\n\nSo I guess to sum it up. Good food but not at its price point. Those things have to line up to get a glowing review from this Yelper.\n\nHighly recommend it though if price isn\'t a big concern. Can\'t wait to have to explain to my boss why I\'m expensing an $80 lunch for just me and one client at an Indian joint.', 'business_id': 'V9i9LnTg9H2XvzqCVBSOXg', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2013-08-08', 'type': 'review'}

This is my Go-To place for Indian food. Really delicious! \n\nPros- Very good food! I was a newbie to Indian food when I first came here (years and years ago) and now I feel super confident in my ability to order it. You can request what level of spiciness you'd like (scale of 1 to 5) which is nice if you're a wuss like I am! They have bellydancers on the weekends (don't make eyecontact or they will ask you to dance with them lol). The servers are usually very attentive (fill up soda's quickly, can answer questions, you know, the usual). \n\nCons- I guess my biggest gripe would be that they are forever offering a Groupon. The worst part? When I came here last I was with my aunt and she used a Groupon. NOOOOO!!!! I HATE HATE HATE Groupon and Groupon users (sorry Aunt Kris, you are of course exempt because you at least tip on the full amount). I say this with love Tandoori Times as I have been loyal to you since high school, no more Groupon!

Our beer order took over 10 minutes to come, our appetizer order took another 20 minutes.  We placed our dinner order right away when the appetizers were served in order to minimize the wait but still ended waiting about 30 minutes after we finished our appetizers. We got there at 7pm and it nearly 9pm by the time we were able to leave.  Not going back till service improves.

A little awkward.   The young woman who sat us and served us said she couldn\'t seat us in a booth which we preferred because "we might get a larger group of 6."    The restaurant was about 50 to 60% full.   About 5 minutes later, one of the other servers sat a couple with an infant in a stroller in the very booth we were eyeing.   \n\nThings went downhill from there.   We ordered some Naan, which is listed as an appetizer, along with our entrees.  About 45 minutes later, all of our order arrived, which was about 5 minutes after the booth couples\' food arrived.  Our Naan came with no sauces for dipping.  Our server checked on us about 5 to 10 minutes later and we requested the sauces.
