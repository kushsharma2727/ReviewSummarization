So I finally gave in and went for some overpriced Chinese food.  I came pretty late (like thirty minutes before closing..which I think was midnight), so I was seated very quickly.\n  \n  The atmosphere of the place is pretty cozy and chic, but without having that uber "hey look we\'re a fusion restaurant" look. The menu had a good amount of items that seemed pretty authentic. Anyway I ordered some Chinese broccoli in oyster sauce, beef chow fun, and a roasted duck noodle soup. \n\n  Service throughout the night was very quick and friendly (even though the place was pretty much closing) and the servers constantly came by to check on me...which was nice. The food on the other hand...well I don\'t know what it was...but nothing was that hot...in temperature. As if everything was cooked, but sat out for five or ten minutes before they served it to me.  As for the quality, it was somewhere between what you\'d get at a Chinese buffet and actually going to a restaurant in a decent Chinatown. As for prices...well it\'s Vegas so it\'s definitely higher than what you\'d expect from a Chinatown place (i.e. Beef Chow Fun was like $15...where as in Chinatown would be closer to $8-10). But not going to make you go broke by any means.  I think my only major beef with the place was that my hot tea was luke warm...kind of annoying.\n\n  Anyway The Noodle Shop is definitely not a place I would go out of my way for.

As for me, I remember seeing the noodle shop, and having some hot noodle soup or chow mein sounded yummy after drinking all weekend. So, our group headed over to the noodle shop.\n\nFirst off, the service is really really bad here. The service is slow, and half of the staff doesn't know what they're doing. Granted you don't get good service in a Chinese place, it was still worse than many other places. Our waiter just didn't care about anything, and never came back to ask how our food was or refill our water. On top of that, we wanted to split the bill at the end. So the way we usually do that, is write each person's last 4 digits of their credit card number and the amount they want to have charged on their card. At every restaurant, waiter's are please to see us make it so easy for them, and have it done right away. However, the staff here just couldn't figure it out. We waited a total of 20 minutes just to get our bill back. I noticed that there was about 4 people trying to handle the bill, and none of them could get it, so they finally had the manager come out. After the whopping 20 minutes, we finally got our bill back.\n\nAs for the food here, let's just say I much rather go to Panda Express for my Chinese food. I ordered chow mein, and it was soo bland and soo oily and greasy. I can't cook Chinese food for shit, and I could whip something better up.\n\nOverall, I was really disspointed since I was craving some good , or even settle for decent, Chinese food.

I was a bit disappointed in the Noodle shop.  The staff was a bit brusque and slow at times.  I felt that the service was extremely slow for an afternoon late lunch with a near empty restaurant while several staff members present.  Figured that the authentic service would be a good sign, but alas I was in for a disappointment.\n\nThe food was average chinese food that I could get in Delaware, which if you have read my posts before that is a very low bar.  I ended up getting the chicken lettuce cups as an appetizer and the Hong Kong style noodles with seafood.\n\nThe chicken filling was well made with a nice mild sweetness it.  The water chestnuts were chopped and crisp.  As a difference there was some pine nuts mixed in which was a nice crunch and flavor.  Chicken was moderate, but nothing special.  Disappointingly the dish came with only 3 leaves of lettuce for the dish, much too few.  The other problem was that they served it with ROMAINE lettuce, not much of a cup or able to wrap it up.  Poor choice of lettuce type.\n\nHong Kong style noodles were not freshly made, they were standard type thick noodles.  Not exactly pasty but pretty close.  The fish in the seafood was cold and flat tasting with a bit of gristle.  The shrimp was well seasoned and prepared but that was the only highlight of the dish.  Overall the dish was a bit oily and disappointing.\n\nWhile I understand that the food would be a bit more expensive because of the location in the casino it was way overpriced considering the quality of the food.  The dishes were of low quality compared to what I would expect at Vegas in a casino.  I avoided this place during the remainder of my trip and would not return.', 'business_id': 'a1t31qMLd5fQocEjbSJ61A', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2010-10-15', 'type': 'review'}

However, if you are looking for true Thai dishes, this is not going to meet your desires. Lots of rice and noodle dishes, which are great to cure a case of the beer (or wine, or bourbon) flu.  Since I was suffering from a strain of the Guinness-Jameson blight, I chose a hot Green Tea and the Roast Duck noodle soup. This was the perfect cure. The duck was excellent, perfectly cooked, perfectly done meat, with a little bit of fatty skin.  The broth complimented the duck perfectly.  It also had some noodles and a little veg, though I wish there were a little more of the greens added.  My wife  had the Tom Yum Thai soup. Good but not really Thai style, missing elements like the lime and the sour style that is common.  When suffering from the 'flu' it is best to have a spicy dish. The hot bean paste condiment is excellent. Nice roasted and smoky flavor. It does pack a wallop.\n\nThe price was right and the service was quick and efficient, and friendly.

Be sure you don't expect to try dessert-the check was presented with no question of any dessert or drinks-and when we queried the waitress-we were told they don't have dessert? Drinks, appetizers, entrees, rice, noodles, but no Dessert? Just plain weird.", 'business_id': 'a1t31qMLd5fQocEjbSJ61A', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2015-08-27', 'type': 'review'}

Service is bad. Porridge is okay but the meat in it is terrible. \n\nIf you're Asian and have any idea what authentic Asian food tastes like, then you won't like it here. If you think Panda Express = good Chinese food, then you might have a chance. \n\nIt's Panda-level, maybe even below...sometimes Panda is good.  Do yourself a favor and keep walking when you see the menu sitting outside. I walked by it 3 times and finally gave in. Biggest mistake of my life this week. \n\nI didn't give it a 1 star because I save that honor for places that I truly hate.
