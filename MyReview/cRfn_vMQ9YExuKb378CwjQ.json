You can visit any Harrahs property buffet as often as you like during a 24 hour period.  Note that they're not actually open 24 hours a day; actually none are open past 10pm.  Also, the Ceasars Palace dinner is dark on Tuesday and Wednesday I think, so make sure to double check on availability.\n\nHow many buffets can one indulge themselves with in a 24 hour period?  I was able to do three - Paris, Planet Hollywood, and Ceasars Palace.  A quick rundown: Paris lunch was just okay IMO, but the fact that you can get a custom made to order dessert crepe is pretty cool.  PH had the best selection for dinner.  Ceasars lunch (the following day) was probably the swankiest, but not as good as PH.  My group and I opted to skip Ballys, Harrahs, Imperial Palace, and Rio.  I wouldn't have minded checking out Rio, but it's proximity to the places we were gaming pushed it off the list.  Actually, we DID stop by Harrahs for good measure, but only to quickly walk in/out to grab cotton candy and gelato at the end of our 24 hour period..  That's right, we did it just because we could.\n\nThe Buffet of Buffets gets 5 stars because I've paid at least $35 for one buffet at Wynn in the past.  When I go to Vegas, I'm going to get at least one buffet no matter what..  I have to.  It's tradition.  If I'm going to get one, why not indulge and get two or three for the same price?\n\nOkay, gym time.", 'business_id': 'cRfn_vMQ9YExuKb378CwjQ', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2010-06-16', 'type': 'review'}

We figured if we could get 3 meals out of it, then its a good deal. But choose your buffets wisely and expect to wait on line, especially on weekends and holidays. There is a choice of 7 buffets. From what I have read, skip the Imperial Palace. This is a lower grade place and have heard it is bad. Also, skip the Flamingo and Ceasars Palace, both are mediocre at best from my experience. \n\nNow, here was out strategy. We would do a late dinner the first night, early breakfast  the next morning, and then dinner that same day. 3 buffets should be your maximum goal. Any more than that you are eating for the sake of eating and trying to "win" your money back. I don\'t want to think I am trying to beat a casino at its own game. You will never win.\n\nFor our first dinner we chose the World Buffet at the Rio. At one time this was the best buffet in Vegas. It is still decent, but it has definitely had a fall from grace in the last 6 years or so. We were here on the Sunday of labor day weekend and the wait on line was about 90min. By the time we started eating it was nearly 10pm. We felt so European. Like I said, the food was decent, the slow cooked meats were good as was the prime rib. Also, good salad bar. I would definitely go again with the BOB. But not worth the $25 base price which is what 95% of the people on line were paying. Also avoid weekends and holidays and your wait on line is more like 15min.\nFor breakfast the next day, we did Le Village buffet at the Paris. The wait on line was about 25min. Not bad for Labor Day. The food was good breakfast fare. However, the does not resemble French food at all. Basically, it was all typical American fare with French names. For example, Potatoes Lyonnaise resembled under cooked/seasoned potatoes that were stuffed into the broiler to try to finish them off. Overall a good experience with the BOB.\n\nFor our last supper on the BOB we chose the Spice Market Buffet at PH. This was out favorite. Overall, most of the food was good, but typical LV buffet food. What put it over the top for me was the Middle Eastern station. They had some freshly grilled kabobs that were absolutely delicious and the sides were great. Good hummus and baba ganoush(?). The pizza was good. Skip the sushi, so so. Would come back again and pay the $25 asking price.\n\nWould I do the BOB again. Yes! Would I follow this strategy of feasting again? For the dinners yes, maybe somewhere else for breakfast or Le Village again. Highly recommend getting the Total Rewards card first and saving the $6. This makes it about $14/meal and about the best deal on the strip.', 'business_id': 'cRfn_vMQ9YExuKb378CwjQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2010-09-08', 'type': 'review'}

We didn't even realize we were already members from back in 2005 :)  It's definitely worth the price since it pays for itself in two meals. Only problem is we got a little tired of buffets after lunch at Lago, dinner at Spice Market and lunch at Rio the next day.  I would probably get it again and just use it for two dinner buffets if you get the timing right. I've reviewed the buffets individually, but in a nutshell: Lago has terrible reviews but, although small, I loved the food quality and ambiance and would go back... Spice Market has good variety and generally good taste but is loud and feels unfriendly and smoke wafts down from the casino... and finally, Rio had some bright spots but is kinda overrated if you ask me - too big, crowded, lesser quality food, poor ambiance.

You then have 24 hours to eat as much as you want. We started out around 7 ish for dinner the first night at Planet Hollywood, hands down the best buffet in Las Vegas...they have great seafood including pre-cut, hot or cold king crab legs that were phenomenal! Then the next day we woke up later then expected and hit the Paris for lunch around 11am, which was good, fresh made crepe bar (only sweet options though) good pasta and meats, rare prime rib, roast beef, chicken and maybe some others. We then hit Caesars Palace around 6 pm for dinner, which was horrible, very very small, and just not good food. The prime rib was well done, the fish very heavily fried, the lobster bisque tasted like tomato soup, just not good, desert was just like any other buffet, cookies, pastries, etc. \n\nSo overall the buffet of buffets pass worked great, with the exception of Caesar's but apparently I should have read the reviews first and would have known, so my fault.

We then checked out the Yelp reviews of each buffet to help us narrow down. We also tried to lay out when each of our feeding times would be. We also considered doing exit interviews outside of some of the buffets to get the first hand experiences of consumers who tried the buffets (that didn\'t happen, we ran out of time). \n\nParameters: We narrowed down to Rio, Spice Market, and Harrahs with Paris and Caesars as bonus options. We also had a Players Club card so it was cheaper than just off the street.\n\nFindings: \nThe buffets are only open 7am - 10pm. So there are 9 out of 24 hours that you cannot enjoy a buffet. \nBased on local observations and Yelp reviews, we automatically eliminated Imperial Palace and Flamingo as potential buffets. \nThe Rio does not include the Seafood Buffet. \nIf you get a Saturday or Sunday Brunch in, some of the buffets include champagne and mimosas. \n\nIn Summary: The Rio was good and included the king crab legs which are a waste of time. The Rio had a good dessert bar. The Spice Market where we did brunch had unlimited champagne mimosas. We spent almost 4 hours in here and probably had a bottle of champagne each. Lots of precious time to try another buffet but worth it for the taste and value. Harrahs was just a mediocre buffet but a good finish to the day. Didn\'t fit in Paris or Caesars because we spent too much time at Spice Market. \n\nRecommendations: Skip the salad bar and pasta stations unless it\'s a specialty item. You can get lettuce and spaghetti anywhere and it takes up precious space in the stomach. It is OK to start with dessert. And take small portions so you can taste everything then go back for seconds on what you like.

The Buffet of Buffets is a good option. In a 24-hour period, you can visit seven different buffets as much as you want. \n\nThe selection of buffets are widely varied. During our trip we tried Caesars Palace, Imperial Palace and Flamingo. The wait at Caesars was quite long for lunch, but in the end I enjoyed the quality of the food and service, and the environment was modern and enjoyable. \n\nWe tried Imperial Palace because we happened to be close to it, and boy, that was a mistake! You could be polite and call the decor kitschy, but the buffet seems like an old run-down cafeteria. With a choice of other better buffets, I would avoid this one. \n\nWe tried going to Paris (which we have enjoyed in the past), but the wait at 8pm would have been at least 90 minutes, so we wound up at the Flamingo. The Flamingo was a nice surprise -- it's not the most modern, but the dining room is clean and airy, and the selection is pretty good. Most people seem to be going to the higher-end buffets, so there wasn't a huge wait here. For dinner, they have a lot of Asian selections, including a build-your-own-bowl-of-ramen bar. We also wound up here for Saturday brunch which includes all-you-can-drink champagne and a bloody mary bar (the first bloody mary is free). If you get seated near the windows, you get a lovely view of the garden with live flamingos and koi pond.\n\nIf we were being strategic about our buffet visits, I would have skipped Imperial Palace and planned for either Planet Hollywood (which I have also enjoyed in the past) or Paris. Another buffet that you can visit is the one at Rio, but that would be lower on my list. The food is OK, but it's another room that could use some updating. I mean, seriously, could someone please replace the lightbulbs in that crazy 80's chandelier thing? More than half of them are burned out -- that's just plain lazy!", 'business_id': 'cRfn_vMQ9YExuKb378CwjQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2010-11-30', 'type': 'review'}

We can't say we ate full meals at each, and we can't say we really enjoyed the last few buffets.  But we did it, and we brag about it on a regular basis.\n\nFirst, a note... my husband and I do not have an eating problem.  We only intended to hit 3 or 4 buffets.  You can get your money's worth doing that.  But once we got a couple under our belt, then it became a pride thing to complete the challenge.  So here's how we did it.\n\n#1 - Caesar's\nWe started with lunch on Friday.  The food and the atmosphere is great here.  But considering the size of Caesar's, I was surprised by how small the buffet is.  It seems they go for quality over quantity, which is not always my preference.  There was a line to get in, so keep that in mind when planning.\n\n#2 - Harrah's\nWe were walking by the casino, and there was no line.  So we went in to check out the options and ended up getting a second dessert.  There's not a lot of buffets where cotton candy is available.. it was a nice, light treat.\n\n#3 - Imperial Palace\nIt's an older property, and the buffet is not much more than a small cafeteria.  We got a quick salad, and moved right along.\n\n#4 - Flamingo\nI did another dessert here.  Don't judge... I'm a sucker for a chocolate fountain!  And if you're walking the Strip, the Flamingo is right next to the Imperial Palace.  So it was easier to get some chocolate and then go to dinner, rather than back-track.\n\n#5 - Paris\nWe had a nice dinner here.  Again, there was a line to get in.  But since we had already hit 4 buffets during the afternoon hours, having some extra time to digest didn't bother me.  There's some nicer high-end items at the Paris, but with a higher quantity than Caesar's.  So it was one of the best of the bunch.\n\n#6 - Rio\nWe didn't wake up hungry on Saturday, but the Rio Carnival buffet has always been one of my favorites.  And on weekend mornings, mimosas are included.  So knowing the hard part was over, we gathered up what was left of our appetites and headed back towards the Strip.  We would have had a nice leisurely breakfast, if we didn't have to keep an eye on the clock.  But there was one more stop....\n\n# 7 - Planet Hollywood\nIn retrospect, I wish we had done this one earlier.  I had never been before, and I think I would have enjoyed it more if I hadn't stuffed myself over the past 23 hours.  There are some great international items, including fresh made naan.   Unfortunately, I only had a few bites before I told my husband it was time to go home and nap.\n\nA final note... your 24 hours start when you purchase the first buffet.  The time will be noted on your receipt.  If you're in line when your time is up, too bad.  There are generally lines at Caesar's, Paris, Rio and Planet Hollywood... some of them can be up to an hour, if you go at a peak time.  So keep that in mind, if you want to hit all 7.", 'business_id': 'cRfn_vMQ9YExuKb378CwjQ', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2010-11-30', 'type': 'review'}

But I guess that's better than losing money at the casinos...\n\nSome tips:\n-as others have mentioned, join the free total rewards, to save a few bucks\n-try to go a little earlier than the peak times, for shorter wait times\n-don't waste time at the bad buffets. Research in advance. I actually exclusively went to Paris and Planet hollywood\n-don't forget about the law of diminishing returns.

My main gripe about this is that even though you've essentially already paid for the buffet, you still have to wait in line to get in. That makes absolutely no sense to me, I don't see why there's not some sort of express line or at least allow people with the wristband to enter through the diamond/platinum entrance. It seems borderline pointless to get this pass while waiting in the infamously absurd lines for the Rio, Paris and Planet Hollywood buffets. \n\nAlso, I really wish the pass was for 48 hours instead of 24. I originally intended to hit 3 of the buffets (Carnival World, which I omitted in place of Harrah's thanks to how frustrating the line was that night, Le Village at Paris and Spice Market at Planet Hollywood) and yet I only hit two thanks to an almost 3 hour wait at Paris (we got there at 1:00, didn't get in until almost 4:00). Not only were we both no longer hungry after finishing up but the line at the Spice Market was almost as bad as it was at Paris anyway. I think our game plan would have worked much better if we could have spread this out over 3 days, even in a period that's not as busy as Christmastime. Your stomach can only hold so much. \n\nI felt I did get my money's worth as the price of both of those buffets combined would have come out to be a few dollars more than the price of the promotion. The Harrah's buffet was pitiful, but Le Village more than made up for that and I definitely know I would go to the latter again, so I'll give the Buffet of Buffets that, but I will probably never do this again.", 'business_id': 'cRfn_vMQ9YExuKb378CwjQ', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2010-12-25', 'type': 'review'}

I'm not a huge buffet fan and the prospect of eating at 7 buffets in one day was not something I was looking forward to. But it was her birthday so I agreed. And I have to admit I was kind of looking forward to trying that many places in one day.\n\nOur plan was to hit every buffet in one day. Did we make it? Let's see...\n\nWe started our journey at 7:51 a.m. at Le Village at the Paris as we wanted to try their breakfast crepes. I had lyonnaise potatoes, chicken and bacon sausage, an assortment of cheeses, warm cherries, scrambled eggs with lox, and poached pear. It was all very good. My wife had a banana and blueberry crepe and eggs Florentine which were also good. The waitresses were extremely friendly and the setting was very unique and Parisian. The Paris had the best service of all the places we tried.\n\nNext we walked to the Emperor's buffet at Imperial Palace. We figured this would probably be one of the worst buffets so wanted to get out of the way during breakfast time when most places have the least selection. We were right. This was BY FAR the WORST buffet we tried. I did not like this one at all. Not much looked appealing. I only had a Little cottage cheese, a tomato, and a fried shrimp. The shrimp was rubbery. My wife had a mushroom salad and a macaroon. The macaroon was decent. There are many much better buffets in town. I will not be back.\n\nWe then walked over to Flavors at Harrah's. This was the surprise (almost) gem of the day. There was lots of variety and not just your standard buffet fare. I had shu mai, bananas foster, banana pudding, corned beef hash, and fried plantain. It was all pretty decent. The downside was the service. We had to wait 20 minutes for our drinks (soda and water). I hate eating without having a drink to cleanse my palate. Several other patrons were also getting noticeably upset by the delay with the drink orders. Good selection and food, but definitely the worst service of the day.\n\nAfter 3 (albeit very small) meals in the same number of hours, we needed a break from eating. So we walked over to the Flamingo and strolled through their bird sanctuary area. It was a lovely day and I really enjoyed looking at and reading about all of the birds, fish and turtles.\n\nNext up was the Paradise Garden buffet at the Flamingo. This was a middle of the road buffet. The crab legs were kind of sad looking. The Mac and cheese was tasty. The desert bar was one of the best of the day. I especially liked the chocolate fountain with strawberries and marshmallows to dip in it.\n\nBy this time we really were not hungry, so we decided to walk through the Forum shops and watch a couple of the free shows there.\n\nAfter that we headed over to Lago at Casear's. I thought this was going to be one of the better buffets. I was wrong. This buffet was just okay. The crab legs were bigger than the Flamingo's and the Mac and cheese was good. The cookies on the dessert area looked dry. So-so overall selection.\n\nBy this time we were getting tired and my phone was starting to die from taking pictures and writing reviews all day, so we headed back to the Paris to sit in the car for awhile and charge our phones. When we got to the car, I couldn't find my keys. Keep in mind we had walked all over the strip and through the Forum shops. Many of the keys on my key chain (including my car) are the only set I had. I didn't even know where to start looking for my keys. We figured we'd retrace our steps and start calling every hotel and buffet we'd been to. We were already at the Paris so I first stopped by the buffet to see if they had found my keys. HALLELUJAH! My keys were there. What a relief!\n\nWe returned to the car and rested for an hour or so. Then we walked over to the Spice Market buffet at the Planet Hollywood. This ended up being my favorite buffet. They had a great selection. Highlights were the lamb and baklava. By that point, I wasn't really looking forward to another buffet after grazing all day, but this made me want to actually eat again. That says a lot when you're on your 6th buffet of the day.\n\nNext we walked around the Miracle Mile shops for awhile to burn off a few calories before hitting our final destination.\n\nLastly, we drove over to the Rio for our finale at the Carnival World buffet. The Rio was the biggest of the buffets and had decent quality. This was my second favorite. Nice variety with something for everyone. We finished around 9 p.m.\n\nWe talked about getting up early and hitting a breakfast buffet before our time ran out...but the next morning the last thing either of us wanted to do was eat.\n\nI'm glad we did the Buffet of Buffets, but it was definitely a once in a lifetime experience. I don't ever want to eat that much again in my life. It's a great deal though and I would consider buying a pass again and just hit up two or three of my favorite buffets.", 'business_id': 'cRfn_vMQ9YExuKb378CwjQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2010-12-26', 'type': 'review'}

The sushi was TERRIBLE, like 2 day old grocery store sushi that\'s been sitting in the refrigerator.  I didn\'t even feel safe to eat it. \n\nCaesar\'s - "Lago Buffet" -- Breakfast had tons of cute cups of yogurt and telltale garnish...along with SNOW CRAB LEGS...FOR BREAKFAST?!

But everyone at our table was gone for 10 minutes (waiting for crepes), and the busboy completely cleaned our table. We came back to an empty table...that was a sad moment, but our waitress was very apologetic and replaced all the utensils and drinks for us. Their desserts were okay, nothing memorable. Overall, it was a good buffet place, nothing to rave about, nothing to complain about.\n\nPlanet Hollywood - we came here TWICE. Once, right after the Paris one, and we all pretty much SAT there and didn't eat much. But the second time we came back, we were ready to eat. Their cocktail shrimps were so fresh and good!!! That was my favorite for sure. Everything else was good too. They had such a huge variety of everything. \n\nRio SEAFOOD buffet - Once upon a time, this used to be my favorite. I had to come here because I was dreaming about their raw oysters. On top of the Buffet deal, I had to pay $15 to eat here (since it's not included with the $40 deal). But I figured, sure, it should be worth it. But nope, the oysters were NOT FRESH AT ALL, and neither were most of their seafoods. I was very very very disappointed. Maybe you'll be lucky enough when you go to half some fresh seafood!", 'business_id': 'cRfn_vMQ9YExuKb378CwjQ', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2011-02-18', 'type': 'review'}

I highly recommend doing breakfast at Paris because they have a great selection, the bacon is crispy, and their crepes are pretty damn good (gotta get it was nutella... reminded me of one I got from a street vendor in Paris... the city that is!).  The lunch wasn't too bad either.  The prime rib was juicy but the other meats like fried chicken and pork were a little dry.

Unfortunately, due to some scheduling mishap we couldn't hit up the Rio for lunch so we ended up back at Paris.  Their dinner selection was nearly identical to their lunch so we weren't all that impressed.  This time their prime rib was a little drier.  \n\nThe next morning we got up early enough to get our money's worth and hit up Planet Hollywood.  Standard breakfast stuff but nothing to write home about.  Nothing really stood out to me.  It was just okay.\n\nI gave the Buffet of Buffets 4 stars for 2 reasons... 1) Paris' breakfast was really quite good and 2) It's a pretty damn good deal.

After reading a majority of the reviews on Yelp I decided that the Buffet of Buffets would be worth the money. I got a Total Rewards card (why not, it's free) then purchased the BoB. We started at Rio Carnival for dinner @ 6:38pm. I was highly disappointed since so many Yelpers raved about it. There was a HUGE selection of food, but at best it tasted mediocre. Plus the line was ridiculous. The saving grace was the dessert (bananas foster killed) and our server Krystyna who never let our drinks empty. We were staying at the Paris so it made sense to have breakfast @ Le Village. Oh my goodness! It was spectacular!!!! The turkey bacon tasted like Thanksgiving turkey, plus you could have them make you an omelet or eggs any way you want them, plus fruit toppings for pancakes/french toast. The sausage was very good, and my fiance couldn't stop raving about the corned beef hash. Next was Caesars Lago for lunch. It was ok. Not much of a selection. Dessert was almost wiped out and it didn't look like any of the staff cared to re-stock it. Then we had Harrah's Flavors for dinner before the 24hrs expired. It was pretty good. There was A LOT of meat, very little veggie selection (mashed potatoes of course, but little else). Everything was tasty. There's cotton candy for dessert and you can take as many as you want with you as you leave! We decided to hit Planet Hollywood for lunch the next day even though our BoB was expired. Mostly due to the fact that if you checked in there on FB you got BOGO @ Spice Market Buffet. That was the best out of the bunch! An excellent selection of EVERYTHING and absolutely delicious. I really like the Middle Eastern selection of food. Plus they had smoothies and very good dessert. A very well-rounded selection of food for everyone.

It's a great price for a lot of food, depending on if you were planning on spending that much on food anyway. The quality isn't great, but the variety and excitement of trying different buffets is fun.\n\n3 buffets during the 24-hour period is definitely doable and very realistic.  We chose to do dinner at the Village Seafood Buffet at the Rio (8 pm Friday night w/ short line), breakfast at Paris (about 40 minutes wait at 11 am Saturday morning), and dinner at Planet Hollywood (no wait at 6 pm on Saturday night...though a HUGE line formed at 7 pm).  3 buffets was the perfect amount, since more would be too much food and too much time going from one hotel to another and waiting in line.  Granted our lines weren't too long this past weekend, I can't imagine doing more than this many buffets on a busy weekend.  \n\nTIP: Go to the buffet you're looking forward to the most FIRST, and the one you're not as excited about last.  Do one good buffet for dinner, and the other one for breakfast/lunch.  Your last buffet definitely won't taste as good or be as exciting after all the gorging and excitement from the first couple you go to.\n\nWe decided to do the Village Seafood Buffet at the Rio first, since I love seafood and was looking forward to that.  I parked in the Masquerade parking lot of the Rio, which lead directly to the buffet on the first floor.  We went and got our Total Rewards card first (which was a 20 minute line on a Friday night in March, this past weekend). It wasn't a far walk from the buffet.  Just a few minutes into the casino and you'll see signs.\n\nOnce we got our card, we got in line to the buffet.  Since the Village Seafood was new to the Buffet of Buffets, I asked to make sure we could buy our Buffet of Buffets there.  And sure enough, we could.  They used our Total Rewards card as the buffet card and gave us a receipt to put on our table while we eat there and hold on later to in case for some reason the card doesn't work.  Make sure to take the receipt off your table when you leave the buffet.  It has the Buffet of Buffets listed on there.\n\nOf the 3 buffets we went to, Paris was my favorite for breakfast and lunch.  Here are the good and maybe unique things I noticed about each.\n\nVillage Seafood Buffet at Rio: (8 pm, Friday night - 10 min wait)\n(2 stars - not that much unique food, and only worth it if you're okay with the following and really craving it)\n- small halves of lobster tails\n- warm plump shrimp in lobster tail mix\n- oysters (frozen and thawed)\n- crab claws (not fresh and kinda mushy)\n- cold crab legs (though most buffets have this)\n\nLe Village at Paris: (11 am, Saturday morning - 45 min wait)\n(4 stars - LOTS of variety for breakfast and lunch)\n- sweet crepes made to order (though they used preserves instead of fresh berries)\n- omelets made to order (VERY nice guy serving us at this station)\n- lox (Make your own bagel, cream cheese, and smoked salmon lox! I LOVED this and wish I got it first.\n- small Mediterranean section\n- lunch food served along with breakfast (breakfast is served until 3 pm, they said) \n\nPlanet Hollywood: (6 pm, Saturday night - no wait...LONG line at 7 pm!)\n(3 stars - nothing special or too unique, but good variety of food)\n- Mediterranean, American, Mexican, Italian, Asian foods\n- chocolate-covered strawberries (load up on these whenever you see them because they go quick; taste like fondue chocolate though and not real melted quality chocolate)\n- good variety of food, though most sections were small and didn't have a lot of different foods\n*PH was a PAIN to find. The parking lot is over on the side and also behind on the street parallel to LV Blvd. You can't get in from LV Bvld, so don't waste your time like we did.  THEN, we had to walk through mall about 5 minutes to get to the casino.  What a pain!  Maybe I missed it, but access to PH made me never want to go there again by car.\n\nIf I had this to do over again, I think I might not even get this Buffet of Buffets card, unless I want lots of food and don't care too much about quality.  I apparently tried the 3 that had the highest ratings and wasn't impressed with any of them except the Paris buffet.  \n\nI think I might just fork out the extra cash and do either the Bellagio or Wynn buffets, which I heard great things about.  They're about $50 each though.  And definitely I would do the Paris for breakfast/lunch again.  Those two would probably add up to a bit more than what I spent on the Buffet of Buffets card with the Village Seafood added (about $60 total, with Total Rewards card).  \n\nI think I'd rather spend more on quality over quantity. Plus, it was a bit of a pain scheduling our day around driving to the hotels and waiting in line for buffets. I think you may do that anyway, but with this card, you have to time it right to get in your money's worth for the 24-hour period, especially if you wanna do more than 3 buffets.", 'business_id': 'cRfn_vMQ9YExuKb378CwjQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2011-03-16', 'type': 'review'}

Twelve grueling hours. Seven AYCE establishments. This is the story of the BoB.\n\n9am Lago Buffet (Caesars Palace)\nMy strategy was to eat a single breakfast plate. I went with a smoked salmon made-to-order omelet, some Canadian bacon, and some strawberry yogurt. I also had a couple of mimosas. Good, conservative start to the long day ahead.\n\n10:30am Paradise Garden Buffet (Flamingo)\nThis initially looked like a pretty crappy buffet, but hidden treasures awaited. First of all, there was another section that we didn't originally see, complete with a crepe station. Then, we discovered an entire Asian section that opens up at 11am. With a nice view of the flamingos outside and more champagne in our glasses, this turned out to be a good buffet. The highlight for me was the Asian food - chicken feet, shumai, and some sort of sake dessert.\n\n12pm Emperor's Buffet (Imperial Palace)\nEasily the worst buffet of the bunch. The iced tea tasted strange. I went with a very selective plate of tiny portions. The only positive was that the beef stroganoff was pretty not bad.\n\n1:30pm Flavors Buffet (Harrah's)\nThough I had tried to pace myself, the surprisingly good Flamingo buffet filled me up more than I had planned. Still, we powered on. Nice buffet with a good selection. I enjoyed the Churrasco Beef from the Brazilian area, some warm crab legs, and more shumai. Their dessert section was also pretty impressive.\n\n3pm Carnival World Buffet (Rio)\nYou know you're getting full when the first thing you do is sit down for about five minutes. Don't everyone get up at once! This was the last buffet that treated us to complimentary champagne (but we were in the VIP section, so don't count on that). I forgot how huge the Rio buffet is. Nothing really stood out, but I enjoyed some cold crab legs, more shumai, some freshly served beef broccoli, and some duck.\n\n5pm Le Village Buffet (Paris)\nHome stretch! The first and last thing I ate here? Why Cr\xe8me br\xfbl\xe9e of course. Other than that, just your standard fare of prime rib with some asparagus and mushrooms. Surprisingly, the crab legs were not as good as Carnival and Flavors. At least the waiter brought those out to us as opposed to us having to get them.\n\n7pm Spice Market Buffet (Planet Hollywood)\nWe made it! Diverse selection, featuring a Mid-Eastern section that you don't normally see. Highlights include roasted lamb, lamb stuffed tomatoes, and baklava. Crab legs were also available and sliced in half (length ways) for easy eating, but I was over crab legs by this point.\n\nD\xe9nouement:\nAll told, the BoB is a great deal. I would never do all seven again, but you would certainly get your money's worth with a couple of dinners and maybe a lunch or breakfast. If I had to pick two, I might go with Planet Hollywood and Harrah's for dinner, with Flamingo for a late breakfast / early lunch (so that you are there as soon as that Asian section opens up with its fresh offerings). The only problem is with lines. We were lucky in that we were hooked up with line passes.\n\nEpilogue:\n24 hours after my pre-BoB weigh-in yesterday morning, I'm actually only 1.5 pounds heavier. It helped that I swam some laps and did a few minutes in the wet sauna at the gym last night. Not bad.

See the pics or the event link for Ken M.'s great schedule.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/events/las-vegas-uye-buffet-of-vegas-buffets-bob\n\nIt's a good time with a bunch of friends and definitely an experience.", 'business_id': 'cRfn_vMQ9YExuKb378CwjQ', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2011-03-20', 'type': 'review'}

Otherwise, you'll just essentially be paying too much for one buffet. Have 3 or 4 sane meals and a dessert break. \n5) Focus on what buffet's do well: breakfast, dessert, crab, fresh batches and the odd diamond in the rough.\n\nI think the confusion with whether the food is good or not comes from the point of reference. Las Vegas buffets take every other buffet to the tool shed. However, they will never challenge the quality of good restaurants and good home cooking, at least except for the flan at Paris (OMFG that was good). I am a skilled home cook and have eaten at plenty of fine restaurants. I still enjoy the buffet because having just one or two bites of so many different things is fun and as long as you play to the buffet's strengths, the food is good.\n\nIronically, the 24 hour buffet isn't a great value in terms of quantity. If you are looking for fuel for the money, you'll be better off buying just one buffet per day, preferably breakfast. I'm a camel so I do fine eating a ton once a day but I suspect lots of people could do fine with a big breakfast and an evening snack.\n\nThe value is liberty and food security.

For $50 you get 24 magical hours of access to all seven Caesars property buffets. I'd been wanting to try this for some time, but didn't trust myself and my uncontrollable appetite... but my brother came to town and bought me a pass, so how could I say no?!\n\nI strategized this as much as possible: since there is no way, no how that I can ever be out and about in time for breakfast, we decided to do lunch at noon, followed by 4:30 supper and 8:30 dinner, followed by 11am brunch the following day (the buffet pass is good for 24hours from the time of purchase). \n\nThe consensus on Yelp! is that Rio, Planet Hollywood and Paris had the best buffets, so we made those a priority. Started out with lunch at the Rio's Carnival World Buffet, which is huge and has the best variety out of all of them. After 3 plates, we went hiking in Red Rock to work up an appetite for our 4:30 dinner at Planet Hollywood's Spice Market Buffet. This buffet was smaller than the Rio's, but pretty much the same quality of food... with the added bonus of a Middle Eastern station, which I LOVED! Based on this station alone, Planet Hollywood was my favorite buffet.\n\nAfter that, I had to go to work at Caesars Palace. On my break, I stopped into the Caesars buffet [NOTE: this was before they remodeled the buffet -- see footnote] and was sorely disappointed -- it was small, with the same wilted-looking stuff they serve to the employees down in the hotel dining room!! The desserts, which supposedly they are known for, weren't even all that. The only cool thing here is they have a huge fruit bin full of kiwis, pears, apples, bananas and whole miniature pineapples...so if you're into fruit, this buffet wouldn't be a total wast of time.\n\nMeanwhile, while I was at work my brother went and checked out the Flamingo and Harrahs, neither of which was very impressive, according to him (especially not the Flamingo). \n\nThe following morning we rolled out of bed and waddled back down to the Paris, to try one last buffet before our wristbands expired at noon. The Le Village Buffet was actually pretty good, with a good variety of foodie-food like Brie-and-bacon mac & cheese and made-to-order crepes. Plus the ambience is awesomely kitsch: like you're inside a Thomas Kinkade painting, with food spilling out of all these little fake chateaux.  \n\nFinal Verdict: worth it, if only for the obscene fun of it all. You probably won't be able to eat $50 worth of food, but it's fun to try!\n\nFOOTNOTE: the new Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars is WAY better than the old one...but if you want it included with the 24-hour wristband, you have to pay a $15 surcharge.

Needless to say, I gained 5.5 lbs after this ordeal.....and I'm still trying to work off the lbs in the gym.\n\nOverall, it was a fun time and I recommend giving it a try at least once.  The schedule we had was perfect and we were on time for every buffet, except the last one.....but that was because there was a concert that night at Planet Hollywood and it made parking a little longer than expected.  If I was to do it again, I'd only go to 3 Buffets.....the Rio, Harrah's, and Planet Hollywood.  I'd have Dinner at the Rio & Planet Hollywood, and Lunch at Harrah's.  Those were the 3 best buffets out of the group and you can easily fit 3 of those in a 24 hour schedule.\n\nThe 7 in one day was very agressive and I won't do it again.....but I don't regret participating in the event.....all of the Yelpers in our group had a blast.\n\nReturn Factor - 80%", 'business_id': 'cRfn_vMQ9YExuKb378CwjQ', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2011-03-24', 'type': 'review'}

Rio- Brunch- service was OK, LOTS OF VARIETY- I was already extremely full when I discovered there was a whole other half of the buffet I haven't seen before. They had a really yummy dessert station with a Gelato booth. The must try was there Asian noodle bar; where you can have Pho, egg noodles and other types made. \n2. Planet Hollywood- Dinner, had a really nice waitress who recommended stuff for us to eat there, their middle eastern bar was the must try, I absolutely LOVED their lamb kabob's, Not as much variety as the Rio, but my favorite by far. \n3. Flamingo- Dinner- in my experience- TERRIBLE, their must try Chinese food station was closed down for the night, so I am not sure if my judgment was valid. The food, was generic, and not that great. Only decent thing they had was the Chocolate Fondue, and the Burrito Bar where someone could make it for you. \n4. Harrah's- Dinner- Pretty good food, but I don't have an accurate opinion since, my stomach was exploding by the time we made our way over to this buffet. Their must try was the Prime Rib, but I didn't try it. They also had a very yummy Gelato Station- Mint flavor! The service we got there, wasn't the best though. \n5. Paris- Brunch- I don't know if it was the fact, that I was no longer exploding from all the food, but this buffet was definitely delicious. The interior of the buffet itself was quite beautiful. I didn't really try the dessert station, but their sushi was quite delicious, and their pesto pasta as well. They also served Smoked Salmon on toast with cream cheese! Lastly, their Crepe Station was quite nice. \n\nOverall, the Buffet of Buffets is good deal, if you plan your trips well- just don't expect to have a comfortable stomach by the end of this 24 hour period.", 'business_id': 'cRfn_vMQ9YExuKb378CwjQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2011-03-29', 'type': 'review'}

I looked through Yelp, and saw which ones had the highest stars.  The ones I\'m going to focus on are Rio and Paris.\n\nRio has two buffets, one is seafood (and costs $15 extra) and the other is international.  \n\nNot everyone in my party liked seafood so we went to the international.  \n\nIt was my favorite buffet, so we went to this one twice.  It was busy during dinner, but the cash registers are set up so that people can pass through quickly.  \n\nThe selection was amazing.  The stations stretched on and on.  I was scared by how much food there was.  The food, for the most part, tasted better than the Paris Le Village Buffet.  It had a lot of cheap foods, but there were some interesting features like the soup station where you can get your choice of Asian soups including Pho or Tom Yum.  There was also a lot of different types of gelatos and sorbets.  \n\nThere was almost no difference in selection from lunch to dinner.  The main difference was the crab legs.  The crab legs at Rio were much better than the ones at Paris, which were covered with black spots.  The desserts at Rio, for the most part, were bland and dry.  \n\nMy first waitress was nice and fairly attentive, but she had on one of those fake smiles which scared me a little.  The second waiter was really funny and very attentive.  He brought us the tool used to break open the crab legs, and showed us how to use it, and refilled our drinks before we even asked.  He also cracked some jokes.  \n\nThe line at the buffet at Paris felt long.  It was in actuality only a little over half an hour long on a Tuesday night.  There were a good assortment of seafood and vegetables like pearl onions here, but the food was cold.  I was surprised, because I have eaten at Paris before, and the food was much better before.  The lady who served us did not understand English well, and did not get our drinks correct.  The custard ice cream here is amazingly delicious.  It was the best part.  There were only two flavors, though.  I got the vanilla.', 'business_id': 'cRfn_vMQ9YExuKb378CwjQ', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2011-03-31', 'type': 'review'}

A game of Monopoly for your tummy.\n\nLike any good game of Monopoly, grab the car.  The Rio isn't really walking distance, and it's the Boardwalk of buffets.  If your appetite is the thimble, you wont be getting a true value.\n\nSpeaking of value, let me crunch a few numbers here.  In numerous trips to Las Vegas, my foodie loving, wine swilling, sales tax paying, happily tipping self (and wife) spend on average $32 for breakfast, $43 on lunch (although often lunch is skipped if breakfast is filling enough) and $54 on dinner.  The BoB runs $97.27 for 2, not counting alcohol.  Since it is a buffet, eating a massive breakfast means skipping lunch.  A bottle of wine with dinner adds $10-$15 to the total (I don't need wine for breakfast) Therefore, the BoB costs about $110 for $86 worth of food.  Not a great value.  Since the BoB runs for 24 hours, we maximized value by starting our 24hr clock with a late dinner and ending with an early dinner the next day.\n\nIf you already planned on doing this, then you are the person that would willingly trade away the more expensive green properties for the cheaper gold (or red) properties.  You are a wise one, Uncle Pennybags.\n\nIn Monopoly, some properties just aren't worth the money. Baltic and Mediterranean Aves spring to mind.  Likewise, the Imperial Palace buffet isn't worth the belly space.\n\nCaesars Lago buffet is perhaps the most popular, like the light blue properties between Oriental and Connecticut.  Since your 24 hour pass expires exactly at 24 hours, don't head to Caesars with 30 minutes left. Your pass will expire as you wait in line.\n\nIn the end, the BoB is just a good value, but not a great one, and not even that if you don't plan well.  Like Monopoly, it's fun, but not great fun.  It is a viable dining option though.", 'business_id': 'cRfn_vMQ9YExuKb378CwjQ', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2011-04-08', 'type': 'review'}

We started on Thursday night Spice Market Buffet, get there around 7:30pm and waited 40 mins to get in. love their crepes, middle east part (grilled meat), hummas, and have lot of desert to choose from.  overall, this is my favorite.    Second we went to Harrah's around 10am for breakfast, line was short, less than 5 mins to get in.  have lot of food, becaon are crispy, I got some smoke salmon, and fresh strawberry.  have some lunch items as well.  Have lot of deserts even in the morning, this is the place hobbie find his pecan tart. The puff pastry are really good.  This is much more modern than the last time I visited.  It's my #2 choice, definitely worth to stop by. Then totally skipped lunch...can't breath.  Went to Rio around 4:30 for dinner. also less than 5 mins to get in. lot of food, but nothing really special at this point. The bonus for me is their mango ice-cream, the best compared to the Harrah's, desert bar does not look too good, not too many choices to choose from, so we left and went to Paris for desert, around 6:40pm, less than 25 people in line, we got in less than 10 mins.

Venturing the Las Vegas Strip with black wristbands on their wrists, they hopped from hotel to hotel in search of bountiful yummy things to eat.

Just in time for brunch, we liked that they had made-to-order omelettes + crepes... but everything else was your mediocre typical buffet fare of so-so prime rib, crab legs, cocktail shrimp, crappy sushi, pastas, etc. The highlight is definitely the chocolate fountain that you can drip skewers of marshmallows, fruit + rice crispy squares into. Only worth grabbing 1 plate of food each plus chocolate dipped dessert + cotton candy to-go.      \n\nLago Buffet (Caesars) - 3:30pm\n- Originally arriving around 2:15, this was the only buffet we had to wait over an hour in line for, + although it gave us time to digest, it wasn\'t  worth it. The food quality, variety + plating was more creative than Flamingo with the salad medley cups + the desserts... but we knew we still had better options ahead. Only grabbed 1 plate of food + a hand-scooped ice cream cone each to-go.    \n\nLe Village Buffet (Paris) - 4:30pm\n-  The late afternoon is the BEST time to hit up the more popular buffets. No line + we had our pick of the last of brunch + got first pickings at the dinner options coming out. Favorites here include bouillabaisse, custom crepes, perfectly tender prime rib, bacon-brie mac n cheese, crab claws (not legs, the claw part only), quiche, cr\xe8me br\xfbl\xe9e, etc. We feasted here on at least 1 plate of food + 1 plate of desserts each. My second favorite!  \n\nThe Spice Market Buffet (Planet Hollywood) - 6:00pm\n- Just beat the dinner rush + took our time here stretching our tummies to the max before a long night of partying ahead. Despite being spoiled by Le Village buffet, we liked the rack of lamb, the crab legs that were pre-split + came both chilled + steamed, skewered meat, stuffed pork loin + shrimp cocktail in a martini glass. At least 1 plate each + more cotton candy to-go! \n\n\n* SUNDAY *\n\nCarnival World Buffet (Rio) - 9:30am\n- My favorite of the 7! Encompassing the flavors of the world, the buffet options seemed to never end as I had a tough time being selective about what to load my empty tummy with! In addition to made-to-order omelettes for breakfast, we feasted on made-to-order teppanyaki, roast duck, taco bar, sushi that was actually good, different kinds of ribs, etc. Gotta love the bar in the middle with the blasting of drink specials over the PA system even before 10am... LOL. Worth eating more than 1 plate of food each plus gelato to-go!  \n\nFlavors, The Buffet (Harrah\'s) - 11:30am\n- Not too memorable except for its similarity to the Flamingo buffet in variety, general mediocrity, + having to pre-order our first drink with the cashier. Other than your typical buffet fare, some unique selections were veggie spring rolls, giant corned beef shank + fajita bar. Only grabbed 1 plate of food here plus a cute Easter decorated dessert to go. (My current Yelp profile pic was taken here)\n\nEmperor\'s Buffet (Imperial Palace) - 12:40pm\n- Yes, we saved the worst for last. Compared to the other 6, this janky buffet is worse than a school dining hall but with decades-old tacky tiki decor. Shrimp cocktail is tiny, salmon is white as if it were canned, the "Asian noodles" is spaghetti noodles stir-fried in soy sauce... *shudders* We shared a couple plates of food/desserts + called it a day. Don\'t waste the valuable real estate in your tummy here.  \n\n*****\n\nStrategically, we planned this out perfectly so we barely had any line waiting + so we would hit up the better 3 buffets for more key meal times (dinner-ish before a long night of partying + then brunch the following day). \n\nPriced at $44.99 for Gold Card members or $49.99 for non-members, this is a steal of a deal. But even BETTER is staying in one of their properties + booking the Buffet of Buffets package deal. Over Easter weekend, our 2-night stay at Imperial Palace with the package cost us \n\n   $213 (package of 2 nights + 2 BofB passes) \n+ $48 (1 extra BofB pass)\n----------\n   $261  \n\nSplit between 3 girls... that\'s DIRT CHEAP since it covered all lodging expenses + majority of our eating expenses. Yea we chose ghetto Imperial Palace rather than nicer hotels offering the package, but we spent less than 12 hours in the hotel anyways so it wasn\'t a big deal.\n\nAnd then factoring in how we hit up 4 clubs/lounges including 2 open bars in 2 nights... this was perhaps my favorite Vegas trip EVER!', 'business_id': 'cRfn_vMQ9YExuKb378CwjQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2011-05-09', 'type': 'review'}

I really wanted to go to the Rio though based on my visit beforehand I remember it being really good.", 'business_id': 'cRfn_vMQ9YExuKb378CwjQ', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2011-05-17', 'type': 'review'}

So you can say that our strategy of when, where, what and how to eat  was one year in the making. I was really itching to try it. My original plan was to have 7 meals at 6 different venues. But at the end I could only manage 6 buffets at 5 casinos. My wife is a light eater so she didn\'t want to do it. It was my son and me and here is how it went down:\n\nFirst day, April 24\n5:30PM   Purchased buffet pass at Le Village Buffet at Paris (we were staying at Paris for two nights before moving to Bellagio for two more nights). All the meat dishes are so so. The lamb was especially chewy. It could be me, but the supposed French foods here tasted no more different than any other American buffet. Overall rating 3  *** out of 5.\n\n9:30PM   Walked over to Paradise Garden Buffet at Flamingo for night snack. My son and I both had the authentic made to order Vietnamese pho with fish and beef balls. Also had some fresh fruits, cakes and cookies. They were very good and I would have to agree with some of the previous reviews that this buffet is the sleeper of the group.****\n\nSecond day, April 25\n7:00AM    I am an early riser. I woke up at 5 and played a couple of hours of slots before headed to the Le Village Buffet for breakfast. I had a lot of my favorite, smoked salmon, plus the usual breakfast fares, orange juice, toast and coffee.***\n\n9:30AM   My son woke up at 9 and we walked over to the Lago Buffet at Caesar Palace . This was the only one with a line but we were seated immediately because we already had the pass. Again I ate a lot of smoked salmon. My son loved the pancakes. The sausage and bacon were very good also very good. ****1/2\n\n12:00PM   My wife joined us for lunch buffet at Carnival World Buffet at Rio. We took the shuttle bus from Ballys and it only took 10 min. There was an abundance of food to choose from. It truly lived up to the name "World Buffet".****1/2\n\n2:30PM   Was gonna go to Flavors, The Buffet at Harrahs for afternoon tea. But we had to scrap the plan because we were just too full from the earlier lunch.\n\n5:15PM   Walked over next door from Paris to Spice Market Buffet at Planet Hollywood. The crab legs and prime rib were excellent. And we got to try for the first time Middle Eastern food a a buffet. In my opinion, Spice Market Buffet was the best of the five.*****\n\n    Overall it was a wonderful experience. I love to eat and I like variety. So this was perfect for me. I didn\'t  feel bloated at the end of the 2nd day and I am still not tired of buffet yet. We definitely got our money\'s worth. I enjoyed it thoroughly and we will do it again next year as long as the price is not more than $50. And I wish they would extend the\nhours from 24 to a 26 hours all you can eat buffet.  A couple of hours more would definitely made the whole event even more enjoyable.', 'business_id': 'cRfn_vMQ9YExuKb378CwjQ', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2011-05-21', 'type': 'review'}

I don't know why we decided to do this but we did.  I kept questioning our decision...really? Buffet for the next 24 hours?  Holy moly!  Yes, you heard me right; unlimited buffet for 24 hours for $44.99 for Total Rewards members (just go sign up at the total rewards booth) and $49.99 for non-members.   Ugh.\n\nGiven my reservations, this was not a bad idea.  It's definitely worth the money given that one buffet meal would have cost us about $18-$30.  So how many times could we squeeze in buffet trips in the given time without wanting to puke?  I'd say about 4 times MAX.\n\n-Meal 1: Spice Market Buffet @PH.  This was where we started.  We had dinner here.  Overall, this was my favorite buffet of the trip.  They have different themed sections marked clearly with bold white lettering...ie. Mexican, Seafood, Mid-Easter, dessert, etc.  I gorged myself on pre-halved crab legs and pre-peeled shrimp cocktail.  My husband loved the cotton candy and the cr\xe8me brulee was yummy too.  4 stars\n\n-Meal 2 : Spice Market Buffet.  Since we were staying at PH we decided to come here for a quick breakfast before we set out for the day.  Breakfast was simple and standard.  The eggs were good and the OJ refreshing...and the coffee saved my life.\n\n-Meal 3 : Le Village Buffet @ Paris.  The line was short here but for some reason we had to wait for 45 minutes!  The food was French-ish and quite mediocre.  I must say that I do like the ambiance.  It succeeds in taking me away to some sort of quaint rustic town.  3 stars\n\n-Meal 4 : Lago Buffet @ Caesars Palace.  Once again, the line was ridiculously slow.  We had tickets to the Cirque Du Soleil LOVE show and we almost had to skip dinner after waiting in line for an hour!  Fortunately, we spoke to one of the managers and she let us slide up front.  Thank you! Thank you!  Lago had the smallest selection of them all.  It was teeny tiny with minimum seating!  The saving factor of this place is the quality of the food.  It was the best of the three I visited, however limited.  The prime rib was restaurant quality and delicious.  I would come back just for that.  3 stars\n\nI enjoyed my Buffet of Buffets experience.  I don't think I'll do it again but it was definitely worth its while.  Besides, we had a good time hopping from buffet to buffet as if we were on a little mission.   But please factor in the lines when you're visiting these buffets.  They are no joke.", 'business_id': 'cRfn_vMQ9YExuKb378CwjQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2011-05-23', 'type': 'review'}

If you are not a gambler or a show person this is a fun way to experience and overindulge in vegas.  You don't have to eat it all. I do wish they served much much smaller portions.\n\n1st choice was rio's buffet. This buffet is ginourmous.  It must be 1500 linear feet long.  Its insane. And everything we ate was pretty dang good. They had these little dumplings that were delic and ny steak in mushroom sauce that was fantabulous.  The desert bar was fab too, with a gelato bar and banana foster my husband just loved.  \n\nNext fav was the spice market at ph.  It was great.  They had middle estern food, a nice italian section and hummus with fresh naan. So so yum. \n\nNext was caesars palace. It is true that this was consderable smaller than the others but the quality is pretty phenom. Gourmet cheeses and pastries that were so lovely and amazing.  The meat was more tender and the sauces richer. If I had my druthers I would snack here.  Or come early for an early breakfast.  \n\nThe next we liked was at the flamingo.  They all seem to have sushi and some have crab and all had prime rib. It was fun sitting next to the flamingo habitat looking over the pond.  This one had crawfish and shrimp.   The food was great, with a crepe station. My husband loved the smoked salmon. I loved the deserts.  \n\nThe last one was good and it was paris.  They had mussels that were nice. I would have expected better bread and pastry selection as well as yummier cheeses. It was a lot like the flamingo spread.  \n\nWe did not make it to harrahs or imperial palace.  \n\nThe main disclaimer I would include that we did take into consideration that it was buffet food and we always went for the wowish foods. We avoided the starches and breads and it seemed all the salad bars were a littl sad. Who wants salad whenyou can have ny strip and dim sum? The lines were often unnecessarily long and the service was just blah or meh.  But it was fun and a great value. \n\nEnjoy!", 'business_id': 'cRfn_vMQ9YExuKb378CwjQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2011-06-04', 'type': 'review'}

I call that cost effective.\nI should say somewhere that I don't normally engage in this kind of wanton gluttony, but I do enjoy a challenge.\n\nNone of the 7 buffets were anywhere near as good as the Wynn, Bellagio or Wicked spoon, IMHO.

I never knew how awesome this deal was until my last Vegas trip (May 2011), where I dropped $121 for two at The Buffet at Wynn ($46/ea "Holiday Pricing" on a Post Office holiday BS + we had the so-called "unlimited" champagne for an additional $10/ea, but with the slow refills, it wasn\'t truly "unlimited").\n\nVegas has mastered the art of the buffet. None of the three buffets we tried were bad, though some were better than others.\n\nMy group of friends tried the following buffets (in order of favorite to least liked):\n1. Spice Market Buffet @ Planet Hollywood - great selection and overall quality of food (dinner) - I\'d say quality of food was close to that of The Buffet at Wynn\n2. Lago Buffet @ Ceasar\'s Palace - went here for a fantastic breakfast.. great service and drinks are quickly served\n3. Flavors Buffet @ Harrah\'s - lunch - worst of the three, but not horrible. Ambiance was underwhelming, but they do have a chocolate fountain where I was able to dip my Rice Krispy Treats in.\n\nOverall a great deal. Although I remember it being cheaper in early 2010, you still can\'t beat the price at under $50 for 3+ meals. It sounds like we missed out on the Paris buffet, but I\'ll make a point to check it out if I do BoB again.\n\nOnly downside to the Buffet of Buffets deal is that you have to continue to wear the wristband the whole time you do it (so when you sleep, shower, go to the pool, etc.. it will be in your pictures lol).', 'business_id': 'cRfn_vMQ9YExuKb378CwjQ', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2011-06-17', 'type': 'review'}

Honestly speaking, there are three above-average buffets in Planet Hollywood, Rio, and Paris, and four not so good ones.  Was it a great experience?  You bet.  Was it worth it?  Definitely.  Will we do it again?  Probably not.\n  \nP.S.

We ended up buying it at 715, had our dinner and then the next day we had breakfast around 10 am, then lunch around 2 pm. We were not at all hungry for dinner by 7... not for a buffet anyways. If we had waited until 8 then we would have been hungry, or at least enough for a slow big dinner. Does that make sense? Okay so anyways, I can say that we made it to some good buffets. \n\nDinner around 7pm night one: Planet Hollywood (Spice Market Buffet)\nI came here the last time I was in Vegas and was EXTREMELY impressed! It was good that it wasn't just a one time thing. This Buffet is delicious!! There is plenty to choose from and the quality is really good. The butterfly shrimp is amazing with the sweet chili sauce(trust me try it!!!)  If your choosing which buffets to try, I HIGHLY recommend this one to be at the top of your list. They have cotton candy!! \n\nBreakfast around 10am day two: Harrah's (Flavors buffet)\nThis was just breakfast so it was really good I don't really know how you can mess up breakfast though. Just do breakfast wherever you are staying. I can say that the size of the buffet was pretty good, so I am assuming that they would have a good selection at lunch and dinner. They have gelato ice cream!! \n\nLunch around 2pm day two: Rio (World buffet)\nOkay, so this buffet comes in a close second place to The Spice Market. I see it like this, if you want Quality, choose Spice Market, but if you want Quantity, choose World Buffet. It really is a world buffet. This buffet is HUGE!! I was so impressed when I walked in, I didn't know where to start!! They have so many things, I liked it here because they have simple foods like hamburgers and Hotdogs! So there is something for the kids too (Spice market is not as kid friendly). I really enjoyed this buffet. Gelato ice cream here and pretty good cannolis!! \n\nI have eaten at the Flamingo buffet (Where we are staying) and it is not worth it at all!! The buffet has very little to choose from compared to the others. I don't recommend wasting a lunch or dinner on it. Breakfast or a snack would be fine, but not a big meal. I do LOVE their chocolate fountain though!! \n\nI didn't even want to try imperial palace because of the bad reviews. I wouldn't have minded trying the Paris one, but we just didn't have time. \n\nHope this review helps!! Have fun in Vegas!! :) \n\n:) nykki", 'business_id': 'cRfn_vMQ9YExuKb378CwjQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2011-06-23', 'type': 'review'}

Maybe it was reading all of the great reviews about PH that upped my expectations and I\'m willing to concede that it might have been an off-day when we went. You will get full, but cold food? I thought that was steam rising from the carving station and the lasagna. I swear they were using dry ice.\n\nI don\'t think I\'ve ever reached for the salt and pepper at a buffet as much as I have here. Still, they have plenty of options.

That said, I don\'t know if the layout at Rio proves more beneficial to the customer or to hotel. \nBeing forced to walk and move to get your second and third (and fourth, etc) plate gives you the opportunity to spare your stomach even a few minutes more before you get yo glutton ON. But I saw a lot of lazy buffet goers and elderly that weren\'t physically able to traverse the distance of the buffet. :( it made me sad.\n\nAs for selection, you can\'t go wrong. There\'s something for any picky-palette. The food was warm or hot-- unless meant to be served cold-- and my favorite station was probably the mongolian wok / on-the-spot stir fry. Most of the food was tough or bland. Desserts looked a little dry, but you can\'t go wrong with a scoop or two of gelato to-go.\n\nwait time: 30 min (1 p.m. on a Tuesday)\nservice: 2 / 5\nvariety: 4 / 5\ntaste: 2 / 5\nvisit again: no\n\nPARIS\nMy favorite of the three. If you decide to visit the buffet at Paris, be sure to give yourself an hour of time to wait in line (i.e. if you have show tickets and want to eat dinner beforehand, understand you\'re going to be waiting and surrounded by cranky people).\nAside from the wait, I found the service here to be the BEST of the three. Ambiance was "cute." Though a smaller buffet with an emphasis on French cuisine-- surprise-- I found the food here to be seasoned and cooked the best. I overheard a woman complain that certain items I enjoyed were too salty.\nYou can\'t please \'em all, but my boyfriend and I agree that if we ever do Buffet of Buffets again, Paris will be the only buffet of the three visited that we grub at again.\n\nwait time: 50 min (4:15 p.m. on a Tuesday-- we thought our passes were going to expire while we were in line!)\nservice: 5 / 5\nvariety: 3 / 5\ntaste: 4 / 5\nvisit again: yes (but only with the Buffet of Buffets pass)\n\n\nYes, I recommend the pass, but only if you can squeeze three meals in a 24 hour period. If you\'re a salad connoisseur, stay away-- I mean, you can find cheaper places to eat leaves at. In all seriousness, though, none of the salad stations at any of the three looked tempting.\n\nMy vote goes for Paris, and people will disagree on which of the seven buffets is the "best," but I think we all agree that Imperial has the worst... just... stay away... \n\nOkay!

Yes, I'd do it again. Would avoid Paris, though. Went twice to Paris (late lunch and breakfast), as we wanted to try the crepes that EVERYONE bragged about. The line to get in both times was long (even middle of the week in August); they're not quick to sit people even though there were alot of empty tables. The crepes were undercooked both times. The woman cooking them in the morning had no idea what she was doing. I've had great crepes and these were just awful. Besides being just bad, there also was no savory options for the crepe fillings. It was all dessert or nothing. I had high hopes for the other dessert offerings and all were blah. The creme brulee was runny. The other pastries were either bland, soft (when should be flaky), or overly sugary. The breakfast items were the same in texture and flavor. Maybe they're cooking for the average American palate? Whatever it was, it really did not impress at all.\n\nWe were impressed with the Rio Carnival buffet though. Did it twice and each time the food was fresh and actually had flavor to it, which are 2 things that most buffets lack. I know this is a strange thing to bring up but their onion rings were FANTASTIC! Very flavorful, hot, AND crispy on both trips. I love good onion rings. Be sure to get the ice cream. Interesting flavors and tasty. Passed on the seafood buffet as it was more money and neither of us are seafood eaters. Would spend the $ to do this one again.\n\nDidn't make it to Flamingo's buffet this trip but have in the past. It's also part of the Buffet of Buffets deal. For crepes, this is the place to go!

Seating was either outside or in the little rooms and I thought it was a lot of wasted space.  The buffet seems a lot smaller than CP and PH's too.  Wasn't thoroughly impressed here though their prime rib was good.  Caesar's Palace Lago buffet, I can't really say much since we were only there for breakfast and you can't really go super right or super wrong with breakfast.

(NOTE: you cannot buy this buffet pass online!  only at the cashier at your first buffet!  This is when your 24 hours officially start!)\n- Use your total rewards card as your admission ticket to the buffets for the remainder of your 24 hours.\n\nIt's such a good deal, you already get your money's worth after 2 buffets.  In order to maximize the deal, try to do 2 dinners, a breakfast, and a lunch.  That's what my fiance and I did.  \n\nMeal 1: Started out with a late dinner at Spice Market at PH.  The food is okay... not as great as it used to be back when PH was The Aladdin.  Food here is better than the dessert.  \n\nMeal 2: Early breakfast at 7:30am at Paris.  I've always heard this is the best breakfast buffet so there was no question about where we wanted to have breakfast.  \n\nMeal 3: Late lunch at Harrah's.  We got to enjoy both their lunch food and dinner food cuz we came so late (we were still super full from breakfast and had to eat lunch at 3pm).  This was my first time at Harrah's buffet and it was actually our favorite of all the buffets we ate at on this buffet pass!\n\nMeal 4: Dinner at Caesar's Palace.  We weren't hungry, but just went for the sake of going to a 4th buffet.  Plus we heard Caesar's had the best dessert... and that they did!  Their desserts are much more upscale in terms of presentation.  And they come in little cute serving sizes so you can definitely sample more desserts in one sitting!  Food was okay, but we didn't grab a lot of food since we were already full.\n\nSome extra tips: your 24 hours starts and ends when you officially swipe your card at the cashier.  So take into account of waiting lines!  If you have a line pass or VIP member status, then kudos to you.  But if you have to wait in line like everyone else, then plan accordingly.", 'business_id': 'cRfn_vMQ9YExuKb378CwjQ', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2011-10-11', 'type': 'review'}

For $44.99, you get 24 hour access to 7 different buffets.

With the exception of Le Village and possibly the Rio Carnival buffet, these buffets seem to be struggling on their own and wouldn't be able to draw enough people in on their own. \n\nDuring our weekend there, we hit up Le Village for lunch, Rio Carnival for dinner, Spice Market for breakfast, Flavors at Harrah's for lunch.\n\nThere were a lot of repeat items throughout these four buffets, but the standouts were pesto pasta and prime rib at Le Village, the beef and pork ribs at Carnival, and the crazy vast amounts of offerings and items at Rio Carnival. Everything else just seemed like a glorified version of Hometown Buffet. \n\nI will say that the bottomless fountain drinks and the gelato offerings were definite pluses, but nothing extremely special about these places. The Wicked Spoon [not one of the Buffet of Buffets offerings] was a definite plus way to end our weekend in Vegas, as that buffet was worth going on its own.\n\nGood idea, great concept, but mediocre to weak quality offerings.

A couple month's prior we laid out this epic BoB plan consisting of Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner1, Dinner2, and Breakfast the next day. What went down veered a bit from our itinerary.\n\nWe made it out to-\n\nLunch at the Rio - definitely impressed with the selection. Had a whole section dedicated to BBQ! YUMMM. Best thing about this buffet were the hot Asian noodle soups! Pho at a buffet while nursing your hangover from the previous night is one of the best things ever. No wait at noon on a Friday. 4.5/5 stars\n\nDinner at PH - Their Mediterranean section is really good! The layout is odd because the desserts are the first thing you see and smack in the middle of the buffet and you have to walk pretty far to get to the seafood. The crab legs are abundant but pretty salty. Nothing else really stood out to me. ~10-15 minutes wait at 6:30pm on a Friday. 3/5 stars\n\nBrunch at Flamingo - We initially wanted to do the unlimited Champagne brunch here (additional $4) but we were both waaaay too hungover to do so. Two of our friends opted for that though and the waitress definitely kept their booze coming. Loved the chocolate covered strawberries here as well as the fried chicken! Omelet station was mediocre as the chef uses WAAAAAAY too much oil. When I asked for a sunny side egg for my friend, the chef cracked it, cooked it, realized the yolk broke and threw it out! I'm not sure if I should be happy that he was an egg perfectionist or upset that he wasted food like that! 20 minutes wait at 11am on a Saturday. 3/5 stars.\n\nDisappointed that we weren't able to try the supposedly epic brunch at Le Village in Paris but perhaps next time! Each buffet itself isn't even that expensive (~$20 for lunch and $25-30 for dinner), so unless you do at least 3 you won't get your money's worth.", 'business_id': 'cRfn_vMQ9YExuKb378CwjQ', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2011-11-21', 'type': 'review'}

I took a lot of advice and guidance from fellow Yelper's reviews and my boyfriend and I went for it! \n\nDay 1: We walked to Bally's and took the free shuttle over to the Rio. We signed up for the Member's Rewards Cards and went to the World Carnival Buffet. Our 24 hours started at 8PM exactly, which is when I said we needed to start, perfect! \n\nDay 2: We missed breakfast at Paris, which is what I was really looking forward to. But who really wants to get up early when they're on vacation? We went to Planet Hollywood instead and ate an early lunch there, about 11:30AM. \n\nWe wanted play bingo at Gold Coast, which is across the street from the Rio. So we hopped on the shuttle again and headed over there. After our session of bingo, we decided to go back to the buffet at the Rio, around 4:30PM. I really wanted the won ton soup that they cook up at the Asian section. We didn't eat that much there, only one plate. We jumped back onto the shuttle back to the strip.\n\nThe last buffet we went to was Lago at Ceasar's Palace, since most Yelp reviews said they had the best dessert out of the buffets.

Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll probably opt for quality over quantity (brunch buffet at the Wynn, anyone?) but still, NO REGRETS here. BoB Thanksgiving 2011 was a fantastic decision, and a great, affordable way to see who's who as far as Vegas buffets go. Plus, it's just really fun.\n\nOne thing to be aware of and to plan for, are the lines. And if you're hitting four buffets, each with ~hour-long waits... that's a lot of hours!\n\nIn summary, I ended up hitting the buffets at Paris, Flamingo, Harrah's, and Caesars. I would rank Paris first for selection and overall fun, Caesars first for quality food and a classier atmosphere. Flamingo was easily the worst of the 4.\n\nThanksgiving Day:\n11am - Hungover-ly meander over to Paris, attempt to find the buffet, realize that oh! that huge line weaving out into the boulevard -- that's LE VILLAGE Buffet! Notice the $10/person 'Express' (read: cut the long line of grumpy hungry people), head in through the VIP double doors. Buy our Buffet of Buffet tickets as well as the $10 express pass, and we're in business! [In my mind, 2 hours is well worth $10, especially in Vegas. Plus, you can win it all back in the casinos, right??? ;-)] \n\n11:40am - The time we bought our tickets and received the BoB wristbands, meaning it's good until the same time the following day. Sit down, gorge myself. Crepe station had a line, no big, delicious. Most fun interior of the buffets we went to. Very large. Don't miss the tri-tip steaks tucked away in the corner! Creme brulee, yes please. Onward!\n\n~5pm - Try to go to Planet Hollywood and overwhelmed by the line, head to the inferior but less daunting FLAMINGO (Spice...Market?) instead. Hey, I'm down for Golden Corral once in a while, which was more or less what the Flamingo buffet reminded me of. $5/person express passes, which we picked up because 1) we had a show to get to and 2) I enjoy cutting in lines, something that never got beat out of me in elementary school I guess. Whatever. Honestly not even that hungry post-Paris, none of the entrees were memorable. Chocolate fountain was delightful. Everything else was pretty mediocre, but the BoB novelty had yet to wear off, so no complaints.\n\n~9:40pm - Fresh out of Absinthe at Caesars (was great!) where, of course, we drank the show's namesake. At this point, it seemed like a good idea to run into FLAVORS (Harrah's) before its doors close at 10pm, which was awesome. No line, grab a couple of sodas, a satisfying if generic second dinner. Yummy ice cream!\n\n10am - Brunch at CAESAR'S PALACE, which has a surprisingly low Yelp rating for how much I enjoyed it. A short wait, and onto breakfast food! Easily the smallest selection of the 4 buffets, but by far the highest quality food. It's easy to do a mediocre batch of sausage, bacon, watery scrambled eggs, pancakes and call it a brunch buffet... but everything here was really top notch, and the omelette station looked promising. \n\nBUT!! Before I could get my second helping of breakfast items, the buffet transformed before my eyes to a completely lunch buffet. I was upset at first, craving more of the breakfast foods I had so carefully sampled in round 1, but it basically ended up doubling the selection, which worked out nicely. Grrrrrreat prime rib and ribeye. Hearty mac n cheese (the kind that's topped with a thick layer of crunchy bits, none of that watery shit). I'll save the rest for my proper Lago review since this is waxing long, but this was a nice way to end my BoB sprint-- with a smaller selection of some really choice items in a more luxurious, calm environment. Dessert bar was a little depressing in the sense that I was so full at this point, I could only admire the delectable selection of beautiful sweets before me.\n\nConclusion: BoB is a great way to invest your time and money, especially if you aren't too familiar with Vegas. You get acquainted with the mood of each casino, and by the end, you'll be a Vegas buffet expert. If you're willing to spend a little more, you can even skip the lines. Think of it as an adventure, don't take it too seriously, and you'll definitely have a good time! But it's not something I would do more than once.", 'business_id': 'cRfn_vMQ9YExuKb378CwjQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2011-11-29', 'type': 'review'}

Some of the food was just so-so, but like with any buffet, the first plate or two is spent just finding what you do and don't like, and from then on it's loading up on the good stuff! Right? The gelato bar was great too. Probably tied for my favorite buffet overall.\n\nLe Village: Zero wait, got there right at 7am.\n\n    Best. Breakfast. Ever. Seriously, the best I have ever had. And I have had thousands upon thousands of breakfasts! The shining star l think is the prime rib hash. Just incredible. Juicy chunks of prime rib, shredded potatoes, mushrooms, onions and peppers..... Heaven on a plate. Also the made-fresh crepe station is a nice touch. I almost said made-to-order, but that's inaccurate since the crepe chef has to 'follow the menu'. No big deal to me, but there was a lady that was quite upset that he couldn't shove every filling on the board into her crepe. Pretty funny I thought. I got the mixed berry crepe and it was fantastic. I don't even like berries!!\n\nSpice Market: Less than 10 minute wait.\n\n     We had lunch here and in my opinion, it was a slightly not-as-good version of the Carnival World. I mean, it was good. The tandoori chicken was great and the fajitas were good too. It just wasn't 'blow me away' good. You know?\n\nLago: Zero wait.\n\n    Tried it for dinner. Just horrible. Plain and simple. I cannot stress enough how bad this buffet was. Yes, the selection was limited. Reading reviews on Yelp had me prepared for this going in. But the selections they did put forth were just plain disgusting. The ONLY thing that was even edible was their cheese ravioli. It wasn't even great, just the only thing that I was able to take more than one bite of. Baked mac and cheese, tasted like noodles with a light spray of butter and no cheese. Horrible attempt at an asian station I think would offend anyone with asian blood in their veins. Avoid at all costs. So we left, hurried across the street back to Planet Hollywood to get in for dinner there before the pass expired.\n\nSpice Market: 30 minute wait\n\n     The same as lunch, plus some pre-cut crab legs. Not really my cup of tea. The meat was fully exposed since they were cut the long way. Also very, very salty. I understand being a buffet that crab legs are served cold, but this was a miss. Very cold, very salty crab meat just wasn't for me. After the debacle at Lago, my stomach was sort of hurting anyway. l managed to shove one plate of various bits down (hello again, tandoori chicken...) and pretty much just ate some desserts for dinner. It was good. Carnival World is better I think. If not for that damned tandoori chicken, I don't think Spice Market would ever see me again. You can get everything they offer done just a little better at Rio, plus a better dessert bar.\n\nSummary:\n\n  Rio takes the #1 spot for overall greatness of just about everything.\n  Paris was a tough contender, but I only ate there for breakfast.\n  Spice Market was decent, but sort of a lower quality version of other buffets.\n  Lago, I would rate 10th out of 4 if at all possible. This place should be shut down.\n\nWould definitely do this deal again, even if I had to pay for it. I wanted to try Flavors at Harrah's but they were closed during the time l was there. I wouldn't dare to try Imperial Palace after what I had read, and sort of felt the same about Flamingo's buffet.", 'business_id': 'cRfn_vMQ9YExuKb378CwjQ', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2011-12-21', 'type': 'review'}

Le Village Buffet at Paris\nI don't know why this buffet is rated so high, but it was my least favorite by far.

Just accept it.\n-if you are with the above person, bring headphones.\n-if you want to eat as much as you humanly can at every buffet, ease up on the protein; you will be lugging a 20-pound frankenmeat in your tummy for the next 2 days and will be severely constipated \n-if you wanna hit all 7 buffets, prepare to make it an all-day event and get a bus pass to haul you from hotel to hotel.\n\nHappy eating!", 'business_id': 'cRfn_vMQ9YExuKb378CwjQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2012-01-03', 'type': 'review'}

If you get a players card it is $45 but remember in order to get the discount each adult will need to get a players card. We managed to have 4 meals and ate at 3 different buffets.\nDay 1:\n-6:00pm We started off with dinner at Planet Hollywoods Spice Market Buffet.\n  Overall: 4 stars\n  Line: ~30 min\n  Ambiance: Decor is simple and modern. Movie posters on the wall :)\n  Buffet set up: really nice and easy to follow\n  Food:The food here was really delicious. It was flavorful and they had a really big variety of foods including Mediterranean, Asian, Seafood, Mexican, and American. Some of my favorite dishes was the warm crab legs, prime rib, skewered tandoori chicken and beef. Their deserts were to die for, especially for me who has a huge sweet tooth. They had a crepe making station, cotton candy, yummy creme brulee, and don't be fooled by the soft serve machine. I thought it was just regular ice cream but nope it was vanilla custard soft serve which had a really thick creamy texture.\n\nDay 2:\n-9:00 Le Village Buffet at Paris Paris\n  Overall: 4 stars\n   Line: ~40 min\n   Ambiance: Cozy and cute. Decorated true to its theme, like a Parisan village\n   Buffet set up: This is why I I couldnt award it 5 stars. The buffet set up was very muddled and it was difficult to find things. Some food items were somewhat hidden behind lines of people waiting for omelets and crepes. Also these stations had extremely long lines. It was alot less organized than Planet Hollywood and other buffets I have been to.\n   Food: Food was really good. I am not really a big breakfast person but I really enjoyed that even though the spread was your typical breakfast foods they had a variety of each food. For example they had several different types of sausages, I tried andouille which was really good.I also tried the banana nutella crepe with candied walnuts which was sugary bliss. Make sure you have the rosemary red potatoes!\n\nWe planned on having Caesars for lunch but unfortunately the information desk told us the buffet had closed down a few days ago. This was a little ridiculous since Caesars was listed on most of the ads and was even on our wristbands. Nevertheless we took it in our stride and decided to try Harrahs.\n\n-1:00 Flavors Buffet at Harrahs\n  Overall: 2 stars\n  Line: ~20 min which was really ridiculous because the restaurant was not packed at all. \n  Ambiance:Simple but clean\n  Buffet set up: Easy to follow however alot of the sauces were unaccessable. Also alot of the deserts are behind glass so you have to ask an attendant.\n Food: None of the dishes were exceptional but nothing was bad either... Cookies and cream gelato was really good though.\n\n-5:00 Spice Market Buffet Round 2!\n Yep it was that good! We decided to go again so we could end our buffet experience on a good note and it was 100% worth it. I got to really enjoy all the dishes I liked the previous night. Best part was there was no line when we arrived!\n\nThing to keep in mind:\n-There are lines so make sure you go with people you like, anybody the is a wet blanket or picky eater will ruin the experience. I was lucky that everyone I was with were down for anything so it was really fun.\n-To get the most bang for your buck have a late dinner one night and then have breakfast, lunch and dinner the next day. Remember it's 24 hours.\n-Be open minded and just have fun with it!

(I've just spent $44 in in buffets folks, and still have 12 hours to go - this is a bargain).\n\nThen it was Le Village @ Paris for breakfast the next day.  They had stellar prime rib hash and stewed breakfast fruits.

We\'re both fatties, so the B.o.B. seemed like the obvious choice to spend our weekend. Plus, you save a lot of money, because for $55 / person (I am not a Total Rewards member, and this amount includes tax) you can pack in 4 meals and "snack" buffet trips.\n\n(1) The start of our B.o.B. adventure was at the Carnival World Buffet in Rio for dinner. The only one off the strip, and this particular buffet is loaded with childhood memories (and a huge food selection)... this was the one buffet we always had to hit on our fambam Vegas trips. As a child, I didn\'t know any better,  but the food tastes pretty crappy now.\n\n(2) The next day, we dined on The Strip. Since we stayed at Vdara, it only made sense to have breakfast across the street at The Spice Market in Planet Hollywood... aptly named, because all the dishes were very well seasoned. \n\n(3) Immediately after, we hauled our filled tummies to le Village Buffet at Paris for lunch. Luckily, I didn\'t realize Champagne Brunch was being served, so the hour-long line gave us time to finish digesting our breakfast. The Champagne Brunch (which normally costs $27) alone justified the price of the pass... 2 brunches and we\'ve eaten our money\'s worth! and you can\'t skip out on the Crepe bar... that was Chris K.\'s favorite part of B.o.B. I know I drank a good amount of champagne, but my flute stayed full the entire course of our meal. Lesson learned at le Village: DON\'T CHUG THE CHAMPAGNE!! It is a choking hazard and is a mistake not to be repeated! \n\n(4) Our final buffet was Cafe Lago at Caesar\'s Palace. Although it was impossible to find (there were no signs directing us to the entrance) and the line to get in didn\'t move (we missed our 24 hour mark by 10 minutes... thankfully we were still allowed in), the food here tasted the best. All the other buffets offered prime rib, but Cafe Lago additionally gave us the option of herb-crusted flank steak (super savory!!). I went back 3 rounds for the flank steak, and even had it as my dessert. Compared to the other participating buffets, this cafe has classier-looking, artistic food displays and seemed more clean, but the selection of food items is less extensive.\n\nI am so glad to finally check off B.o.B. on my Vegas To-Do list. Worth every penny!

We got out passes late (around 8 pm) on a Thursday night at the Spice Market buffet. We were excited for the concept here because we like to try international foods and are a fan of the cuisines offered here. Unfortunately, these were nothing like what we get from actual Indian/Middle Eastern/etc restaurants. If you're not very adventurous or into authentic foods but want to feel like you're broadening your food horizons then this could be your place. I'd say skip it.\n\nWe had our next meal in the morning for brunch at Lago in Caesar's Palace. A very small buffet for Vegas standards, but everything was done well. The bacon was cooked nice and crispy, not all limp and fatty like at a lot of breakfast buffets. They had classic American staples like pasta, macaroni and cheese, chicken wings and more. They also had all you can eat cold crab legs, made to order omelets and eggs, and a fabulous meat carving station. There was prime rib with jus, carved chicken, and ham with sauces for each. The dessert station was amazing - all manner of little cookies and cakes, mousse cups, chocolates, and a sizable no sugar added/sugar free dessert section. There was a super detailed gingerbread house for the holidays in the center of the station (our visit was about 2 weeks before Christmas). I highly recommend this buffet.\n\nWe were left so full from this buffet that we didn't end up going to lunch that day. Instead, we skipped right to dinner at the Paris La Village Buffet. I had been excited for this buffet because I love the concept and had heard favorable reviews about it. We went around 7:15, to make sure we had enough time to get through the line without our passes expiring. They had a good selection of foods, as well as a crepe station. I was just not that impressed with the food overall. The meats were kind of dry and a bit flavorless, the desserts were mediocre. I'd give this buffet a try again, mostly because it seems like it has potential and others gave it good reviews, but I would probably go earlier to see if the food was better quality.\n\nAll in all, it's a great value if you can make it to at least 2 dinners. Obviously the value is better the more meals you have in 24 hours, so when I go back to Vegas I'm going to try to eat more meals but in smaller amounts to sample the other buffets on the list.", 'business_id': 'cRfn_vMQ9YExuKb378CwjQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2012-05-04', 'type': 'review'}

Went to Vegas weekend before last and purchased this at 11:30am at the Paris brunch. That was probably the best meal, though I keep going back and forth in my head between there and the Carnival World(Rio) dinner. Besides those 2, we also went to Flavor's(Harrah's) for what was supposed to have been a snack(okay, maybe a little gluttony in order to maximize the use of our 24 hour pass) but turned into 2 plates. I was pleasantly surprised with this one. Then the next morning on our way out, we hit Spice Market(Planet Hollywood) for breakfast/brunch. You can skip that one. I wished we did and went to Rio instead, but unfortunately I let my curiosity get the best of me because I had never been there before. We didn't make it to the others(missing the Imperial Palace was intentional), but 3 of the 4 we did hit were great.

I\'d pass on this one. The selection isn\'t that great. If there\'s no line and you want a quick breakfast then ok stop here. \n\nWe also had a late dinner here since they close at 11pm. The selection isn\'t so bad. The dessert here was blah. It\'s all cupcakes. Creative flavors. But if you\'re not into cupcakes it\'s pretty lame. I took small bites of interesting flavors. I have to say that they were moist at least considering the large batches they have to make. There\'s a sad selection of crab legs. They also had cocktail shrimp. The selections were American, Asian, Mediterranean, Italian and Mexican. \n\nNext, Lunch at Paris buffet. This was really good. The coffee is good and their selection is extensive. Sadly, the made to order crepe station was a disappointment. I was told that they\'d only make crepes off their savory or sweet menu and none were appealing to me but I settled on the nutella and banana which sucked. The fruit toppings are not fresh. The bananas were pre-mixed in this overly sweet jelly thing that was wrong. I\'d rather pay for a Jean Philippe crepe. Also I\'ve read reviews that their chocolate croissants was awesome. Wrong again. All the croissants were hard and not flaky or buttery. Again I\'d rather pay for a Jean Philippe almond or chocolate croissant which is well worth the calories. Everything else was good. Their salad bar is fresh. Fruits were fresh. Cheese selection was yummy. \n\nWe also ended the pass with breakfast at Paris which was good. French toast, pancakes, coffee all yummy. Omelette station guy makes big omelets with lots of toppings. I\'d pay for the breakfast alone, good bang for your buck. I think $15.99? \n\nSince on the website it says you gotta check out Flamingo for their asian food selections the bf chose to check this place out. This place was de-press-ing. We literally sat down for 10 mins and left. The food looked wrong. That\'s all i have to say about Flamingo.\n\nLast but not least....Bacchanal at CP. This is the reason why I wanted to do the pass. Extra $15 for the newest and best buffet? Ok deal. WELL I apparently read the fine print wrong. I thought you only had to pay $15 to upgrade the pass, giving unlimited access to the buffet. I even asked this when the girl rang us up. Specifically I said "So once we upgrade we can come back and eat again whenever?" And her answer was "Yes" So I\'m thinking great...I\'ll pay $15 extra and we\'ll go a couple more times before the 24hrs is up. So when we went it was at 4pm on a Thursday and a perfect time to sample the food because it was not busy at all. The plan was to fully indulge later. So we tried a few things, which were pretty good but we were so stuffed from earlier we didn\'t eat a lot. I was really looking forward to the dessert because I\'ve read so many good reviews about it so I decided to wait to enjoy it. I just went to check it out and it made me so excited for later. We just got a gelato to go in a chocolate and peanut dipped cone which was pretty good. So come later when we were hungry and ready to have a late dinner, we get in line and tell them we have the pass with upgrade already. The guy scans our player\'s card and says "$32" and I\'m thinking no we already paid to upgrade and this is when he tells us "No, you pay every time you eat here" Yeah I was pretty pissed and disappointed. At least we didn\'t wait in the long ass line for dinner when we had walked by earlier. I don\'t plan on paying again for this buffet because the food wasn\'t spectacular, extensive selection yes but omg delicious..no. The asian food was ok. The seafood is pretty good and fresh. I guess I\'ll never get to try their dessert unless we go with family and they pay. haha.', 'business_id': 'cRfn_vMQ9YExuKb378CwjQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2012-10-30', 'type': 'review'}

Most people would probably be able to get 2-3 meals within those 24 hours. \nWithout it, a buffet would cost anywhere from $30-$60. \nI know that some of the other yelp reviewers say that you have to eat fast and time it right but I think that as long as you get two meals in, you've received your money's worth.\nIn a way, it's a lot like getting a season pass at an amusement park. Even if you go three times in that whole year, you've spent less than you would if you had bought three individual tickets so it's well worth it.\n\nI've only had a chance to go to the Rio and Paris buffets and I am absolutely satisfied. \nThe Rio one is perhaps the bigger of the two and it has a variety of foods including pho and wonton soup for my asian food craves.\n\nI have to say I was a little disappointed by the Paris buffet. It had a lot less food than I had expected but if you really love crepes and dessert, this is where to go. Also, the service is great and the people are friendly.\n\nAs for tips,\nI recommend getting the wristband as late as you can before closing so that you can have a more flexible schedule for dinner the next day. \nAlso, it is never too late. Your wristband lasts until the minute it reaches 24 hours. I remember the last time that I went, my wristband was supposed to expire at 7 pm. My boyfriend and I rushed to the Paris buffet only to find a super long line. It was 6:59 but I refused to give up so I went to the customs desk to the left of the line and told the friendly lady at the desk that my wristband is about to expire but I'd like to squeeze in one last meal. She smiled and gave me a receipt for two at the buffet and told me to show the cashier at the line my receipt and proceed to the line to be seated.\nI didn't want to wait in the same line for the cashier where people were waiting to pay for their meal so I skipped to the front and told the girl showing people to seats that I already had my receipt and asked if she could seat me. \n\nShe asked if everyone in my party already paid and I said yes so she took my boyfriend and me right in.\nSo we basically saved 45 minutes of standing in line and managed to squeeze in a meal with one minute to spare.\n\nAlso, if you happen to walk past a buffet while you're going about your day on the strip, and the buffet has no line going in, feel free to stop by and grab a gelato or a cheesecake. Because you can. So there.\n\nI have yet to try the other buffets on the list but I heard that the Planet Hollywood one is superb. Either way, the great thing about buffets is that there will most likely be food that you like. Remember, a buffet is not for eating as much as you can; it's to give you a variety of foods to choose from. Don't like the food you chose? pick another! wish you had more? go get some more!\n\nOh, and the wristbands are waterproof in case you were wondering so don't go showering with your arm hanging outside your tub in the hotel.", 'business_id': 'cRfn_vMQ9YExuKb378CwjQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2012-12-11', 'type': 'review'}

We ended up having 4 buffets. Overall, we felt satisfied for our stomach.\n\nOur stops:\n1) Bacchanal (without eating... see above)\n2) Flavors at Harrah's\n3) Paradise Garden at Flamingo\n4) Le Village at Paris\n5) Spice Market at Planet Hollywood\n\nAt 12noon, we arrived at Caesars and were ready for the long long long queue. We saw the express line and was about to pay 20 bucks more to skip the line. HOWEVER, they told us there was a 2 hour limits for holiday.... Seriously?!? Even Wynn didn't do it... How come you can limit your guest for 2 hours for buffet! AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, they will not be included in the Buffet of Buffets pass because of holiday. Didn't even mention it on website or line..... So if you want to skip the line and eat there, it costs 80 bucks per person.... NO WAY! 0 Stars for Bacchannl!\n\n\nFlavors at Harrah's: 3.5\nWe arrived there at 2:30 for lunch. After having a mess in Bacchannl, I was just craving for food! Thinking that there was no pass in holiday, I still wanted to have buffet. When I arrived the counter, they told us that the buffet passes were still on and only Bacchanal was excluded! YAYYYYYY. We then paid $107 for 2 people including tips and tax. The options for food were a bit limited but they did have a good selection of desserts. For only 30 mins of waiting, I will give it a 3.5 stars. Recommend it for a quick late lunch/dinner.\n\n\nParadise Garden at Flamingo: 3.5\nArrived around 5:30 after Flavors. The atmosphere was a lot better than Flavors. And they DID have make-to-order crepes and chocolate fountain here! Other than these, the selections of food was pretty similar to Flavors. The queue was also pretty short which only took us about 15 mins to go in. The queue was still short when we came out at 7:30pm. Overall, I will also give it a 3.5 stars.\n\n\nLe Village at Paris: 5 (Must-go breakfast)\nWe LOVED it! The atmosphere and surrounding environment were awesome. Food selections were a lot more than Flavors and Paradise. We didn't expect that much after going to Flavors and Paradise. We will DEFINITELY come again in the future. We came here at 8 and there was a 15 mins wait... when we came out at 9:45am, there was around 45mins -1 hour wait! So come early and get prepared for a big, satisfying meal! Make-to-order crepes again :] Just go and you will love it!\n\n\nSpice Market at Planet Hollywood: 4.5\nOur last stop for BoB at 11:45am. Queue was not too long since it was not yet lunch-time. Crab legs were cut off so they made it easier for you. AND they did have Oysters which we couldn't find in any others buffets including Wynn! They also had cotton candy as well. Food selections were not so bad: they have Mexican, Asian, Soup, Mediterranean, Mid-eastern, salad, seafood......\n\n\nTIPS:\n1) Eat at embarrassing time (7:30, 11:30, 2pm, 5:30pm, 8pm): in this way, you don't waste your time in queue\n2) Take a look at the map and plan ahead: you don't want to waste your time on walking around... try to have two meal in surrounding areas\n3) Dont eat like the end of the world for EVERY buffets: you think it's worth it... but if you get the buffet passes.. you still have many buffets to go!!

Mongolian-style grill in Asian section.\nDinner at Planet Hollywood (Spice Market): Waited here the longest and was the most disappointed.\nBreakfast at Flamingo (Paradise Garden): Crisp waffles in the shape of playing card suits\n\nTIP: Go to the buffets at odd times. We ate breakfast both days around 7:30 am and got right in. Lunch was at 11:30 and dinner was at 4:30. We spent a good chunk of the day just eating and getting to the buffets. I wouldn't recommend this if you plan your schedule down to the minute and don't give much time for food.", 'business_id': 'cRfn_vMQ9YExuKb378CwjQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2013-01-02', 'type': 'review'}

For the simple fact that we ate a restaurant in Vegas where a cheeseburger was $15 you can see that it is going to be pricey to dine out here no matter which way you do it (unless you grab fast food or a slice of pizza). So you pay $54.99 on the spot or I believe $47.99 if you buy the buffet of buffet when you book your hotel, but either way you are saving a ton of money. If you do what we did and just buy the pass for dinner one night then you have 24 hours to eat as many times as you want so we were able to get 4 meals out of it (breakfast, lunch, and 2 dinners). You get a wrist band which is kind of annoying because you have to wear it for 24 hours but it's definitely worth it. Just avoid the typical meal times or else you will be waiting in the lines forever. We did breakfast around 10, lunch around 2:30 and dinner around 8 and did not have to wait but a few minutes in a very short line (shorter than I have waited to be seated at some restaurants back home). With the buffet of buffet you can eat at 6 different buffets (Harrah's, Planet Hollywood's, Flamingo's,  Imperial Palace's, Rio's, and Paris Las Vegas' buffets) for the price you paid and if you want to eat at  the Bacchanal Buffet at Caesar's Palace you pay $15 more. We chose to stay at the Spice Market Buffet because it was convenient and we liked it so much for all of our meals but next time I'd be willing to try others.", 'business_id': 'cRfn_vMQ9YExuKb378CwjQ', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2013-01-07', 'type': 'review'}

Well, not entirely though.  I had a little bit of misunderstanding on how the pricing worked with the higher end buffets that are offered as an upgrade (Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars Palace and Village Seafood Buffet at Rio).\n\nSo here's how it goes for Total Rewards members like me:  for $47.99 you get 24 hour access to The Carnival World Buffet at Rio, Le Village Buffet at Paris, Spice Market Buffet at Planet Hollywood, The Paradise Garden Buffet at Flamingo, Flavors Buffet at Harrah's, and The Emperor's Buffet at The Quad Resort (formerly Imperial Palace).  Here's the part that I misunderstood, you also get access to Bacchanal Buffet and Village Seafood Buffet for an upgrade of $15 PER VISIT.  The PER VISIT part is the where I got things mixed up as I thought it was a one time upgrade fee only.  \n\nWith that in mind, and the fact that I had only intended to use the BoB strictly for Bacchanal since it was new and I wanted to try it for 24 hours, I ended up spending more than I expected out of this.  But that's completely my fault for not reading the fine print. \n\nI'll get into details with how my sessions at Bacchanal went in a separate review.  However after going though two buffet meals, I remembered why I stopped doing buffets as I realized that I can't stuff myself silly like I did during my college years.  So even though I still had time for breakfast the next morning, I didn't have the appetite for it and just omitted it.  I was in major food exhaustion.  LOL\n\nFor what it's worth, I still think the Buffet of Buffets is a great deal if you know how to plan ahead:  knowing breakfast, lunch, and dinner times, knowing locations of buffets, and also going with the idea that since you've got 24 hour access there is no need to stuff yourself silly.  Good planning of all those factors can help you get the most out of your 24 hour pass.", 'business_id': 'cRfn_vMQ9YExuKb378CwjQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2013-01-21', 'type': 'review'}

They had a huge decent sized buffet. The crab legs were pre cut yay!!! They had a great selection and the prime rib was tender and delicious! This place also had indian cuisine. (15 min wait in line). The buffet is located downstairs from the main casino floor. \n\nSat 10am: Paris: Heaven. Definitely my favorite buffet. Im a potatoes kinda girl so I was very, very happy with the different selections of hash browns, fingerlings, etc.. So while I was eating my breakfast they were in process of switching to brunch. They had bacon, different egg dishes, different kinds of sausage, quiche, and more. This was my fave buffet and yes i\'d come around this time again so I could get the variety of foods. (The wait was apprx 20 min). I loved the decor. It looks like we\'re sitting outside, but really inside. Really, really, cool. The buffet is located in the back of the casino if you\'re coming in from the strip.\n\nSat 2pm: Harrahs: yuk, no line at all. That was the sign and I didn\'t listen to myself. Don\'t waste your time. This is your Hometown Buffet under a different name. Really weird thing is that for dessert, it sits behind a refrigerator case, so you have to wait for an employee to be available to give you the dessert. This is a fail. The buffet is located right inside the casino as you walk in from the strip.\n\nSat 7pm: Rio: this buffet is 3rd fave. This buffet goes on forever. It has the most selection. When I saw that the crab legs were not pre cut I was going to leave and try to make it back to Planet Hollywood, but they had a pho soup station and pad thai. So it was good and I was happy again. There\'s a lot of food from around the world to choose from. If you\'re driving, try to park in front of the hotel in the self parking that\'s west of the entrance. The door to the buffet is right there. It\'s nearby where the shuttle drops you off. \n\nIf you love to eat then yes, this is the thing to do. Totally worth the money.

I saw the buffet offer of $49 but didn\'t realize that that was for weekdays.  Weekends (same food) is $70 or $65 if you have the Total Rewards card which I thought was pretty pricey.  That was until I found out what they were charging these days if you pay as you go...\n\nOn Saturday night I decided to go to Paris buffet since reading the reviews I didn\'t get a sense that the other buffets (other than Bacchanal) were so good.  At 9pm there was a 40 minute wait.  The buffet was good but not spectacular.  My gold standard was the Bellagio buffet which for many years is what I considered the best quality buffet and variety anywhere.  The Paris buffet (Le Village) to me doesn\'t come close.  It didn\'t matter very much since my goal was to prep up for Caesar\'s buffet.  Normal price at on the weekends for Paris is $37.  Personally, I don\'t think it is worth it.  There are lots of non buffets that I would spend less and eat much higher quality food.\n\nSunday morning, I went to Carnival World at Rio.  There was no wait here at 9:30am  This was just ok also - so I ended up eating 1 full plate and left there.  The normal charge for this "brunch" is $32.  That\'s crazy.  I would not pay that for this food.  $20, maybe.  There wasn\'t much breakfast food here and more lunch/dinner choices.\n\nAn hour later, I went back to Paris and waited about an hour at noon.  I forgot to check but I believe the brunch price is on par with Carnival.  Surprisingly, other than an omelet station and a few other breakfast items, the choices were the same I had last night at the dinner buffet - give or take a few things.  A few of the things (I especially remember the creme br\xfbl\xe9e) I am sure it was left over from the night before as the burnt sugar that is supposed to be crispy on this was as soft as the custard.  Not fresh and not good.  I ate just 1 plate here.  The waitress was puzzled why I would supposedly spend $30 for 1 plate but perhaps she forgot about the 24hr unlimited buffet pass.  \n\nThis evening, I went to the Bacchanal.  I heard a lot of good things about this place and honestly - the reason why I came to Vegas.  Instead of the $15 surcharge to eat here that was mentioned in a few posts, I was surprised to find out it was increased to a $25 surcharge a few weeks ago.  I wasn\'t too happy as that made the deal slightly less attractive as I normally wouldn\'t go eat a buffet for breakfast.  Still, it is what it is.  Dinner without the 24hr. offer is a staggering $57.  Vegas is sure getting pricey these days.  After a 5 minute wait at 6pm, I walk in and instantly notice how modern and hip the place is.  It has definitely lived up to the hype.  Going over the food, I am giddy - everything looks to be high end, food that is expertly crafted and made as though as I was in a high end NYC restaurant.  The food was just exceptional.  I can\'t find good enough words for the quality and the variety.  To me, this blows Bellagio away and is certainly my new standard for the best buffet out there.  The cold shrimp was a type I have never had before.  The texture is very special and it was extremely flavorful.  I can\'t explain how good and large these were.  The meats were tender and flavorful.  I would not do this normally at a buffet but they had these tiny hamburger sliders and I had to have one.  It was superb - almost as good as Kobe burgers I had in Daniel\'s (Michigan 3 star restaurant).  For those that are familiar with Japanese Mochi ice cream treats, you don\'t find these in restaurants because of the expense.  Well, welcome to unlimited Mochi and Italian gelato.  I am floored.  I had a crepe and the fruits were very fresh as well as the heavenly handmade whipped cream.  The desserts were crazy good and I\'m glad I started out with desserts FIRST so I could really enjoy them without being overly full.  No kidding - I probably ate between 4000-5000 calories + in 90 minutes.  It was insane and I\'m sure my body will punish me in the coming days.   When I left there at 7:30, there was about a 60-90 minute wait so I\'m glad I got there early on a supposedly slow Sunday.  There was no 2hr max sitting as mentioned by someone else but you know what, 2hrs should be plenty.  You don\'t want to eat till you explode\n\nSo, would I do this 24hr buffet deal again?  Probably not.  I don\'t think I need to gain 10lbs in 24hrs.  It\'s not really enjoyable to engorge in mega calories as much as you can do in 1 day.  I Definitely would not pay the weekend rate again.  Weekdays for $49, perhaps.\n\nHowever, I not only would gladly pay the rate for Bacchanal, but I would spend more and recommend only that buffet (and Bellagio) in vegas.', 'business_id': 'cRfn_vMQ9YExuKb378CwjQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2013-02-24', 'type': 'review'}

Fresh oysters were meh, although the snow crabs and shrimp were quite good.  We had a very friendly waiter who served us drinks.  In terms of ambiance, this was probably the best buffet.  Wait was 20 minutes at 5:30 p.m.on a weekday.\n\nWe went to Harrah\'s at 9:45 p.m.on  the same night.  They close at 10:00 p.m. So what was left was stale and and unappetizing.  However, I had one of the best shu-mai which was hidden under a bamboo basket which nobody knew was there.  Here again, the waiter was friendly and although we did not eat much, it was an okay meal.\n\nWe stood in line for 30 minutes the next day for breakfast at Le Village Buffet at Paris. They serve OJ\'s in a large glass and a pot of coffee to accompany your meal.  Good selection of breakfast fare, but I was impressed with their fresh fruits ~ sweetest pineapples and strawberries and juicy cantaloupes and melons.\n\nWe ventured to the Emperor\'s buffet at the Quad Resort, but found out that their buffet is for lunch only.  We also checked out Spice Market at PH and after reading the yelp reviews, we decided to go back to Le Village at Paris for dinner for our fourth buffet as time was ticking by.\n\nAgain we had a very friendly waitress at Le Village and we enjoyed our last dinner buffet.\n\nWould I do this deal again?  Yes, maybe if you choose the kind of foods that you like and do not indulge in the "extras" and if you don\'t mind waiting in lines.

Fairly epic looking on the poster. Piqued my curiosity. \n\nThen a bit later you'll see another sign or maybe something in a magazine.\n\nDecided to go for it, seemed like a lot of options and from the photos some of them looked good.\n\nThere during the week, so it cost $49 with the players card which you can get free of charge, you do need to provide ID. I figured it gets you a few other things and you need to keep a wristband on for the 24 hours if you don't have the card. Two of the buffet options have an extra charge,  seafood at Rio and the Bachanal at Caesar's Palace. From other reviews the one at Caeasar's Palace sounds pretty good, but didn't make it there.\n\n\nWas staying at Rio, so went to the world buffet there first. It was decent. Very friendly waiters with the drinks. A lot of variety. Included prime rib, sushi, and some other things. The sushi seemed a little better there than at the other places. They had gelato in the dessert selection which I liked. Was also pretty hungry for the first buffet, so ate quite a bit. \n\nThought about doing the seafood buffet at Rio, but ended up not doing that. The buffet at Paris seemed like it could be good.\n\nSo headed there before going to a show and..... there was a huge line! Didn't really have enough time to wait in the line and make it to the show (7:00) on time, but it was open until 10:00 so we came back at about 8:45 and got in the line. Not so bad, but it was still maybe a 20 minute wait at that time.\n\nThe wait seemed to indicate it would be good though, so seemed worthwhile. Once we got in, there were a number of things different than the Rio buffet. Crabs legs, freshly made crepes, antipasto, a little Mediterranean, among other things. Definitely a more European lean in a number of things. Creme Brullet was very good. Salad bar was a bit different than other places. They also had prime rib. Overall, one of my favorites.\n\nMost of the buffets (except Rio) are pretty close together - Paris, Quad, Bally's, Planet Hollywood, Flamingo Harrah's, and Caesar's Palace.\n\nThe next day we figured we could go by a few of them and check them out.\n\nHad one plate at Harrah's. It was okay, not especially exciting.\n\nThe location within the building of the buffets was a little different at certain places. A few were out of the way.\n\nAt Paris it's on ground floor, very popular.\n\nA couple others were tucked away and that seemed to make them less visited and not quite as good.\n\nWalked by the Quad and it didn't seem too exciting, not a lot of people there.\n\nFigured going back to Paris was an option.\n\nBut then went to the Flamingo. Immediately it had a nice ambiance. There were flamingos and water outside on the ground floor and even a black swan.\n\nThe food was quite good. They had a freshly made quesadilla bar going (afternoon). Seems they use that for crepes at night. Had prime rib there which was also good. As well as some seafood. Tried a crawfish, which I wasn't wild about, but not sure if I usually am. Had sushi which was all right. Fresh fruit there included watermelon slices.\n\nLots of pastries available, had a bite of one, but didn't really like it. Chocolate fondue was pretty good.\n\nDrank hot tea. Servers were friendly.\n\nDidn't end up seeing Bally's, but looked into the spice market buffet at Planet Hollywood and it seemed pretty good. Would maybe check that out another time.\n\nOverall, a good deal if you're down to eat a variety of food and like to eat. Think about your choices though since you're probably not going to make it to all of them. Also realize that a number of them are close together, so you can check them out and continue to a different one if you're not interested.", 'business_id': 'cRfn_vMQ9YExuKb378CwjQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2013-10-08', 'type': 'review'}

On a weekday, it's $50 (with total rewards card; $55 without the card) for 24 hours of food!! if you have rewards credits from gambling, you can use it to pay for your buffet! I used mine and got my gluttony pass for FREE!! On the weekend, the rate goes up... $75. the timer starts the very minute you buy it. I suggest starting at dinner like I did to get the most for your money. I probably wouldn't also do this deal on a weekend as the main thing I notice about the weekend is champagne with your meal and since I don't drink that, I do not want to pay extra for it. \n\nAnyways, the buffets included are (1) Spice Market @ Planet Hollywood, (2) Le Village buffet @ Paris, (3) Flavors @ Harrahs, (4) World Carnival @ Rio, and (5) Paradise Garden @ Flamingo. For a SURCHARGE of $10 you can eat at Village Seafood Buffet - TOTALLY worth it!!! For a SURCHARGE of $15, you can eat BREAKFAST at Bacchanal buffet @ Caesers; for a SURCHARGE of $20, you can eat LUNCH at Bacchanal buffet @ Caesers; for a SURCHARGE of $25, you can eat DINNER at Bacchanal buffet @ Caesers. \n\nIf you want to eat at Caeser's, which is a VERY good buffet by the way, I suggest just eating there WITHOUT the buffet of buffets pass. I think the surcharges for Caeser's is too high, and that's probably due to how popular it is at the moment. Lunch there is $30 on a weekday and $50 for dinner... go during lunch and time it for dinner. The only difference I noticed with cold crab legs...\n\nAnyways. it IS worth it to add the Village Seafood buffet. For my 24 hours of gluttony, I ate dinner at Spice Market ($30), breakfast at Le Village ($20), and dinner again at Village Seafood Buffet ($40). I wanted to really fit in a lunch, but woke up late and ended up having a late breakfast that didn't end will about noon already... otherwise I would had gotten more for my money's worth. In the end, I spent $60 for $90 worth of buffet... and if I had woke up in time and timed my meals better, I would had even gotten more of my money's worth!\n\nI think this is a great deal for food!! Since you have the pass, go during off times to avoid lines and not waste time waiting... Next time I do this, I'm going to get in 4 meals!!! It's also nice because if you are craving a snack, you can also just stop into a buffet, grab some drinks and dessert just because!\n\nIf you eat like a bird however, then this is not the deal for you!", 'business_id': 'cRfn_vMQ9YExuKb378CwjQ', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2013-11-27', 'type': 'review'}

You know you want to!\n\nWe started our 24 hour time period with a late Thanksgiving dinner and managed to hit all 5 buffets before the time was up- Insane but true!  We had to pay the $75 holiday price, but felt the cost was totally worth it for 4 meal and a snack.  \n\nHere is my opinion on each of the buffets:\n1.  Spice Market (Planet Hollywood)- Waited an hour and 15 minutes on Thanksgiving night and were very underwhelmed, but that may have been because of the mad crush of people.\n2.  Flamingo Buffet- A surprisingly good breakfast buffet despite the cheapness of the casino its in.  Lots of made for you items, a wickedly long desert area considering it was breakfast, and a lot of really good food\n3.  Flavors (Harrahs)- Went for lunch and found it to be in 3rd place out of the 5.  Hot food items were ok, but has a ton of interesting desert options.\n4.  Paris Buffet- We went here for our midafternoon snack.  We really only intended to eat crepes.  We did take a look around and still didn't find a ton that looked interesting if we had been eating a full meal.  A little to fancy, schmancy.\n5.  Rio Buffet- Our favorite!  Because they are away from the strip, it felt like they had to try a little harder to get people in.  Tons and tons of great food options.\n\nAll buffets have an all-you-can-drink beer and wine option for an extra $10-12 and there is no time limit.  We sat at the Rio buffet for three hours and didn't really eat very much, but drank our fill of wine and no one complained.  \n\nThe only bad part- you do have to totally gorge yourself to make it worth it.  I would say you have to hit at least three buffets and eat pretty well to feel like you got your money's worth.  And you will be full for about 48 hours afterwards... so if getting drunk while in Vegas is in the plan I don't recommend it because you will be far too full for the alcohol to take effect.", 'business_id': 'cRfn_vMQ9YExuKb378CwjQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2013-12-04', 'type': 'review'}

For the most part, you would only have to eat at 2 buffets to earn your money back since most of them are in the $20-$30 range.\n\nHowever, fast forward to now. They made changes to the rules. So the $49 is only for weekday pricing, if you purchase it on the weekend it will charge you $65-$70. The quality of the buffets have also gone down a lot. Costs are always going up, and buffets tend to be the most cost efficient options, so casinos still have to balance out costs and quality. \n\nThe Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars hands down you must try..however, you pay an extra fee to eat here per visit. It's $15 for breakfast, $20 for lunch, and $25 for dinner. It only ends up being a $10-$20 discount from it's normal prices, so that's something to consider.\n\nBesides Baccahanal, my favorite buffets are the Rio and Paris ones.  Harrahs and Flamingo are standard buffets with no standout items, and Planet Hollywood for whatever reason is just a really shitty buffet. And they got rid of the Imperial Palace (aka the Quad) buffet, which didn't matter because that buffet is worst then Hometown Buffet.\n\nThe reason why I rated it down because I wouldn't eat at half of the buffets if they weren't included on the list. Many of the buffets just aren't tasty, and worth eating at.\n\nI don't see much value in the wristband anymore especially if you are staying on the weekend), i rather get in a solid meal at Bacchanal for breakfast/lunch at normal price. And enjoy light meals throughout the day (ie: Earls, Pinks, etc), I'd still come in for less then the price of a wristband and be more satisfied with the food.\n\nHowever, I still think it's a good deal especially if you are a big eater. An extra plus, if you are staying in any of the  Total Rewards hotels that participates in the program since you can get food and drink whenever you like. I stayed at Rio once, and literally would pop in every couple hours for a snack.  \n\nSo it depends on how much you eat and what your daytime activities entail, but one thing is for sure..SIGN UP AND BRING YOUR TOTAL REWARDS CARD...if you don't have one, you don't get the $5 discount!\n\n#GLUTTONY!", 'business_id': 'cRfn_vMQ9YExuKb378CwjQ', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2013-12-21', 'type': 'review'}

This experience was disappointing for one reason: the Total Rewards staff in different properties (and sometimes even within one property) do not have the same information about their businesses and services. So if one person tells you one thing in one place, another person in a different place can tell you directly the opposite. Let me give you an example. When I booked my room for the first time with this package I called to my hotel (Bally\'s) to verify that I\'m getting exactly 2 Buffet of buffet passes during my 3 days stay. The lady on the phone confirmed it. I went to Vegas, and at the Check-in another lady told me that I have only one buffet pass. I said that on the web-site it clearly says that "Stay two nights or more with us and receive two complimentary Buffet of Buffets passes". She confirmed it, and said that I\'m getting two passes but I must use them at once (so I was suppose to be with a friend to use them both). It was disappointing... when I went to one of the buffets, I talked to a lady at the desk, and she said, that I can use both passes at different time and I should just ignore what the other lady at the Check-in said. So during that stay I ended up using both passes for myself and everything was fine. The next time I visited Las Vegas with a friend, and she was staying at the Harrah\'s and I was at Bally\'s again. We both had the 2 complementary passes. In my case at Bally\'s I already knew how to act and they didn\'t charge me anything for using both passes at different time, but in case of my friend at Harrah\'s, they\'d charged her extra $50 for using both two passes. So at her check-out, I had to go to her hotel and talk with their staff to convince them that she could use her passes at different time. After about 30 minutes of arguing and calling the managers, and checking the TR\'s web-site they got convinced that what it says on the web-site is true, and we could use both of our passes. Although each time the situation got resolved in my favor, I still was very disappointed in Total Rewards. I just don\'t get how can their information be so inconsistent . So, buy the pass separately!\n\nThe above information and my disappointment in TR are the reasons I\'m deducting 2 points out of my rating, otherwise I would give the Buffet of Buffets straight 5 stars for being the best Buffet pass in Las Vegas. \n\nNow let me give you some information about the pass itself. \nFirst of all, it\'s totally worth it! Withing that 24 hour period that pass works, you can have 4+ meals at any buffet, which makes each meal worth less than $13.\n\nSo this 24 hour pass gives you access to 7 buffets. Two of theme will charge you some extra money (from $10 to $25) per visit. Those are Bacchanal Buffet at Caesar\'s Palace and the Village Seafood Buffet at Rio.\nThe Bacchanal Buffet is a high-end Buffet, with very good food. It\'s not very large but there are some dishes there, that you won\'t see in other Buffets (eg. lamb chops). It\'s worth a visit. \nThe other buffet that charges you extra is the Village Seafood Buffet at Rio. I walked  trough it, and I can\'t really say that they had anything that seafood sections in other buffets didn\'t have. So probably it doesn\'t worth a visit, unless you\'re really into a seafood.\n\nThe other 5 buffets are totally free if you have the pass.\nThe best food quality you will find at Le Village Buffet at Paris and Spice Market Buffet at Planet Hollywood. They both are about the same size, and have about the same food quality with the Le Village Buffet, probably being little ahead. \nI recommend visiting the Le Village Buffet in the morning, because they have fantastic crepe station there, and the entire atmosphere of that buffet will give you an excellent morning mood. Also in the evening they have complementary wine. So probably these two buffets are going to be your main targets if you have the pass. \n\nThe next best food quality would be probably the Carnival World Buffet at Rio. They have very good service in here and the largest food diversity. As a matter of fact, this is the largest buffet in the World! Too bad it\'s pretty far from the strip.\n\nThen comes the Paradise Garden Buffet at Flamingo. The food quality is a bit lower than in all other buffets, and in general it looks and feels bit cheaper. But when you will get tired from the lines and crowd at Le Village Buffet and Spice Market Buffet, you will come here and relax. \nI never visited the Flavors buffet at Harah\'s, but assuming it\'s the same level or may be even lower than Paradise Garden Buffet. \nTake into consideration that the better is the buffet, the longer are the lines: up to 2 hours, sometimes.', 'business_id': 'cRfn_vMQ9YExuKb378CwjQ', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2014-11-11', 'type': 'review'}

Lots of selections of a variety of cuisines.   Desserts were excellent.  Very fresh crepes!!  Quality of food was good.  Service was excellent.\n\n#3:  (Good)  - Paris Paris for dinner was okay.

I went back twice (sorry not sorry) \n\nI wouldn't get prime rib at rio..theirs was way too salty. \n\n8:00 AM Le Village (Paris) - where do I start..this is breakfast HEAVEN! And their decor is so awesome. Wait was long, about 45 minutes to get in. (NTS-they start at 7 AM). Highlights: \n\n**made to order CREPE station\n**endless variety of egg dishes (fav were the EGGS BENEDICT-so good, and the lox scrambled egg)\n**Lyonnaise potatoes, potato triangles, fingerling potatoes?? So many potatoes..\n**endless variety of sausages as well. \n**sliced ham and slab of bacon, chef is available to cut for you\n**lots of French pastries but some tasted old\n\nI saw them making creme br\xfbl\xe9e but they don't serve it until 11 AM :( we left at 10 AM. Would definitely come back to this one, it was amaazing.\n\n2:00 PM Flavors (Harrah's) - you could definitely forget about this one. We ditched after two plates and left for Rio hahaha\n\nBut I did get raspberry gelato..and it was bomb. \n\nOVERALL-we went to 5 buffets for the price of $55 each person. $11 a buffet. Worth it especially since we couldn't enjoy Vegas to its fullest potential! Buy it during a time where you could make a 4th meal out of it. (Ie 4:00 PM) \n\nAlso-drinks like soda, tea, coffee are included. And all the hotels offer free self parking, if you didn't know :)", 'business_id': 'cRfn_vMQ9YExuKb378CwjQ', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2015-04-02', 'type': 'review'}

When we arrived at Las Vegas last afternoon without lunch, we wanted something that we can eat right away (but not fast food). We ended up purchasing the 24 hour passes. I think this worked out for my family for the following reasons:\n1) we have 2 teenage boys \n2) we love to be able to try a little of everything \n3) we didn't have anything really planned so we could go eat at any time \n\nThis is what we did:\n5:30 pm dinner at Spice Market (PH) - we all loved their prime rib.  My kids liked the chicken wings.  My husband enjoyed a little of everything.  I liked the king crab leg.  The meat at the claw part was sweet.  The rest of the crab meat was ok.  I don't eat crab with butter, so I asked for hot water and made a little salt water to warm up the crab meat and gave it some flavor.  We did not like any of the desserts there.  Everything was too sweet and dense.\n \n7:30 am small breakfast at Le Village - we tried a little of everything and stopped after one plate.  \n\nThen we walked to Flavors, Paradise Garden and Spice Market to check out the selections.  Flavors had fruit/veggie smoothies.  But Le Village still had the best and most extensive breakfast selection.\n\n9:30 am Le Village for breakfast again. This time, the line was outside the restaurant entrance, but they moved fast.   We waited in line for about 20 minutes. \nMy flavor was eggs Benedict.  It was delicious.  The potato triangle were very good.  They had sliced bacon and a slab of bacon.  The one I saw was entire slab of fat, so I wouldn't recommend it.  But I would definitely check it out.  Lots of croissants, muffins, bagels.  They had eggs many different ways (already made) and a omelet station in the middle.   \n\n1 pm Flavors - we were walking around on Las Vegas Blvd in the morning.  By then it was hot.  We went to Flavors to get gelato and drinks.  My kids had some waffle fries that were good.  I was not too impressed by their gelato.  It was overly sweet and did not have the right consistency for gelato.  The strawberry one was good.  Vanilla was too sweet.  Cookies and cream was better than vanilla.  But it was nice to go inside to take a break and have a soda.\n\n\n4 pm dinner at Spice Market.  It was hot and we've done a lot of walking that day. Spice Market was closest to our hotel, so we went there for dinner.  There was no line.  It was the same food we had the night before.  But we were able to enjoy it fully by picking out just the food we liked.", 'business_id': 'cRfn_vMQ9YExuKb378CwjQ', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2015-04-05', 'type': 'review'}

Especially in Vegas where it gets pretty expensive to eat.\n\nWe got the pass on Friday morning before 11am to get the week price, and we also got the discount with the Total Rewards card (get it when you get in Vegas!!). \nYou basically eat one meal for $20 or less, so don't expect some amazing cuisine, even if it was pretty good! Reading other reviews some people always expect $100 dinners when they pay only $20...\n\n- Friday breakfast : We went to the Harrah's. It was simple but pretty good, we had an American breakfast with pancakes, bacon, fruits, et little desserts. We decided to go there in the morning since we knew they didn't have a lot of choice, but it was plenty for breakfast!\n\n- Friday lunch: Spice Market at the Planet Hollywood. Mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes and meat loaf were amazing! They have a lot of choices and pretty good desserts, we were pretty full after that lunch!!\n\n- Friday afternoon: We went back around 5pm to the Harrah's to get some delicious ice creams!\n\n- Friday night: The Paris buffet, Le village, one of my favorite buffet on the strip! Cr\xe8pes are so good!! They have a lot of choice, and a lot of desserts!\n\n- Saturday morning... we were back at the Paris for some more cr\xe8pes!!\n\nThe wait at any of the buffet was like 10minutes maximum, we probably went later than anybody else. It seems like 9.30-9.45am, 2pm and 8.30pm are good time to go!\nVery good deal! I recommend it to anybody!!", 'business_id': 'cRfn_vMQ9YExuKb378CwjQ', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2015-05-12', 'type': 'review'}

We bought our pass on a Sunday night around 9pm at the RIO. Since we were Total Rewards members, we paid $55 each. Beware: you pay upfront for the pass and they will ask you to TIP on the total. I think it's best to write: CASH, and just tip your server personally at each buffet.\n\n1st stop @9pm, Rio Carnival buffet. Waited about 20 minutes in line. HUGE dining room, tons of options! I liked the fried and steamed shrimp as well as the gelato! The crab legs and prime rib were really popular. And the Asian noodle/soup bar was really cool! The Mexican food and pasta was not touched by anyone.....\n\n2nd stop: 9am Harrah's breakfast buffet. Got seated right away! Typical breakfast options: eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, waffles, fruit, salad bar, pastries. They did have a free mimosa/bloody mary bar as well as an omelet and crepe station. I didn't try an omelet, but opted for a crepe. The line wasn't too long, but it wasn't worth the wait. The crepe itself was good, but the filling was just plain cherry pie filling from can-- gross! I did like their assortment of pastries and soft-serve ice cream (around the corner, so don't miss it). They also had a lot of sugar-free dessert options! I really liked the seating next to the live flamingos!\n\n3rd stop: 2pm lunch at Planet Hollywood. There was no wait, so we got seated right away! I thought that this was the cleanest, newest, and nicest dining area. I loved the desserts (cr\xe8me brulee, cotton candy, soft-serve ice cream, etc); some of them were fancy and not just the typical pre-made, store bought desserts. The prime rib and pre-made salads were delish! I loved the Caesar salad! The sliders (both chicken and beef) were disgusting! \n\n4th stop: 8pm dinner at Le Village at The Paris. We waited in line about 30 minutes. Everyone raves about this buffet, but it was my least favorite! I'm not sure if it was because this was our last buffet and we were sort of buffet-ed out, or because it was a Monday night. The French onion soup was the saving grace! Although I was bummed to have to search for the croutons and cheese to add to it-- should have been right next to the soup! Again, crab legs were popular with other tables, as were the crepes. We waited in line for dinner crepes-- I had a chicken, cheese, and spinach, and my husband had the mushroom. BOTH were TERRIBLE! All of the fillings were cold, and they were not cooked long enough to have the cheese melt. We were both really disappointed. The desserts were also very disappointing-- nothing was good! \n\nThis pass was worth the price since we squeezed 4 buffets in, but next time we are in Vegas, I plan on trying the Spice Buffet, Bellagio, or Wynn, and skipping the pass! I only need one buffet in my life!", 'business_id': 'cRfn_vMQ9YExuKb378CwjQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2015-06-05', 'type': 'review'}
