It's on Las Vegas Boulevard, about 4 or 5 miles south of Mandalay Bay, in the same mega-shopping complex as a woefully outdated outlet mall.\n\nThe reason to come to BWW is (of course) the chicken wings.  I almost always get the boneless teriyaki, but you can get traditional wings too in more than a dozen different types of sauces, ranging from mild to dangerous.  BWW is more than just wings.  It has an unbelievable menu.  You can get a typical burger, pulled pork or grilled chicken sandwich.  There's also an awesome selection of appetizers.  Cheeseburger dippers, mini quesadillas, and my personal favorite mini corn dogs (with honey bbq sauce) are just some of the highlights.  Maybe my only gripe is that BWW does not serve traditional fries.  The only option are these things called Buffalo Chips, which are round fries about the size of nickels.  And of course, there's a good selection of beer.\n\nBWW is the ultimate place to get together with friends, watch the game and gorge yourself on food.  This location in particular has tv's everywhere, ranging from massive to small, many of them high-def.  To top it off it has the trivia game to pass the time between games and waiting for your food.  The restaurant is split up, with the main dining area in front.  A huge wall separates it from the bar area in the back, where people can smoke.  I can't recommend BWW strong enough to have a good time.  The location near the Galleria Mall in Henderson is also very fun.", 'business_id': 'efsZLHcgEn7hKGB05B569Q', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2007-12-29', 'type': 'review'}

I place B-Wild in competition with places like TGI Fridays, Chili's and BJ's.  In particular, as a fan of Chili's, I felt like this place should wow me beyond any particular experience at Chili's.  Chili's is decent, but it is a heartless chain... B-Wild is supposed to be the happy, super cool bar and grill that is a chain but gives the Mom and Pop type experience.\n\nFirst issue was the seating.  I felt as if there were not enough boothes and too many standalone tables.  Perhaps it was a layout issue or even a fire issue, but I think a bar and grill should just have a ton of boothes.  It is more comfortable for beer and wings.\n\nSecondly, the food was just not really up to snuff.  The fries sort of soggie and a little bit cold.  It is a real problem when you are serving shoe-string fries.  The wing sauces were fine (spicy garlic and Asian... actually the Asian one was really good), but I thought the the wings were a little on the tiny side.  Plus, $12.49 for 18 would be okay if the wings were a little bit bigger.  It just did not look impressive sitting in a couple of fry trays either.  The burger meat was okay, but I didn't have the option to have the meat medium and it was a little burnt.  I know I ordered cajun style, but come on!  The buns were good, but were cold.\n\nFinally, the service needed a little work.  The food took a long while to come out (might explain the cold fries).  Then some things were forgotten like the side of blue cheese for the wings and my salad.  Finally, I know that it was kind of slow, but servers were standing around talking to eachother rather than watching the tables.\n\nMaybe it was just an off day... maybe it is better on a game day... maybe I should have had a pitcher of beer...!\n\nI suppose that one should not be so picky about a bar and grill, but I really like the concept and appreciate the corporate management of the company.  So, I hope that they can make some improvements if the issue is systematic.  If it is just this one place, then I hope the manager regulates this location better.", 'business_id': 'efsZLHcgEn7hKGB05B569Q', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2008-12-02', 'type': 'review'}

It was pretty cool...we booked a date and time several weeks in advance and when we arrived they had a nice private table set up for us. We also got a great draft kit that included a board (we were able to hang it up on the wall) and color coded player stickers that were bright and visible for all at the table to see. We also got gift certificates for future visits and a discount on the bill. We had such a good experience that there was no question that we would be back for our draft in \'09.\n\nSo, this year I called three weeks prior to make our reservation. The guy manager that I spoke to was pleasant and helpful on the phone. I even had to call a couple of days later to change to date (same guy, very accommodating). On the day of our draft, very different story. I showed up early and noticed that a table was not set up for us. I inquired at the bar and the bartender just pointed to a high-top for us to sit at. This would not do, especially since we need a quieter area for the 12 of us to hear each other and wall space to hang our board. I started to wander over to the table we had last year and as a server walked by I asked for the manager. I waited, and waited, and still no manager, so my friends and I pushed tables together ourselves and sat down. Finally the manager arrived..she was very unwelcoming and told us we had to sit in the bar because she only had one bartender on and no server that could serve us. I explained to her that we wanted to sit here, that we had been here last year (same time at night) and it was an ideal setup, and that one of our players wasn\'t even 21 and able to sit in the bar. She was very rude and gave in to us sitting there eventually, but not without threatening us with the police!! Oh, yeah, we are in the dining/restaurant part of the place because like I said one of our guys is 20, and she\'s telling us that there is a curfew on the strip (mind you, we are no where near the resort corridor) and if the police come in, its not her problem. Then she went on to say that all the servers were leaving...we said "fine" and that we would just walk to the bar to order food and drinks. In the end we spent a lot less money because it was difficult to keep getting up in the middle of all our action to get more beer and food. No discount either. One other thing, another fantasy football team was there that same night and didn\'t seem to like being told they had to sit in the loud bar area either...they eventually moved all of their stuff in the dining/restaurant part too.\n\nSo...I am also in another fantasy league. For the last four years, this league has always done its draft at Hard Rock Cafe. This year, based on my experience from \'08 I convinced them to have the draft and BWW. After the experience with my first draft of \'09 I called the day before to reconfirm the reservation and to make sure that the table we wanted would be available. Of course, the manage (the guy) didn\'t have our reservation. What!! We made it three weeks prior!! good thing I called. Again, I got there early (eager to make sure everything was going to go well especially after I got everyone to break from our HR Cafe tradition). We did get the table we wanted and we were even going to get service this time! woo hoo! Lots more drinking and food this time! Just as everyone shows up the manager (a manager, not the lady from the previous draft) informed us that they had no more draft kits! Really!! Are you kidding me!! We booked three weeks ago and I had even confirmed with the day manager who said nothing about not having any draft kits!!! I was so embarrassed and pissed off. I really thought my team was going to have a good experience and want to come back year after year. I guess we are just going to have to go back to HR Cafe or I hear Hooters has draft parties?? BOO WILD WINGS!!!\n\nP.S. I spent the first 25 years of my life in Buffalo....your wings are NOT real buffalo wings!!!\n\nP.P.S One star for the potato wedges with cheese and the really nice, attentive server we had the second draft of \'09.', 'business_id': 'efsZLHcgEn7hKGB05B569Q', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2009-09-03', 'type': 'review'}

So this was my first time at Buffalo Wild Wings. I have seen the commercials about the customers not wanting to leaving and talking to the referee about extending the game. I did not think it was that great that i wanted to stay longer there. I know it's a commercial, but i would call it false advertising. lol. \n\nSo it was a Tuesday and apparently they have cheap wings on this day. You can go with one sauce or with multiple. The minimum per sauce was 3 so i got 5 Hot BBQ, 5 mild, and 5 Honey BBQ. I didn't want to fill myself up too much because there are so many places to eat in Vegas. My friend got the hot mango one and it was pretty spicy and left the lips burning a little bit. But it had good flavor so it was worth the burn the second time. \n\nThe service was alright...except she forgot 5 of my friend's wings. lol. I guess our order was too confusing or something. It took a while though to get my change from the bill.... but they were a little busy so it was understandable. I do not like to hate on restaurants.

I think even Hooters\' 3 Mile Island is hotter.\n\nThat being said, I also love the Caribbean Jerk sauce even though it\'s barely hot at all - it\'s not supposed to be.

The guest of honor and his girlfriend (the planner) were running late, and the wife and I ended up being the first people from our group. We were told to ask for our party\'s table, the hostess said they don\'t take names/reservations, and she didn\'t know anything about it. Turns out, the General Manager either doesn\'t know how to inform her employees of group reservations, or her employees just don\'t know how to do their jobs. After the rest of our experience, I am leaning toward incompetent employees.\n\nOnce the planner called and talked to the hostess and explained everything to her, suddenly a group table was set up. We were seated and had our drink order taken relatively quickly. That first round of drinks turned out to be the ONLY one I got. If you aren\'t drinking alcohol, the waitstaff does not care to check up on you. And, one of their families or close friends was a table over from us, you can guess where the service went.\n\nI have been privy to many large group activities with menu based ordering. Intelligent staff will either section off the order or at least make notes as to where the food goes. Not sure if our order taker did that, as the staff that brought out the food would stand, literally, next to tables about 5 feet away from us and use a normal speaking voice asking us who\'s food was in her hands. \n\nIf you have never been to a BWW before, they are big rooms with maybe a dozen or more TV sets playing sports. Add to that, a couple large parties in the room (one of which was having a great time laughing constantly), the room gets a bit loud. It is OK in that situation to speak up, or get closer to the table to ask where the food goes. Enunciation and speaking up are important too. Many of us could only discern partial words coming out of the server\'s mouth when asking about the food in her hands.\n\nThe food was OK, nothing spectacular, for us at least. The couple across from us ordered some wings (were brought the wrong type boneless vs bone-in) and one batch had such a horrific flavor she could not stand the first bite. The servers never came by to ask if the food was ok, and this girl was too polite to yell at someone to get their attention.\n\nOur food order included some sides to dip our food in, which were never received, but still on our check. We, of course, had those taken off. The $5.00 "service charge" for our large group is a bit of a crock. Had we gotten service, the staff would have been given nice tips. Being that we were forced to pay that much, that was about $4.95 more than they deserved.\n\nIf you want a sports fan friendly place to drink over priced alcohol and eat overpriced food, BWW is a decent enough place to get raucous with your friends.\n\nHowever, if you would like to get what you order, have your drinks refilled AT ALL and enjoy your visit, you may want to go elsewhere.', 'business_id': 'efsZLHcgEn7hKGB05B569Q', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2011-08-02', 'type': 'review'}

The combo comes with your choice of sauce, coleslaw, and french fries. The fries are mediocre, kind of on the soggy side and the coleslaw is sub par.

They'll charge you an arm and a leg for them too. At BWW you can add any wing sauce or wing rub to your burger. Maybe the burger isn't top-notch quality, BUT you are getting a very interesting burger combo for a much cheaper price than at a burger joint that will upcharge you for EVERYTHING.\n\nI got my burger cooked with the chipotle rub and it was delicious. I also asked for a small container of the chipotle rub to sprinkle on my french fries - so good too. You also get a selection of cheeses at BWW and I tend to go with the pepperjack cheese for an extra kick. \n\nSo, it does pay to take a look at the menu at a place even if they are well known for a certain type of food.

Guess it's to be expected on game day-I'm not a big sports person, but I do enjoy watching people get riled up and yell and scream when sh*t hits the fan on the million flat screens they have on the walls. \n\nI ordered the 48 or 50 piece wings for $34.95 with 4 different types of sauces and my friend had a standard burger.  Place was cracking and only took about 20. I chose the Teriyaki, Lemon Pepper, Thai Curry and my favorite Mango Habenero'. \n\nAll the chicken had the bones (I prefer it that way) and all probably cooked slightly longer than needed to be-but not a huge deal. The Lemon Pepper ones were under Seasoned, The Thai Curry hinted at that peanut type flavor, and the Teriyaki was just slathered in the sauce....The Mango Habenero were just right and I devoured them. It was a lot more food than I expected-I ate about 30 pieces before I had to undo a belt notch. lol \n\nThe beers were nice and ice cold and they have a decent selection, though I think our total time there was about 2 and a half hours, but the service in between items could've probably been sped up a little bit.\n\nAll in all, not the best, not the worst, but a great place to b.s. with a friend and catch up with the standard Sports Bar feel. I'll probably come back on one of the wing specialty nights with some friends. Like I said, some of the server girls were smokin hot with those black football lines under their eyes. \n\nHope you like my review! Cheers!\n\n~Mb", 'business_id': 'efsZLHcgEn7hKGB05B569Q', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2012-12-04', 'type': 'review'}

I've tried other flavors but I don't think any really compare to that. I'm not really a big spicy person either. Plenty of big screens to watch sports on but I don't really come here for sports. It can get really busy when a big game is on or any game for that matter. \n\nThe service is pretty much a hit or miss here.

Fool me twice, shame on me. Fool me a 3rd time and...quit fooling me damn it!\n\nI always enjoy my Spicy Garlic Wings. After my December visit I made the mistake of returning to this location in January. When my wings arrived they were clearly old (not fresh) and looked terrible sitting on the server\'s tray next to someone else\'s hot fresh wings. I pointed this out to the server and she replied the wings are "always fresh" which proved two things. 1st, she doesn\'t understand how the kitchen at BWW functions, and 2. She\'s blind. I asked her if it was her order would she accept it...her response was she doesn\'t like Chicken.\n\nI then asked for a manager who proceeded to tell me the wings looked fine but she\'ll bring new ones...they look fine, really? I\'ll pass....and we left. Strike Two.\n\nAfter two strikes I suppose I\'m a glutton for punishment. I returned in Feb. for a third visit and I thought for sure the third time was a charm. The bartender was friendly and my wings arrived quickly. The wings themselves were a bit dry but I\'ve lowered my standards and I was hungry! My second bite into the second wing I found a hair in my mouth. It wasn\'t my hair...DAMN! COMPLETELY DISGUSTING.\n\nThe bartender was very apologetic and took the food away quickly. She then informed the manager of the situation. This was a very heavy hispanic gentleman who came around the bar, leaned over next to me and said, "so what happened?"  You\'re kidding right...what happened? Didn\'t the bartender just tell you? Where\'s my apology? Where\'s your concern? What happened? REALLY?\n\nOn my way out I wrote down the name of the General Manager on the door and proceeded to call the listed number which of course was simply the direct line to the restaurant. The person who answered the phone didn\'t recognize the name I was asking for (HER BOSS) and after placing me on hold to check with someone else came back to advise me the GM is not there, comes and goes without warning and there is no way to contact her unless I leave a message. I chose to leave the message here instead.

Well me and 2 friends went here for lunch today and we waited nearly 50 minutes to get our food.  That's a crazy long time.  Turns out they had a problem with their system and because of the issues, our order probably got lost.  We assume that's what happened when the bartender serving us asked what sauces we wanted again about 30 minutes in to our wait.  Well the food was good once we got it and a manager came over and talked to us to explain the system issues.  She said she would discount the check for us.  Turns out she discounted the whole thing, so despite waiting for a long time the food and drinks ended up being free.  Can't beat free!!!  So I gave this 4 stars because I respect places that recognize when they screwed up and are willing to give us a free meal in order to maintain our business for the future.  So many places want to just shut you up and not really do much for you, but 3 guys eating meals for free because you messed up is a good example of what they should be doing to keep customers happy.

The front part of the restaurant is a dinning room for families.  The back part is a huge bar, decorated with lots of big screen TVs for game watching.  Along side the bar are bar top tables, which we decided to sit at.  Our server was also the bartender and pleasant to work with.   I slipped him my card at the beginning so I could pay for the meal and he caught the hint, took the card from under the table and did a great job keeping it a secret from my bestie.  \n\nFor our meal, we started with the Mozzarella sticks for $6.49 and mini corn dogs for $5.79.  The mozzarella sticks crispy and perfectly breaded on the outside, and gooey mozzarella goodness on the inside.  The marinara dipping sauce made the stick taste like a good cheese pizza!  The corn dogs were literally bite sized hush puppy goodness.  The corn bread batter wasn't overpowering the dog.  There was a dipping sauce for this as well, mustard I think.  It made the corn dogs delicious!  I also decided to get the small boneless wings containing 10 boneless wings.  Parmesan Garlic was my flavor choice.  I liked the wing.  It was battered and super crunchy.  The Parmesan Garlic, on the other hand, was not as good as the actual wing.  It was too tangy and super salty.

I was not a fan, to be honest.  \n\nFootball season is coming up, so you know I'll be at BWW at least couple more times during the season.

This used to be my go-to hangout...but I will never go back!!!! :( Last Sunday I went in during the first quarter of the Bears game. I sat at the bar and it took nearly 15 minutes for a bartender to acknowledge me, even tho they were only about 1/2 full. I am a pretty big gamer, and needed my players card. Ten minutes after the girl bartender (never got either of the bartenders names, they barely acknowledged me let alone introduce themselves,) took my ID I asked what the hold up was, she told me she could not find my card and had to print a new one. This is now 25 minutes into sitting here, nothing in front of me and not gaming either. I finally got my card and started to play. Guy bartender brought me the bottle of water I asked him for and took my order. It was the end of the halftime, beginning of THIRD quarter before I got my food. By now I had gambled quite a bit, I had the empty bottle of water on the ledge and no one replaced it. I had to flag down a bartender to get another. When I was done, I went to front and asked for a manager. When AGM came up I explained how ignored I had been. She never even asked for my name, and didn't seem to care that I had lost a great deal of money (which was not her problem, but a gamer should be treated with the utmost respect) and had terrible service. She gave me the GM's card and walked away. I called the next day and left a message with whomever answered phone. I never got a call back.  I will never go back, and at one point in the last year or two, I was one of this establishments biggest gamers and better customers. *shakes my head in disgust.*", 'business_id': 'efsZLHcgEn7hKGB05B569Q', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2013-12-28', 'type': 'review'}

He told me that they cook the chicken fresh and chill it down every morning  and that most people complain having a hot fresh grill chicken on their salad. I don't know about you Mr. but the chicken looked like that resealable Tyson grilled chicken cubed and tasted like it was stuck behind the pantry freezer.

One person went in just before 5:30 to get an update and witnessed the Manager giving a "pep talk" which was more like a chewing out of employees. The mgr did in no way seem to be professional and seemed to not care that there was line of people outside all waiting to see an event that had already started. When people finally started going in at approximately 5:30 the Mgr at one point stopped and said "in the last 10 minutes I have let in approximately 25 people, we have to stop or we\'re going to kill our kitchen" She at no point explained to the people waiting what the hold up was, or even apologize for the delay. The food was ok, nothing to brag about. The chips & salsa were bland, definitely wouldn\'t order that again. We were seated at a corner table, and as the building became full and obviously no one else could fit, they let all the remaining people stand in the lobby. From our view a few of the standing people were blocking views of the tv\'s.

Their wings have great flavored options that are super tasty and the meat on the wings aren\'t skimpy, always full meat wings. \n\nPlace is clean and spacious, and service has always been good. Besides the wings, they also have really good appetizers and I\'ve had their burgers more than once, and the Black and Bleu burger is really good if you\'re a bleu cheese fan. \n\nFav hot flavor is def the Mango Habenero, some people say it\'s too hot but I say if you like "asian style spicy" go for it!! I\'m never disappointed when eating here. \n\nI like how they have lots of wet napkins at the table already so you never have to ask the server for it. \n\nLike I said, this is my go to place especially with FOOTBALL season and the super big screens just making watching more fun cheering for your teams with friends and family!', 'business_id': 'efsZLHcgEn7hKGB05B569Q', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2014-09-08', 'type': 'review'}

The burgers and sandwiches are pretty meh and overpriced for what you get. Fortunately the wings are delicious and there is a good selection of sauces and dry rubs to go along with them. \n\nI guess this is the place to watch sports but I always feel that the image from the  projectors is washed out and you can never quite hear whats going on. $6-7 for a beer is more than what I would want to pay for a place like Bdubs. This location in particular gets a lot of traffic especially from tourists as its just a mile south of the Strip.

We had drinks which were good, we ordered Mozzerella sticks which were also good, and then the traditional wings came.. they were SO dry and barely any sauce on them.

We came here for lunch and wanted something quick before hitting the road to visit some of the areas outside Vegas.\n\nIt took our server 3 trys to get our drink order correct (an orange juice and lemonade, nothing too complicated). They brought the wrong appetizer to the table, took that away then took another 20-minutes to get the right one to us. Then brought the wrong entrees, and again took another 20-minutes after those were taken away before getting our food. Never got our drinks refilled during the whole time we were there.\n\nOverall the whole staffed behaved like it was their first day. Running around like chickens with their heads cut off, going from table to table with an order of food until they hit the right one. It is obvious there is a lack of leadership and guidance from the management of this location. This is an example of not training the staff and letting their shifts just be a good time for them and requiring little to no discipline from a lazy manager. Either that or the management here has absolutely no idea how to run a restaurant.\n\nI highly recommend avoiding this location. They are lucky to be on the main road into the strip, so they can survive with little to no repeat business, because i cannot imagine anyone coming here would come again.', 'business_id': 'efsZLHcgEn7hKGB05B569Q', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2015-08-12', 'type': 'review'}
