I pretty much just order delivery. The food at this place is soooo fucking good. I think if I actually went there, it might spoil the magic a little bit. I prefer to imagine it as some really clean and yet authentic italian bistro. \n\nPizza is excellent, hot subs are amazing, pasta dishes are to die for, and salads are perfect. The prices are great too. If they will deliver to you, you might as well call Jerry Springer and schedule a time a few years from now when he can film you being forklifted from your house.\n\nEdit 4/21/08 - I finally visited the location... it's in that gungy strip mall on 40th and Indian School. I had imagined it being a gorgeous italian cafe in the middle of a lush green field with butterflies floating around and a bunch of stereotype chubby italian chefs with large moustaches bustling around tossing pizza dough in the air. \n\nThe truth is, it's just a tiny spot in an old strip alongside a crappy gym and a grocery store. They have nice little cafe tables and chairs outside on the sidewalk and a few tables inside, so it would be great for lunch - however, I wouldn't suggest it for a romantic dinner. I'm sticking with delivery or pickup. \n\nStill 5 stars, still love it.\n\nHere's a tip: If you wrap the leftover pizza in foil and fridge it, when you want to eat it again - it's great cold, but if you start up the oven to pre-heat at about 350, you can stick the pizza on the foil in the oven and it'll be ready by the time it's done pre-heating... that should be in just a few minutes.

You know, the kind that comes in a frozen block at the grocery store that you're supposed to wring out before you use it.\n2)The crust was beyond soggy...it was downright WET. Probably from the aforementioned icky spinach.\n3)The wings come with a packet of blue cheese salad dressing, the kind you pick out of a basket at cafeteria salad bars.

At least it matched the pizza...\n\nThere are too many decent pizza places to risk this place again.", 'business_id': 'k8JnZBspVOI8kLcQek-Chw', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2008-10-25', 'type': 'review'}

The delicious salad (ham, salami, cheese rolled up and sliced, pepperoni, lettuce, artichokes, roasted red peppers, black olives, pepperoncinis, and tomatoes) came w/ soft bread that made me place an order for garlic bread w/ the pasta dishes since soft bread just wasn\'t cutting it for us.  The salad would\'ve satisfied the both of us, but we attempted to take it easy since there were two pasta dishes coming up!  (We ended up boxing up half the salad for leftovers.)\n\nVeal parmigiana was my companion\'s immediate decision, but since she rarely enjoys the dishes she picks, I knew I had to have a back-up, and w/ so many selections to choose from, the decision was very hard to make.  So I decided I\'d go w/ the tried and true meatball ziti.  Was I pleased w/ both entrees!!  Sure enough, my companion did not enjoy the veal parmigiana (how fortunate for me!!), and she told me to be sure to put it into my review that it wasn\'t any good.  I told her she should start a yelp profile so that she could make that assertion herself!  I, on the other hand, enjoyed feasting on both dishes.  The garlic bread was perfectly seasoned and wonderfully crispy!  Their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter... Mmmm...!  (And yes, she loved the ziti w/ meatballs... Now I\'m regretting not ordering a side of meatballs to go!  Oh well, guess I\'ll have to make another trip to MM soon.)\n\nEven though I was thoroughly satisfied w/ salad, bread, and the pastas, we did end up sharing a cannoli.  She didn\'t like it at all, saying it was flavorless and was left yearning for a cannoli from Whole Foods (Ray/101).  I, on the other hand, thought it very good: the shell was crunchy and wasn\'t greasy-tasting at all, and the chocolate-chip studded filling wasn\'t overly-sweet.  (And no, I do not like WF\'s cannolis... too sweet and too vinegar-y, if that makes any sense at all.)\n\nThe venue\'s signage didn\'t impress my companion and immediately implanted the idea in her mind that this place was a "dive," but I was very impressed w/ how busy the place was, and how great-tasting the food served was.  I\'m sure my companion would\'ve come away w/ a more positive experience had there been a separate dining area w/ table service (and therefore not have to dodge heavy foot-traffic while we dined).  Now that I\'ve visited this place, I\'ll be able to give future companions a description of what to expect when dining here: a no-frills walk-up counter best visited during non-rush hours serving awesome antipasto salad and great pastas!  \n\nMamma Mia!

There is no fault to be found with their two slices special. My favorite trio of toppings is meatball, onion, and basil. This brings you to about $5.00. The pizza slices are very large and crunch when you bite into them.\n\nThis review centers around the two slices deal.\n\nSituation:\nI work at 44th St. and Thomas and am always looking for great food on the cheap.\n\nGetting there:\nIf you\'re coming from the east on Indian School, turn left at 40th St as opposed to turning into the parking lot closer to Bally\'s. If you\'re coming southeast from Indian School, take 40th St. and turn left when you see the drive through liquor joint.\n\nParking:\nIt\'s a tight parking lot. If you\'re in a larger vehicle it would be best to park a little nearer to the check cashing place.\n\nMenu:\nIf you\'re going for the two slices deal, pick up one of the paper menus as some of the available toppings aren\'t featured on the big menu above the counter.\n\nOrdering:\nThe only thing to note about ordering is that they will not let you order the two slices deal in advance. This probably doesn\'t concern 98% of the population but is a bummer when you\'re meeting up with someone with limited time or want something on the run. The pizza will take between 5 - 10 minutes. They give you a small cup. China mist iced tea was added within the last six months which was nice since I try to avoid soda whenever I\'m already wrecking shop on my health with the pizza.\n\nService:\nYour order will be brought to you whether you sit inside or out. The inside is a lot more comfortable since the table that cramped the interior was removed. There are misters outside.\n\nThe food:\nThe pizza is a real treat. The slices are slightly smaller than Sbarro (just a point of reference, put the flamethrowers away) but the pizza is completely different. Where a slice of NY style pizza can be folded and needs support from a second hand, Mamma Mia\'s remains stiff with its thin crust. Is this New Jersey style pizza? I have no idea.\n\nI haven\'t had a bad set of slices here. The quality is consistent though I have had some jalapenos that weren\'t all the way baked leaving them way to spicy for me and my ham and pineapple mix.\n\nThe only other item I\'ve had here is the stuffed meat supreme which, from the website, is "pizza crust on top and bottom stuffed with pepperoni, sausage, ham, ricotta, mozzarella and sauce." If you\'ve been minding some tofu diet for a month and deserve a caloric overdose; or are trying to commit suicide in a delicious way, it\'s a great choice.\n\nGrated Parmesan, crushed red peppers, garlic powder, and oregano are available in shakers. \n\nConclusion:\nFor being dough, sauce, and cheese, Mamma Mia really do something amazing here. This is a restaurant that I\'m excited to take anyone to who hasn\'t yet been. If you haven\'t been... what are you waiting for?

But it\'s the pizza that\'s the big star here and I don\'t know if it\'s just me but it seems like there\'s been a slow but noticeable decline in its quality. Less toppings, burnt crust more often than not, cheese that seems to congeal in the five minutes it takes to go from box to mouth. They used to have a lot more hot sandwich and a drink specials too. Chicken parm, cordon bleu, meatball subs, all delicious! Just not offered with as much regularity or in as plentiful a portion as they used to be. \n\nPlus, and this might be a personal beef, but the drink that came with the two slices special has been scaled back to a much smaller cup. Have the extra couple gulps of soda per transaction really translated to that much of an increase in syrup costs? Is an extra six ounces of drink really hurting business?\n\nOne last point and I\'ll end this sigh-inducing session. The service at Mamma Mia\'s is really pretty crappy now. Granted it was never the friendliest pizza joint (I seriously don\'t get the love expressed in all these reviews, as I\'ve never seen it), but I\'m just as happy with a terse and professional transaction as I am a chatty one. Now I\'m lucky to get so much as acknowledgment upon approaching the counter. Usually just a blank stare from the cashier as they wait for you to speak up, followed by the price of whatever you wanted. No "Thanks." No "It\'ll be just a minute." Nada.

When a person takes the time to write a 4 paragraph comment, and ends the last paragraph with, "Don\'t get me wrong, I\'m still going to stop by for a quick couple of slices now and then", you really have to sit back and scratch your head.  I guess some people are just poised for negativity.  When all you can do is make a valiant attempt to point out all the short comings that you think you have found, and then make the comment, "I seriously don\'t get the love expressed in all these reviews, as I\'ve never seen it", you must truly be a hater.  I love the wings at Mama Mia\'s; I have never got a soggy order of wings, they are always crispy and flavorful.  Sure they may have down sized the cup, but if you were a true groupie, you would remember that at one time there was only one size of cup, period.  Now, one has been down sized, but there is a choice of two cups, a large and a small.  Who cares if they down sized the cup, the drinks have free refills any way.  Oh, so you have to make a few more trips to the soda fountain to get more soda, big deal.  If you are getting it to go, drop a few more cents and get a large, it isn\'t that much more to spring for.  \n\nThe counter girls I think are great.  They are always sweet & kind and are very willing to help me with prompt and courteous service.  Yes, maybe at times it gets really busy and they can\'t give me their full attention, but that is business in a very popular and very busy pizzeria.  Very seldom do I go to Mama Mia\'s, and there isn\'t a wait or a line ahead of me.  I have been going to Mama Mia\'s since they opened in November of 2004.  I have always loved their pizzas, wings, and subs.  They have a slew of subs to choose from as well as many pasta dishes and calzones, all made fresh to order.  Yes some of the subs change as far as the specials are concerned.  Some come and some go to make room for new ones.  Then old subs come back and then they are gone again.  My favorite sub ever was Jays Caribbean Chicken Sub.  It was a short special, but I still loved it and if it comes back I will get it again.  It is what it is.\n\nMama Mia\'s is a great pizza restaurant that has been a neighborhood icon since 2004.  Even in the worst of economic times they never changed their prices and have stayed true to the game all the way.  You can still get 2 slices of pizza and a soda for $3.50, and you can\'t beat that anywhere.  So thank you Mama Mia\'s for being there to fulfill my pizza needs and desires whenever I get the urge.

And I\'d prefer 1.5 stars. \n\nNevertheless, I must first tell you that their pizza is delicious.  And they have a low-carb pizza (under 10 carbs for a 12 inch pizza? awesome!).  DELICIOUS!  Seriously good pizza.   \n\nWhy then only 2 stars?  Seriously terrible service.  Unfortunately, my love of their pizza is actually negated by the terrible, terrible lack of quality service.   And here\'s a little tidbit to set your expectations - the customer is NEVER right here.  Let me count the ways that frustrate me endlessly here.   1) Time - it took 1 hour and 45 minutes (and 2 phone calls in which I was "assured" it was already en route) to get pizza delivered last time.  The time before, it was 55 minutes. It\'s never been less than an hour and  I live less than 4 blocks from here. *sigh*  2) Prices and Billing - every time we have ordered from them, our bill has been messed up.  We\'ve been overcharged on multiple occasions.  Also their prices on Yelp are totally incorrect, so be sure to check their website AND confirm prices with them directly before you place an order ($1.99 cannoli listed online is actually $3.99 or 4.99!?)  3) Fees, fees, fees!   They charge extra fees for using a credit and some additional taxes?  I don\'t even understand, but my receipt had about 3 or 4 extra "fees" billed.  WEIRD.  4) Messing up orders -  they have NEVER gotten my order correct in the half a dozen times I\'ve ordered from them.  NEVER.  and when I ask or call about it, they tell me that I ordered wrong  (both over the phone and online).  Last time I ordered from here (11/13), one of the women who worked here made me read the email confirmation to her and argued with me that I ordered wrong.  I ordered a sausage & pepperoni pizza with tomatoes & peppers.  I got a pizza with half pepperoni, no sausage, and half had tomatoes & peppers.  Not quite there Mamma Mia. But they did charge me for the additional toppings, even though they didn\'t get it right!  As the staff member was telling me I didn\'t know how to use a computer or order properly, I pointed out that there was in fact, no sausage on my pizza at all, and that the order indeed said sausage, she still didn\'t apologize or just admit it was wrong! UGH!!  After waiting 1 hr and 45 min for the wrong order, I was ticked off. Not cool!  At least apologize for the wait and getting it wrong, a small discount off a future order would have been appropriate in this circumstance too.  5) Terrible customer service in general.  The woman I spoke with a few times always sounds annoyed when you call to place an order, and don\'t even think about asking a question b/c good luck with that.  After errors in billing, long delays in delivery, misinformation about delivery time (they said 30 min, it has never been under an hour), and messing up the actual orders they will never just apologize or say they got wrong.  Unbelievable!     \n\nThe worst part - this could be 1) my favorite pizza place, especially since it\'s just around the corner from my house  and 2) probably one of the top pizza places in the entire Valley.... but just have ZERO expectations when it comes to service.   \n\nTo successfully order from Mamma Mia\'s, here\'s what my boyfriend and I have decided (seriously, we do still like their pizza):   \n-order pizza at least 1.5 - 2 hours before you want it \n-order online and then call to review the confirmation by phone immediately after (also print and bring your confirmation with you)\n-order for pick-up only (NO DELIVERY!)\n-pay only in cash, never credit card --- and only pay after carefully reviewing your receipt \n-double-check your order while you are in the store to ensure it is correct \n\nIf you follow Steps 1 - 5 correctly, then you will be rewarded the delicious, delicious prize of a wonderful PIZZA!!  and after all that work, you earned it!', 'business_id': 'k8JnZBspVOI8kLcQek-Chw', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2013-12-11', 'type': 'review'}

The place is super small inside (I can't remember if any tables are actually inside) and you walk up and order your pizza at the counter.

The crust is exactly the way I like it, and the pizza had "good bones", but I found the cheese to be slightly curdled.  That doesn\'t mean spoiled by any means, but it should be smoother and more creamy.  That, plus the fact that the online order would have charged me 3 extra dollars on order made it not 5-stars.

So I called again the following week (don't recall which day). The person who answered the phone said that the owner was suppose to have credited everyone and I should have received the credit. I hadn't. She also said there was a gas leak. That's a lie as the entire building and area would have been shut down. After some back and forth, I finally got the credit.\n\nNow tonight.
