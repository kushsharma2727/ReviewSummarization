To have the word Chicago anywhere near this menu is downright criminal.  Aside from the frozen grocery store pizza-like cheese (a sprinkle here and there), it had enough salt to melt a Chicago winter\'s thickest ice covered street in seconds.  I went here today, Sept 3rd for a late lunch.  Alright so I\'m on vacation in Scottsdale to scout locations for my future home.  I\'ve spent the past 37 years of my life in Chicago eating pizza (thin crust and stuffed) on a weekly basis.  I read about this place all over and so many people (including some deluded dude at the table next to me) kept raving about how "Chicago" this pizza is.  Oh my goodness!!!!!!!!!  If this is Chicago pizza, kill me now!  this was the worst pizza ever!  I should have known when the waiter guy (a chick appeared later) said in response to our stuffed cheese pizza order, "I don\'t recommend cheese only".  He said, "if you get cheese only its gets pockets that don\'t cook all the way and explode when you cut it".  Huh?!  He was going on about this detriment when I finally cut him off and explained that I was from Chicago, wanted to compare stuffed pizzas, never heard of this but was scared so I\'ll go with the thin crust.  My boyfriend looked puzzled but I flat out told him, "Obviously they don\'t know what they\'re doing".  Don\'t cook all the way?  Explode when you cut into it?  What?!  I appreciate his warning but wonder if he was just trying to up sell since more ingredients equals more $.  If that was the case, his strategy backfired as I went for the thin crust which was cheaper altogether.  As it turns out, I must thank him as Oregano\'s is a restaurant I wouldn\'t recommend to my worst enemy.  Bad, bad, bad pizza.  It was actually embarrassing!  As I stated earlier, I overheard a neighbor table mentioning how "Chicago" this pizza was.  He wasn\'t from Chicago but had been there and had pizza from there and thought this Oregano\'s pizza was so good. Embarrassing!  I wanted to set him straight so badly but I didn\'t.

I called on a Sunday night and was told it would be 90 minutes before I could come pick it up. I arrived right on time, and my pizza & garlic bread were pulled from an under-the-counter heater and handed over. \n\nClearly, I\'m starving having had to wait so long until dinner so I\'m pretty excited to pull the pizza out of the box and get it on to the plate once I make it back home. Though when I lifted the lid, the excitement fizzled. The pizza did not look fresh, and when I pulled out the first thin crust slice it fell limp and nearly slid itself back into the box. That was worrisome so I carefully transfered a few more squares over, then opened the foil for the garlic bread. More sogginess, and by the looks of the bread it may have been placed under my pizza box inside the pizza-kryptonite heater. Adding insult to injury, the pizza was cool! I actually had to put it in the microwave less than 10 minutes after picking it up. Seriously?!\n\nThe first bite of both were equally disappointing. It was hard to handle the pizza squares because they were so limp/soggy, and when I folded it in half the topping separated from the crust as if it had been placed there as a late afterthought. Thin crust pizza should be CRISPY! It doesn\'t qualify as "thin crust" just because the crust is thin! And I\'ve had better garlic bread come with a frozen dinner.\n\nVery disappointed. 1 - If my pizza had been ready earlier than they told me to arrive, they should have called me. They took my number when I placed the order. 2 - The phrase "Chicago-Style Pizza" should be regulated like organic and kosher. It\'s clearly being abused by this establishment.

When you are a kid, you can\'t wait to go to Chuck E. Cheese for some peperoni pizza and some fun-tivities.  When you get older, you go to a local chain pizza place for a cheap dinner with friends or a cheap date.  When you start making money, you opt for some organic, gluten-free, fair-trade, new-age pizza joint where a 12\'\' pie will cost you $60.  Oregano\'s falls somewhere in between #2 and #3.\n\nThe place itself is tiny, so get ready to wait.  And wait.  And wait a little more.  I am not certain whether you can make reservations over the phone, but I know that you can stop by and tell the host you want a table for six at 8 pm.  That\'s what we did.  If the weather is nice, you can sit outside in the back section of the Oregano\'s parking lot.  They rope off a few parking spots, put up some giant umbrellas for shade and ambiance, bring out the best washable red-and-white checkered tablecloths and . . . voila!  You\'ve got yourself an outdoor seating area. \n\nWhile you\'re waiting for the pizza, why not order their signature drink, the Bellini.  It is not the traditional Italian Bellini, which, I believe, is made with white peach puree and Prosecco.  The Oregano\'s Bellini could be best described as a slushee with cheap alcohol.  The flavors are unrecognizable, but somehow it works.  It\'s the kind of a drink that is much more likely to give you a brain freeze and a sugar rush instead of a buzz or a hangover.  We had to wait for our Bellini for a good 20 minutes because the slushee machine was on the fritz.\n\nFor the six of us, we ordered two extra large (18\'\') thin crust pizzas, a BBQ Chicken and a Hawaiian pizza.   The pizzas arrived promptly on gigantic aluminum trays . . . just like pizzas should be served in a place like Oregano\'s.  The pizzas were cut up into small squares, making it ideal for sharing.  Also, eating 20 little squares of pizza eliminates the guilt associated with eating several slices of pizza.  That\'s a huge bonus.\n\nThe pizza itself wasn\'t the best I\'ve ever had, but it wasn\'t the worst, either.  The crust was crunchy and delicious.  The toppings were just OK, and I was not impressed with the feta/mozzarella cheese combo that topped the BBQ chicken pizza.  A couple of my friends complained that the Hawaiian pizza toppings tasted moldy, but I didn\'t think so at all.  Of course, I think that pineapples belong in a fruit cocktail, not next to Canadian bacon.  \n\nOur waiter looked like a struggling college student who worked at Oregano\'s part time.  He was nice with just a slight hint of ambivalence.  He tried to make jokes, almost trying to "fit in" with our group.  It was cute in a way, although I did sense a slight hint of desperation and trying-too-hard-ness.\n\nOverall, it\'s a good place to spend time with your friends and relive your high school years, when hanging out at your local pizza parlor was cool.  We left Oregano\'s very full, even though we left a few little pizza squares on the table.  When I got back to the hotel, I got the urge to get started on my Algebra homework . . .', 'business_id': 'kFVapB4z_5VoOnYazF_ERA', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2009-03-25', 'type': 'review'}

We have friends that come in from Chico every year for the Spring training games and it's kind of a tradition to eat dinner one of the nights at Oregano's. When the toddler was born across the street, my husband walked over that night and got himself some lasagna take-out to come eat with me so now it's also a tradition for us to come here on the toddler's birthday (or thereabouts) to have some dinner and reminisce on that day so that's where we're headed tonight with our brand new three-year-old. \n\nIt's probably me, but none of their pastas really do it for me - I just don't like them heavily sauced and their pizzas are what my husband likes - cracker thin or oily and thick.

It is now served with strips of pizza crust with cheese on it.  I like to eat the dip straight and put chili oil (yes this is a standard table condiment) red pepper and parmagean cheese on the bread.\n\nFor the main course, we split a Large Thin Pesto Pizza. The crust is thin and crispy. In lieu of tomato sauce there is their great pesto sauce, large tomato slices and mozzarella cheese finish up the package.  It is cut into square, with the four corner triangles being the best pieces.\n\nThe staff is fun friendly and will to accommodate. The patio has many mechanisms in place to make it bearable on hot dry summer days, inside has high top tables and blast loud swing music.  \n\nI also enjoy the penne pesto bake, which is now in a bread bowl, pasta, cheese pesto diced tomato more cheese and a bread bowl.

And for the calorie counters, this might not be for you unless you want to throw the diet out the window for the night. There's a reason out of towners know Oregano's by name and make a visit during their vacation and there's a reason for the half an hour wait no matter what time of day or year. It's because Oregano's is glorious and an inner fat kid's paradise. \n\nWhere to begin. The atmosphere is fun. It's lively, the staff is always friendly and they make it a point to be cheesy, Italian and enthusiastic all in one visit. Classic movies play on the tv screens and tunes play over the radio. If (or when) there's a wait, staff walks around with sample pizzas to munch on and get that appetite rolling. \n\nThe food ... oh the food. Be prepared to walk in and immediately start drooling with hunger regardless of when your last meal occurred. You should also be prepared to roll (not walk) out and be so full and satisfied only a nap will suffice. \n\nMenu Musts \n\n- Starters - The garlic cheese bread \n- Salad - Pablo Picasso \n- Pasta - Zany Ziti or Pesto Baked \n- Lunchtime - Heck of a slice \n- Pizza - Anything goes...depends on your mood. I prefer the thin to the thick pizza choice, but if you're really hungry go for the thick...or just eat more of thin.\n- Dessert - A pizza cookie of course. They also offer peanut butter chocolate and you can do half and half. \nSandwiches - Turkey Stuffed \n\nI think I just gained five pounds writing this review, but I don't regret a word I wrote.", 'business_id': 'kFVapB4z_5VoOnYazF_ERA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2010-11-16', 'type': 'review'}

This used to be my thing and I sometimes find myself falling off the wagon.  Oregano's certainly helps.\n\nEverything here is big: the menu, the portions, the wait for a table.  The actual restaurant itself is rather small and split across two structures with a meager parking lot in the middle.  The Phoenix location has a more sensical layout, but is just as crazy busy.  We also call it Gaytalian, whereas the Scottsdale location is just Italian.\n\nMy one recommendation is to not get an appetizer.  The garlic bread is massive and gooey, the guacatoni is guacalicious and the fried ravioli are just the right abuse of a deep fryer.  However, if you do get a starter you will never get to dessert still able to consume food.  Remember those big portions?  The meal will do you in and you will miss the best part of Oregano's - The Pizookie.  It's a cookie that's not fully baked and topped with ice cream.  You should try all three flavors: Chocolate Chip, Peanut Butter Chocolate, and White Chocolate.\n\nOh, yea.  The main food.  The lasangas are stellar, specifically the artichoke one.  The salads are the weak spot, but the meatball sub had four bulldozer-sized soft meatballs.  I usually go for the deep dish pizza stuffed with unending amounts of cheese, but the flat pizzas have more variety and work well to share.  That's the big thing here.  Share or risk massive waist expansion.\n\nAnd if you care to drink, you need to have a bellini.  It's a frozen drink of wonder and has schnapps, rum, wine, and champagne.  It's like the whole bar in one glass.  \n\nIt's important to recognize that going to Oregano's is an event and will take time.  However, with the friendly servers, the constant access to beverages, and the cool Chicago Italian decorations, you won't mind the time.", 'business_id': 'kFVapB4z_5VoOnYazF_ERA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2010-11-30', 'type': 'review'}

The bar was ear-piercingly loud with most of the patrons screaming to be heard over the other patrons.

What? Ive worked and still work in the industry for 20 years and have never heard of such a rule. He was probably afraid that he wouldnt get tipped.  We were hoping to be out in time for fireworks so right when we sat down my friend tells Heather, our server, that he\'ll have the lasagne due to the fact that he knows it takes 45 minutes. She put in the order and when she came back, we were all ready to order. 2 people ordered a salad , 1 guy got a pasta dish and the other 2 of us decided on pizza. We were told the stuffed takes an hour so we opted for the thin crust. She says "do you guys want things as they come up"? We said "No, we want to have dinner together" (Thats why we all went there TOGETHER, duh). She says she\'ll "time it out best she can". So, after 45 minutes pass, he gets his lasagne and nobody elses food comes up. So, we wait and wait. 20 minutes more pass and we havent seen our server, a manager, or our food. (Lasagne got cold, by the way). He gets up and goes to ask the manager where our food and/or server are and hes told " you got your food and you guys have drinks, so your good, right?" An hour and 40 minutes after we sat down, we all had food ready and asked to have it boxed so we could try to catch fireworks. (Which we missed because Heather isnt very good at "timing it out". She also obviously lacks communication because if she wouldve just came to our table and told us what happened which is obvious, she tried to time it right for us but forgot to put in the rest of the order and didnt realize it til the lasagne came up, we wouldve been fine. She avoided our table instead and the jackass of a manager didnt even try  to help the situation. He was completely unprofessional and said something to her in front of us. What a jerk! 4 out of the 6 people at that table are industry people and have been there and made the same mistake. We totally wouldve understood but the way this was handled was horrible. To boot, as we left, they said in unison..very snidely I might add...

I admit, I didn\'t order any pizza, so if that\'s what you should go there for, I\'ll have to make another visit.\n\nBut I\'ve heard good things about their food in general and I was completely unimpressed. I ordered the beefstro salad with a "LARGE" amount of shaved rib-eye. There was nothing of the sort. Yeah, there was meat, but let\'s not go overboard by saying a LARGE amount in all caps. It was mediocre at best. Plus, my boyfriend\'s meatball sandwich came out literally 10 minutes before my food. He was almost done when I got my meal. That\'s a huge no-no at a restaurant. I was extremely annoyed. His meatball sandwich was nothing special. Seems no restaurant makes legit meatballs, just some canned bullshit that tastes generic. To top it all off, when my boyfriend was offered sweet potato fries or waffle fries, the server failed to tell him it was a $1 more for sweet potato fries. I guess it\'s on the menu, but if you\'re going to make it sound like it\'s an equivalent choice of sides, how should we know? You have to make that clear when offering. Duh.\n\nThe server was friendly and the overall atmosphere seemed nice, but that was a fairly lame experience.

We realized that we were driving into the haboob so we decided to pull over and duck into the nearest place we could find. I was in great despair at where we found ourselves since I had just started a new low-carb diet and also wasn't drinking. But I ended up having a great meal anyway. \n\nWe sat in the bar since all the tables in the restaurant area were full. But this worked out great since the bar has a big window overlooking Scottsdale Road so we were able to monitor the storm's progress. The place was packed but had a good, lively vibe since all the servers were very friendly and seemed to be having a good time in spite of being at work. I was all set to order one of the sandwiches without bread but the bartender suggested ordering just a side of some meatballs and sauce. This is considered an add-on to the pasta dishes and so it was only $3.99. Such a great deal for a really yummy dinner! My companion got some kind of chicken sandwich and a glass of wine which she really enjoyed. The sand which came with sweet potato fries and she said that she didn't care for them but I managed to stay strong and not sample any so I can't really comment on how good they are. Overall, a pleasurable evening, in spite of the storm and the place being very crowded. \n\nPS: An added perk that made the visit even more enjoyable (well, at least for my friend who is a reality TV junkie) is that one of the servers was Alex from Real World Denver.", 'business_id': 'kFVapB4z_5VoOnYazF_ERA', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2011-08-23', 'type': 'review'}

Its common knowledge that there are excessive waits here at Oregano\'s and I assumed that is due to the high quality pizza coming from the kitchen. Well, unless you have a few hours to burn you are not going to find out.\nI sat at the bar as I arrived solo and the bartender was friendly and quick. As I looked at the menu and asked for suggestions she alerted me that most items were about an hour wait or sometimes 45 minutes. That being said the only thing you can get in under 30 minutes is their famous "pizza on a cracker" dish. They suggest ordering your food while you sit outside waiting for you table. "That\'s how the regulars do it". Apparently this is due to the great pizza shortage in Arizona.\nIts not cheap and there is nothing I can see that makes it unique other than they expect you to wait an hour for a 10" pizza. \nThey augment their hard to read menu by NOT offering Calzone or Stromboli. And as an added plus there is not a TV in the joint with any sports whatsoever. (All the TV\'s show some type of 1940\'s movie reel) \nThis was a Sunday night during the NFL season when the World Series was also being played but I enjoyed the black and white silent movie instead........\nHow nostalgic! Well that is if nostalgic means sucks. \n\nAnd if that was not enough 6 minutes after I ordered a simple pepperoni biscuit I asked about appetizers realizing I would not see the biscuit for 28 minutes.\nI ordered BOOM chips and BOOM they never arrived. I promptly cancelled the boom when the pizza arrived. Less boom more pffftt.\n\nOregano\'s reminds me of Bucco de Beppo but for pizza......And without the positives that Bucco has, whatever those are???\n\nWith all this nonsense I just found myself wanting to bail quickly and even left 3/4 of a beer behind. (Amazing) But the manager did inquire why I did not want to take the remainder of the grease biscuit with me and seemed genuinely concerned. The bartender was also very nice.\n\nThe kitchen and time to plate are the Achilles heel. \n\nPlease don\'t tell me this is the best Arizona can do for pizza.

I have never had a more positive dining experience than I have tonight ANYWHERE.  The server was truly amazing.  I have been to this Oregano's many times as well as others and have always enjoyed it, but this time, they went above and beyond.  I encourage all Yelpers to try this pizza joint.  Their pasta and salads are also great.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo Whom It May Concern,\n\nI just felt it important to take the time to write regarding an amazingly positive dining experience my husband and I had this evening at the restaurant near Scottsdale & Shea.\n\nWe came into the restaurant a little bit after 9:30pm knowing you'd be closing at 10:00pm.  I was concerned we may be upsetting the staff for coming in so late when they were probably looking forward to leaving for the evening, preparing to clean up, etc.\n\nNothing could have been further from the truth.  Our server, Scott, was phenomenal.  You are lucky to have him.  He was so welcoming, attentive, and made sure everything was perfect regarding our visit.  \n\nI should mention, we are no stranger to Oregano's.  We have been coming there for years and visited nearly every location in the valley at one time or another.  I have also celebrated many a birthday there.\n\nI just wanted to say that the service from Scott tonight was the best service I think I've ever had at ANY Oregano's or any other restaurant for that matter.  You are lucky to have him on your staff.  It is my hope that you will not lose him one day to Mastro's or something.  \n\nAmazing service made our ordinary night extraordinary & when I finish here, I am going to write a terrific review on YELP.  Keep up the great work you do . . . oh yeah . . . & give Scott a bonus or something, would ya???  ;-)  \n\nWith Sincere Appreciation,\n\nKate S.", 'business_id': 'kFVapB4z_5VoOnYazF_ERA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2012-11-29', 'type': 'review'}

We were told there would be a 5 to 10 minute wait. We walked in and there were several tables that were available in the bar area. The waiter told us we need the hostess to sit us in the bar area. So in about 10 minutes she finally seated us at the table we were sitting at anyway. Then our waiter finally came back stating his was not our waiter but will be taking our drink order, we just ordered water. We order a salad we were thinking of splitting the large and ask the waiter, he stated that the salad was large enough to feed all three of us  which included him.  He then staed we should just orde two small dinner salads which would have been around 6. 50 so we opted for the large sald for 5.99. It was good and fresh and the Chipolte dressing was good and spicy. The pizza took over 45 mins thin crust we ordered half Lawrence and half N\xfamero Ono it came out Luke warm, the crust was paper thin and burnt black on the edges and skimpy toppings. My boyfriend said his side had good flavor, but I could not taste much of anything, the fresh Parmesan was a good touch. When we inquired about the pizza crust being burnt the waitress stated that it was our fault for ordering 2 different sides on the pizza, never had a problem like this at other places Grazies, or Grimaldi 's. We thought that she was rude and full of herself, we also noticed that the music was so loud we had a hard time hearing ourselves. Oregano's use to be my favorite place , but the last few times I have been there food , service is not very good, I think oregano's need to focus on good customer service and food quality control. I doubt we will be back, Grazies is still number one on our list, great food and service.", 'business_id': 'kFVapB4z_5VoOnYazF_ERA', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2013-01-02', 'type': 'review'}

It's a skillet baked cookie that's just every so slightly underdone so that it's soft and gooey...and then they top it with ice cream. Can you say heaven in a skillet??

We were looking forward to a great thin crust pizza- but after hearing the ravs of this place, I have to say I was very disappointed. First of all, it was almost cold. It must have sat there at least 5-10 min out of the oven before they brought it.  The flavor was quite bland.  I can tell you at least 10 different places in the valley with tastier pizza than this. In fact, Paul Newman's FROZEN Margerita pizza is better than this - it is better tasting, crust,  toppings, and you don't have to sit on hard  wood chairs for 45 minutes waiting for it. Ok so we wanted some dessert -so how about some cheesecake?  They don't have any - first Italian place I have ever been in that doesn't have cheesecake.  So we get the cookie- wait another 25 minutes. Nothing special... So after 2.5 hours including the wait for the table - and $65 - wow- I can say this was a total disappointment.

This is always a good thing, one of my favorite pizza joints, Gimaldi's, is located just down the street from my hotel. Only this time I decided to give someone else's pizza a shot. I had seen Oregano's a number of times but had never stopped in. That was until now; I made a left instead of a right and hit Oregano's. It was a bit chilly but chose to sit outside since there were patio heaters. The outdoor seating area was quite nice, but a little close to the road making it a bit noisy. \n\nLooking at the menu I saw Oregano's offered numerous dishes, they all look very tasty. They also offer thick crust Chicago style pizza, in addition thin crust is also offered.  That's good because I'm a thin crust guy. Since this was my first visit I ordered thin crust cheese, in my view the basic cheese pizza is the true test for any pizzeria. After a short wait my pizza arrived. It looked very good, very thin crust but over dressed with cheese. Interestingly while it was the traditional round pie, it was cut into squares verse the usual wedges. However the real test is how it tastes. It was very good, better than most pizzerias. That said it wasn't perfect. It was over dressed with cheese, which in turn made it just a bit greasy. Still make no mistake, this is very good pizza, maybe even bordering on excellent. Yet there is on huge problem. Oregano's is located only about a mile from Gimaldi's. In my view Gimaldi's doesn't serve very good or even excellent pizza, they serve extraordinary pizza. Prices are virtually identical. For me it's a no brainer if in the area, its Gimaldi's for pizza. Maybe the only way I would choose Oregano's over Gimaldi's would be if I wanted something other than pizza. Oregano's also seems a bit more on the casual fun side.\n\nAt Oregano's you'll find a very good pie, just keep in mind if pizza is what you crave it isn't the best.

We, just he and I, ordered the Big Beefsro Salad to share. In terms of size, we were not disappointed, the salad was HUGE. But we did not like the flavors at all. We each maybe had 4 or 5 bites, which barely touched the salad, and had to order something else. Our waitress asked if we liked it and we informed her we couldn't eat it. She commented on how little of it we ate, that it barely looked touched and took it away. We ordered our normal pizza, and ate that just fine. When we received the bill the salad was on it, so I asked our server if there was any way we could remove it, or at least discount it, since we didn't even eat it. She looked at us and walked away to the bar filled someone Else's drink and came back to check if we were ready to pay. \nIn the end we paid for it, and left, still tipped her well, even if she wasn't willing to help us. \n\nOther than that one experience though, every time we go in we are treated very well. It's always busy at dinner time, so come early!

Obviously I am one of the few people who doesn't think this place is that great. Once you are seated at an Italian restaurant most places have complimentary bread or something to hold you over for a while especially when you are waiting forever to get your food. To be fair they have $4 garlic bread which is pretty huge and tasty. As someone who drinks a lot of soda I appreciated the massive drink cups they have. The food came out and a few people were underwhelmed that they waiting as long as they did for what they got. The staff was friendly so that was at least nice.

However, this is strictly a review based upon my personal experience as a paying customer, outside the fact that I am a former employee. The food here is spectacular, especially if you are looking for a good thin crust pizza cooked to perfection and loaded with toppings. One of my favorites is the "Bistro Classic" (a simple pizza, white garlic butter sauce, tomatoes and basil) which is fabulous with additional meats such as the Cajun chicken. Any and all of their thin crust pizzas are marvelous, depending on your topping preferences. However, the bottoms of the pizzas tend to cook to a crisp, if this is not something you\'re fond of as I myself am, make a request to your waiter/waitress for a lighter bake. I highly suggest trying their Medium/Gold wings with a side of ranch or bleu cheese, "Guacatony" with beef added on the crispy pizza chips, and the "Oregano\'s Favorite" Mediterranean inspired salad. The wait, bar, host and take out staff are attentive and accommodating. This is a quirky environment for family gatherings, celebratory events, or even a date night with the other half. The wait times are rather high at almost every lunch or dinner hour, for the mere fact that the food and service is so outstanding! Be prepared to have one person from your party arrive in advance to be placed on the waiting list. Though I am very satisfied in my current place of employment, Oregano\'s will forever remain my favorite company I\'ve worked for, as they truly press upon the customer service aspect and helped me to find the confidence and sincerity in myself.', 'business_id': 'kFVapB4z_5VoOnYazF_ERA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2014-03-20', 'type': 'review'}

Our server came to the table right after we sat and asked us what he could get for us. We both asked for water and my boyfriend ordered a Sam Adams seasonal. When the server returned with our drinks he asked us if we were ready to order. Since we had not been there before we took a while to decide on food. So the server gave us more time to decide. While he was gone we both sipped the beer and it was flat and undrinkable. The server came back moments later and started talking to us about the menu and making recommendations. We finally settled on the Margherita pizza and after we put in our order our server was no where to be found. We sat there 40 minutes watching others come in and order their food. We still did not get our pizza and could not find our server so we finally just got up and left. A host said goodbye to us on the way out but did not ask us how our meal was. My boyfriend and I both work in a restaurant so we understand slow ticket times when a restaurant is busy, but being one of only a few tables there was just unacceptable.

I ordered food from here several times a week (pick up for lunch) and would meet friends or bring a date here about 1x a month. So.... I can't chalk up this bad review to 1 experience. This place is truly getting bad.\nNormally, I place an order for pickup and am pretty well taken care of regardless of how busy they are. The last several times I've ordered, everyone plays hot-potato with taking care of my pick up... sometimes I'm waiting for 10 minutes for the bartender or the person who took my order while several servers are pretending to be busy because it's not their problem. \nIn addition, I've noticed that my regular order (wings) has gone down-hill quite a bit. $10.00 for 10 wings is expensive to start with ... but, until recently, they were always huge, so I never felt ripped off. Wings have gotten much smaller and whoever is in the kitchen doesn't mind giving you a half wing or a runt here and there. Today was the final straw... they raised the price and my order was inadequate. \nAt the end of the day, it's no longer enough to eat nor a value for the money.  \n\nNote to owner or manager: \nI want to eat here and give you my money.  Please hire and train staff that are at least willing to provide service and take it from me. Also, stop watering down the soup and raising prices. I've seen a 100 places come and go in Old Town.

It was opening day then and the next few weeks tables were easy to garner but that changed, as "Oregano\'s" started to earn its place in the future history of famous Arizona Restaurants. It began to get tougher and tougher to get a table even as we watched this tiny Bistro expand to a mini compound, and soon to be pretty a darn successful regional chain.\n\nAlthough I have enjoyed hundreds of meals with friends and family during the last 3 decades, and waited as many hours for a table, it has been years since I have been in. That changed last night and although tradition was shattered, I was stoked to be immediately whisked to a big table in the corner with NO WAIT! \n\nSo on to last nights visit, I first notice that the dining experience starts in the driveway, the building looks great, and music was in the air. upon entering our greeting was welcoming and efficient. The walk through the dining room was fun, and although a little Disneyesque, it felt like we were entering and old time, big city Italian restaurant, It\'s pretty, vibrant and smelt delicious.\n\nWe were lead to a great big table in the corner and menus placed for us so we could sit and stare at the wall, we took the initiative to scoot around to the back so we could people watch and take in this neat space and vibrant energy. Soon into dinner and coincidentally good friends were seated across from us. That was nice, and its casual enough that standing and talking for a few minutes wasn\'t a problem for this casual environment.\n\nMy buddy said "wings" I got this, I said... Italian Gold with a side of the hot sauce were ordered with our beverages. The wings arrived late, after the sandwiches, but they still tasted EXACTLY as I remembered. Delicious. I snuck the order in with beverages cause I knew they took a while. I would have loved to start with them rather then eat along side of entr\xe9es. Although blamed on long cooking times ( I knew that) this was the only service mis-step. The rest of our service was so good that we left a fat tip for our friendly server.\n\nOverall everything we ordered was delicious, and prepared well, with the exception of the Cole slaw and Giardinara that came with our sandwiches. The slaw was so finely chopped I thought it was Ice berg lettuce. It was Ice cold and had a unique flavor and I ate it all, it was a more visual and textural thing, and the Giardinara may have been from the bottom of the barrel or just not as I remembered, It was all okra and peppers, just all dark green, Not really a problem just not great. It was especially nice to see that prices are still very reasonable and portions every bit as big as always.\n\nI am not sure why it\'s been so long since I have been, but It wont be long, till I get back.', 'business_id': 'kFVapB4z_5VoOnYazF_ERA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2015-11-04', 'type': 'review'}
