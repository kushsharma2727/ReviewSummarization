Our regular Friday Night gang met there last night for the last of their "soft openings."  In the interest of full disclosure, our dinner was comped, and was mostly limited to the evening\'s featured "softie" - burgers.  I say mostly, because when we got there, late, victims of the traffic that engulfed the Strip due to the influx of CES tourists, our friends were already gorging on a plate of raw oysters, and that wasn\'t on the list we were given.   We, too, were coming from the Convention center, and it took us 45 minutes to get to Caesar\'s, then another 10 to get the car valet\'d, since that, too, was full.\n\nHubster and I don\'t eat oysters, so our friends managed to convince them to bring us shrimp.  And gawd, those were the biggest damned shrimp I\'ve ever seen.  They were terrific.\n\nThe real freebie consisted of wine or beer, burgers, fries, and salad.  We\'re white wine drinkers, and there was no Riesling, just Chardonnay and Pino Grigio.  The Pino was super dry, so I had some Merlot.  The salad was one big disappointment, just a pile of ugly greens with a few thin slices of the tiniest baby radish I ever could imagine.  Your eight bucks won\'t get you anything else, not even a crouton.\n\nThe burgers were great - fresh, meaty, not oversalted - but the buns were just ordinary.  I ordered mine with Vermont cheddar, sauteed onions, and mushrooms.  Toppings are $1.20 each, so that brought the burger close to $14, which I guess is par for the Strip, which is why we stick mostly local.  I also ordered a cup of coffee, and it was cold.\n\nWhat really drowned this place for us, though, was the water, pun intended.  The waiter asked whether we all wanted water.  I said "no," but got it anyway.  It was served in small glasses slightly larger than juice glasses, with no logo.  There was no brand to approve, no cork to sniff, no swirling nor sniffing.  Yet when we got the pretend bill, we noticed that THEY CHARGED FOR THE WATER!!!  What the hell are they thinking???  Has Lake Mead become a designer label??  And that, dear reader, is my death knell for this restaurant.\n\nThe service was spotty.  The place wasn\'t more than one-third full, yet our waiter had some trouble keeping up and getting things right.  Service picked up tremendously when Marty, who said he was a busser, joined the team.  A young and earnest full-time Type A, he went over and above to see that we were satisfied.  He was definitely worth the price of admission.\n\nP.J. Clarke\'s is a venerable New York institution, in business since 1884, and that\'s no typo.  They\'re suddenly pushing to go national - they have a branch in Chicago, one that just opened in D.C., and now, Vegas.  I tried to check the website to see what the full menu is like, but the links on the Vegas page aren\'t working, at least on Firefox and Chrome.  (I don\'t go near IE).  IMHO, this is symbolic of the lengths they\'ll need to travel to distinguish themselves from all the competition in this town.  And if they persist in charging for tap water, it\'s going to be a long road to travel.', 'business_id': 'qpo6O2Ozbrn8wFnoCM4slA', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2011-01-08', 'type': 'review'}

It has long been known as "The Vatican of Saloons". Old-fashioned New York vintage style with a 125-year history of service in three locations in the City of New York, in S\xe3o Paulo Brazil and in Washington, D.C. It boasts of a Raw Bar as well as a known Saloon. Wine, beer, and alcoholic spirits are served from its full bar with a background of mutiple visual screens, visible from the restaurant\'s frontage. Moreover, I could watch football and other sport events on their wide screens by the bar.\n\nCoool! An intimate setting with romantic lighting over red and white checkered table cloths on the tables. Booth-type seatings are of soft red leather. Shiny mahogany wood furnishings. A short tour by the restaurant\'s host gave me the opportunity to see more of the restaurant. A VIP room for special reservations and private affairs is located in the rear of the restaurant where a full bar and table settings for 50 people is cozy for any private occasions. A set of glass doors opens up to this room. This room is provided privacy from the second dining room by its glass wall. Through open doorways to the far left of the second dining area is where food is freshly made. Wait staff and Kitchen staff can be seen bustling and hustling to and fro as they meet up with the dining patron\'s needs. On the right side of the restaurant upon entering, is where the host and cashier is situated alongside an open Raw Seafood Bar. It\'s well-lit and have iced-laid displays of popular seafood like oysters, clams, and shrimps. Lobsters steamed or wood-grilled, Fish and Chips, as well as Salmon and Mussels are on the menu\'s entrees. Sandwiches, Salads, Appetizers, Soups, popular P.J. Clarke\'s Hamburgers are all natural vegetarian Angus Beef with the necessary toppings and extras, Eggs Benedict, Chicken Pot Pie, Ribs, and popular sides such as Asparagus, Mushrooms, Onion Rings, Sweet Potato Fries are its menu\'s American fare. Desserts of Pies, Ice Cream, Pudding and Cheesecake are also featured on the menu. New York Cheesecake?\n\nThis is a favorite New York City seafood, bar and steakhouse venue, so good that it is now in Vegas where Maine Lobster, Raw Oysters, Shrimps, Clams, Prime Steaks, Filet Mignons, Shepherd\'s Pie, Rib Eye Steaks are established main entrees. One of my  favorites, "Bacon Wrapped Dates" is on the menu. I could just come on over for Lobster, Seafood and Steak prepared New York style.\n\nPossibly hard to locate as it is on the Lower Level next to spiral elevators in Caesar\'s Palace\'s Forum Shops. Hours of operation is from 11 a.m. to 12 midnight or until 2 a.m. depending on diners\' presence according to restaurant host. Nevertheless, I noticed two quotations painted over on its low dining rooms\' dividing walls. A quotation from Benjamin Franklin caught my eyes. It states that "Beer proves that God loves us and wants us to be happy". I asked the hosts to repeat them for me because some dining patrons have covered my view of the whole quotation. Not one of the best quotes I ever seen because alcoholic drinks is not my sought-after beverages but it brought a smile to my face. Sounds like this is a place where everyone will know your name.

We walked through the Forum shops and stumbled upon PJ Clarke's.  Given that it didn't have music blasting, a crazy-looking clientele or a line, we walked up to the menu board to check it out.  What we saw made us walk in.\n\nOur server(s) made us stay.\n\nPretty much every person working tonight stopped by to check on us.  Most of them were eager to share their favorites, share a story or offer us something else.  At first, I thought I was going to be annoyed, but later I appreciated the genuine honesty and desire to serve of the staff.  \n\nWe split a crab cake.  It was, in a word, delicious.  For the price, however, it had better be!  The crab cakes is mostly crab, there was only a slight crust on the top.  \n\nJeff ordered fresh clams and oysters.  He said that they were fresh and good.  (I was slightly grossed out watching him eat them.)  \n\nJeff had a burger.  He inhaled it, so I assume that it was good.  Rather than get fries, he asked for sauteed spinach.  It was fresh-tasting and perfectly cooked.  \n\nI originally was going to order the fish and chips, but they had run out.  The waitress, Lisa, suggested the trout.  \nOh my goodness.  It was unlike any fish I've ever tried.  It is pan fried, in a cast iron skillet.  On top, they have sliced potatoes, bacon, capers and mushrooms.  I know that it sounds strange, but it is absolutely delicious.  I asked for a few pretzel rolls.  They came with a bit of dijon butter.  All of that together, even better.  I almost licked the plate.  \nIt would have been a perfect meal, had I not found a piece of plastic wrap under the fish.  No big deal.  I had already finished, but I did want to let our waitress know, so that the kitchen can be more careful.  \nLisa took the fish off the bill.  Super class!  \n\nI will return here, the next time I am in town.", 'business_id': 'qpo6O2Ozbrn8wFnoCM4slA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2011-01-30', 'type': 'review'}

I've been to PJ Clarke's in NYC a few times so I wanted to see how this was. \n\nThe location on the 1st floor of the newer Forum Shops area is kinda weird but the set up is pretty nice. I can't believe Villa Reale was in the same spot a year ago. \n\nIt was pretty easy to find 2 stools at the bar. Beer prices were standard for the strip. I can't justify paying $7 for a pint of Miller Lite so I opted for $10 bottles of Duvel. You're pretty buzzed after 3 of those babies. \n\nThe bar has an interesting widescreen TV built into the wall. Its a set of 8 screens that combine into one and can separate to 2, 4 or 8 things showing. It looks like a mirror when the TV is off which is kinda cool. The lines between the screens still annoyed my when watching the game on the full screen though. The bartender told me the bar was able to obtain this pre CES and its the only place in the US to have one. He also said it cost more than 6 figures to purchase and install which is kinda crazy. \n\nWe also got an order of fried calamari Rhode Island style which had a lot of hot peppers on it and tasted great. This is also the only place I've ever ordered calamari where no tentacles were served. I dig the tentacles!! \n\nRaw bar looked awesome but its hard to compete with Joe's right across the way. The bartender also said they haven't done any marketing for the place yet. What's taking so long?", 'business_id': 'qpo6O2Ozbrn8wFnoCM4slA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2011-01-31', 'type': 'review'}

It was well seasoned and not tough, order the sauce with a little spice (can\'t remember the name) on the side as it goes perfect with the steak. Along with the skirt steak I had the french onion soup which had a great sherry taste and lots of onion. I would definitely recommend it with your meal. \n\nIf you don\'t want to do "fine dining" and are tired of gorging at the buffets, this place has a varied menu and is worth checking out if you are in the Caesars Palace area. I wouldn\'t make a special trip to go here, however as I thought it was somewhat overpriced.', 'business_id': 'qpo6O2Ozbrn8wFnoCM4slA', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2011-02-05', 'type': 'review'}

Huh?? I've lived in Las Vegas for over 20 years and I've never heard this and I've never had a problem with antibiotics being less than effective.

SERIOUSLY, what kind of a pretentious jerk says that? my boyfriend asked to talk to the chef if it was going to be a problem, but the waiter quickly said he would take care of it.  finally we get our food.  somehow the steak is dry as hell and bland, weird because it was ordered medium cooked.  everything else tasted pretty good, the problem was that both people who ate the fish and chips, ended up with the runs and it defintiely was not from anything else they'd eaten earlier.  it just was a sucky experience. one of the few times yelp really let me down.  :(", 'business_id': 'qpo6O2Ozbrn8wFnoCM4slA', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2011-09-21', 'type': 'review'}

Many are recommendations from readers, while some are from articles in local papers touting the \'best unknown burger\' or something like that. PJ Clarke\'s is one such place. I didn\'t remember where the suggestion came from walking in, but our waitress reminded us that the Las Vegas Weekly had claimed theirs the \'best burger in Las Vegas.\' Do I agree?\n\nThe answer is no. The burger is definitely good, but in no way is it the \'best\', and I really hate claims like this. I won\'t get into too much of the history of the restaurant, which dates back to 1884 in New York. You can read about it on their site without me having to repeat it. As for the Vegas location, it\'s located in the evil Forum Shops at Caesar\'s Palace. I say evil because if you are a local and have ever tried to park there you surely haven\'t forgotten that awful experience. And to top it off, the restaurant is located at the Las Vegas Blvd end so you have to walk completely across the mall to get there through lumbering tourists and smelly fountains.\n\nFor a place that supposedly has the "Cadillac of burgers", the burger section is pretty minimal and far down on the menu. You aren\'t presented with many options for your 100% Black Angus burger, just a series of cheeses, and a few additional options for a fee like bacon, B\xe9arnaise sauce, a fried egg, etc. There is only one pre-configured burger on the menu, predictably titled "The Cadillac", which has smoked country bacon and American cheese. Sides are a-la-carte, so I was asked if I wanted regular or sweet potato fries with it. Of course I went with the regular to keep this meal as consistent as possible with others.\n\nThe burger came out with a nice buttery, grilled brioche bun, two thick pieces of bacon, a thin but tasty pickle slice, tomatoes and far too much lettuce. It wasn\'t until after I assembled my burger and picked it up did I notice a full slice of an onion hiding below. Our waitress later explained that back in the day the first restaurant in New York served their food on paper plates and this was a way to keep the juices from the burger sogging up the plate. Nice touch of tradition, but kind of odd.\n\nThe burger was tastier than I anticipated at first bite; it was juicy, the bun had good flavor, and the cheese was melted. The meat on its own was ok, it had kind of the generic meat flavor that comes with your standard Angus and could have maybe used a little seasoning. I ordered medium rare, but it was a bit too grey in the middle compared to my friend\'s that was more pink than mine for only being ordered medium. The burger dripped some juice during the first few bites and stopped maybe halfway through, but luckily didn\'t really dry out the burger as I got to the end. One thing that I found odd during the meal was that I kept hitting weird pockets of saltiness as I took bites. Initially I thought it might be from the bacon, but I think it was just the meat as my friend didn\'t have bacon on his and made the same salt comment.\n\nThe bun was well proportioned to the meat, I found that I had just enough of both. The bacon was slightly undercooked and didn\'t quite have that crunch I\'d hope for, but was still very flavorful and fit well. As I said the cheese was melted which is still not always easy for some places, but might have contributed to a bit of the saltiness. The fries might have been a tiny bit undercooked, but had good flavor until they got cold which happened sort of quickly. They had that good \'natural\' flavor that I like, much better than what is attempted in a similar style at somewhere like Five Guys.\n\nNow for the bad... I have to say the overall price of the meal was a little high due to the fact that my a-la-carte fries were $6.60!! I\'m fine with the $14.60 burger based on the strip location and even what was presented to me, but the fry price is a bit out of hand, and pushes the burger past $20 which I think is a bit high. The service was great; I think we had two different managers come by our table and ask if everything was ok. And our waitress Justina was extremely friendly, knew a great deal about the history of the restaurant, and also provided us with our onion explanation. All that being said, I think $21 is a bit much for a burger, unless maybe it really was the \'best burger in Vegas.\' I personally hate going to the strip these days, but if you don\'t mind or already find yourself at Caesar\'s, the overall restaurant, service and food are worth it if you\'re willing to cough up a bit too much money to sample what is supposedly the best in town. As we already know, there are worse places on the strip.', 'business_id': 'qpo6O2Ozbrn8wFnoCM4slA', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2011-10-23', 'type': 'review'}

Clarke\'s main dining room.  It was an eye opener, because before this meal I didn\'t know that this establishment was a fine bastion of comfort food. \n\nWe opened with what turned out to be the only discordant note of the evening: Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail.  The Cocktail Sauce was great, but for only 4 large shrimps at over $18 for the dish, the shrimp had better be great, too!  And, unfortunately for us and the rating for this review, these crustaceans were only mediocre.  Although they looked fine enough, they were tough, hard, and had little flavor.  But the meal was far from over, and I still kept an open mind after our stumbling start.\n\nWhat a great recovery!  The excellent French Onion Soup Gratinee that I was served was sweet and delicious--maybe the best I\'ve ever savored of hundreds I\'ve tried from coast to coast and around the world, since this is one of my favorite dishes and I order it almost every time I see it on a restaurant menu.  Our server, Anthony, said that the onions are sweated separately before they are put in the soup, and the cheese is a combination of Gruyere and Swiss, with the top browned with Parmesan.  As a photo reveals, this soup was bursting with cheese on the edges of the crock, and visible bubbles on the cheese covering glistened as if heralding that something special would be found inside.  Carefully breaking through the cheese with a knife, hot broth, a well-melted crouton, and well-caramelized onions came to view.  The broth was hearty and melded well with the cheese that fell inside along with the soup\'s other ingredients.  Not a hint of bitterness was detected in the dish.  The white crock in which the soup was served was large but I would not have minded if its bottom had been endless.\n\nNext for me was a Chicken Pot Pie.  It arrived in a white elongated dish that was shaped much like a shark.  The doughy top of the pot pie was tanned and taut.  It wasn\'t smoking at all.  But I needn\'t have been concerned.  For, when I broke through the thin crust, the contents were piping hot and truly delicious: a generous amount of white chicken meat, potato chunks, and carrot and celery bits, all combined in a tasty and creamy White Sauce.\n\nAfter recent repeated disappointments in landing a medium-rare hamburger at different establishments in town, Diane was thrilled with her medium-rare Cadillac Burger, containing tasty bacon and a slice of American Cheese.  When the cheeseburger was cut in half, you could clearly see the redness across the middle of the 8-oz. burger, as another photo discloses.  I tasted the burger, and it was juicy and delicious even on a plain bun, which is the way my vegetable-hating wife likes her burgers.  And, even the accompanying French Fries tasted great!  Plus, there are always the Tater Tots available to opt for next time.\n\nWe finished with a delicious shared Bread Pudding a la Mode finished with a very nice La Creme Bourbon Sauce that a diner can pour out to his or her desire, and Cinnamon Ice Cream.  The ice cream was pretty scanty, and we got through it before the dish was half-finished.  So, I requested more.  It was quickly brought to the table without extra charge.\n\nService by Anthony and his assistant was excellent throughout the meal.  Extra ice was even provided in an extra glass without request to refresh my Iced Tea.  Great comfort food at a high but fair price for the quality of ingredients, and everything prepared and baked in house!  This was a five-star experience except for our appetizer, which brought the overall rating down a notch.  Next time, it\'s oysters for me!  For, after this experience, there will definitely be a "next time" fairly soon.', 'business_id': 'qpo6O2Ozbrn8wFnoCM4slA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2011-11-16', 'type': 'review'}

Our server, smartly, took the initiative to have the kitchen split the sandwich and plate each half separately.  The shredded chicken breast was moist and tender, resting on thick slices of mozzarella cheese and tomato and topped with a flavorful basil pesto.  Unfortunately, our server misheard our lobster mac & cheese order and we received a side of regular mac & cheese instead.  When we noted the mistake, she immediately corrected the order and we received a freshly-made dish of lobster mac & cheese.  P.J. Clarke's doesn't use elbow macaroni in its lobster mac & cheese; electing to use what appeared to be orecchiette instead.  The dish was worth the wait!  It was the best lobster mac & cheese I've had the pleasure eating with its nice cheesiness and ample amount of nicely done claw meat.  A bit pricey, but not outrageous, all things considered.  P.J.

Clarke\'s to host a family member\'s 100th birthday.  As there were \nroughly 50 people attending, we chose to do a prix fixe menu in the Sidecar room.  We chose a $45 per head menu that included soup, salad, entree, 4 family-style sides and dessert.\n\nFrom the beginning, there were glitches.  We called the restaurant several (4) times to set up an appointment to discuss the menu.  No returned calls despite direct promises to call us back.  At that point, we started to reconsider our choice.  However, we finally set something up and had our menu appointment.  The staff was very apologetic but, still, not a good start.\n\nThe day of the event, the restaurant was really welcoming and let us set up in the room prior to the event.  It was great having that flexibility, we didn\'t feel pressured to get in and out.\n\nUnfortunately, when the dinner started, so did the problems.  The main problem was that they understaffed the event.  There were 2-4 servers working the event, but most were just bringing out the food.  It was really hard to get refills, silverware, etc.\n\nDuring dinner, the tomato soup, which, per the contract, was to include grilled cheese toast, did not arrive at the tables with the toast.  We asked the waitress about it and she said, with a bit of attitude, "no one told me that it was supposed to come with the soup." It was clearly on the menus sitting at every table.  So, we had to then flag down the night manager who apologized and handed out toast to everyone (she was really nice and helpful). Sadly, most people had finished their soup at that point. \n\nThen, they brought out the salads.  Many of them didn\'t have salad dressing and, once again, waiters had to be flagged down. Next, they brought the entrees, but didn\'t provide steak knives for the skirt steak.  Basic necessities were hard to come by for this meal.\n\nThe family-style sides were really laughable though.  To my table of 10, they brought 20 tater tots to share, two tiny pots of mushrooms, and14 asparagus spears.  They, once again, forgot the french fries, and when those finally arrived, it consisted of roughly two-four handfuls for the table.  Really stingy, in my opinion.  I would have preferred larger portions of just two sides.\n\nThe dessert consisted of cheesecake and cobbler.  Two slices of each per 10 person table. Yeah......\n\nI really like the sidecar room and think it\'s a great spot to host an event.  My main concern with this event was the service or lack thereof.  It was really stressful to keep running around, hunting down staff, to fix basic issues like issuing silverware and providing salad dressing.  Also, some of the staff weren\'t very friendly at times and I saw one of them giving unwarranted attitude to one of the elderly guests.  The bartender, however, was awesome and really nice to everyone.\n\nOverall, the food was good but the service was lacking.

PURE GENIUS!\n\nWith the help of my fellow yelpers, I decided to get my oyster fix here at PJ Clarkes. I was always very leery of eating oysters here in Vegas for obvious reasons but I knew that good oysters did exist in this town and it's just a matter of finding them.\n\nSo when I stumbled upon reviews for this place, I knew I had to try it out. If they were bad, at least they where only a buck a piece. \n\nI can't help but make the analogy that these $1 oysters are like the equivalent to dudes getting free drink tickets for a strip club. You're lured in by the fact that something is practically free. You scope out the place with the intention of spending the minimum amount of money because you wanna get the most bang for your buck (pun intended) and before you know it, you're popping bottles of champagne. Which is exactly what my sister and I ended up doing. Lack of willpower even though our server wasn't even doing any up selling whatsoever. It sells itself that's why this is PURE GENIUS.\n\nAnyhow, the oysters were excellent! My sister and I had 2 dozen each with champagne, of course. since we were pretty hungry going in, we decided to order a few other items:\n\nCalamari: served with hot peppers, which was the first time I've had them that way and they were mighty tasty. Gone in 60 seconds.\n\nFrench dip sandwich: TOTAL SHOW STEALER!! The best I've ever had and I had zero expectations when i ordered it. I just wanted some land-animal protein to switch it up a bit and to my pleasant surprise, this was the best French dip sandwich ever! It's always hit and miss with those things and I gave up on trying to find good ones. This one came to me and it blew my mind cuz I was coming in here for oysters. I will come back just for this sandwich alone.\n\nCrab cakes: meh, pretty standard. Not enough filler ingredients to help out the bland \ntaste of the crab meat. It also made the texture a lil too mushy.\n\nSo final check came out to be $180 for 2 chicks that came in with the intention of stretching our dollars on some cheap HH oysters. But it's all good cuz we left with big smiles on our faces and our hair tousled up a bit which meant good times had by all.", 'business_id': 'qpo6O2Ozbrn8wFnoCM4slA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2012-08-02', 'type': 'review'}

And, although it didn't strike me until I saw neighboring diners enjoying a basket of bread and butter, we were never offered any.  In retrospect my party of four probably had no room for another starch anyway.  But I believe we should have been offered the opportunity to decide this for ourselves.  Service was otherwise good, except I had to ask for Sweet & Low for my Iced Tea twice.\n\nWe began with two appetizers: excellent hot Parmesan Tater Tots and a dozen superb-tasting East Coast Oysters on the Half Shell.  I made the blunder of mistaking horseradish for garlic, so the delicious cold oysters became quite hot very quickly in my mouth, but I still enjoyed downing several light oysters as a prelude to the hearty meal to follow.\n\nThis time the Onion Soup Gratinee wasn't perfect, because the cheesy top was sunk in a bit on one side of the crock.  But, with rich beefy broth and well caramelized onions it was nearly so.  And, my Iceberg Lettuce Wedge with tasty bacon, tomatoes, and Bleu Cheese Dressing was very good and refreshing.\n\nMy Surf & Turf consisted of an 8 oz. Filet Mignon accompanied by Red Wine Sauce paired with a Maine Lobster Tail that had been lightly breaded, likely with Old Bay Seasoning.  The lobster was good with Drawn Butter but almost overcooked.  And the Filet, prepared medium rare as ordered, nicely seasoned, and enhanced by the Wine Sauce, was very good in both texture and taste.  My three dining companions all enjoyed their entrees as well.  Shared Shoestring Potatoes, Mashed Yukon Gold Potatoes, and a generous side of Sauteed Mushrooms just added to a fine repast.\n\nFor dessert we were going to split a Chocolate Creme Brulee among us, but I soon thought better of it, and privately sought out our server to tell him to charge me for TWO Chocolate Creme Brulees: one for me and one for my dining mates to share.  And, at meal's end, after enjoying the best Chocolate Creme Brulee I have ever experienced, while the rest of my table struggled to finish another, I certainly had no regrets at hogging one for myself.  Creamy, smooth, and cool, it was a magnificent close to a fine 2-1/2 hour dinner.        \n    \n4-1/2 stars overall!", 'business_id': 'qpo6O2Ozbrn8wFnoCM4slA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2012-10-26', 'type': 'review'}

The way the steak was seasoned and the clarified butter, oOoOoOoOo man it just melted in your mouth!

Did not have the oysters on happy hour so my review will not be swayed by this like everyone else's has.  First of all the service started off by two seemingly capable waiters coming over and introducing themselves.  While the restaurant was not busy at that time they somewhat obtrusively hovered about 5 feet away, multiple times asking us if we were ready to order.  We finally had to tell them that we would let them know when we were ready.  After that, service was fine until the place had many more customers then it was hit or miss getting their attention.\n    But they were by far not the most disappointing experience of the evening so that is why I generously gave them 1 star.  On the other hand the food was not even worthy of a dive bar.  The Classic Caesar salad, $9.90, was chopped romaine with a salad dressing that wouldn't even be served out of a bottle (maybe it was but who knows).  It had no real flavor of Caesar dressing and they should be ashamed of serving it. \n    Next in line was the 18oz. bone-in Delmonico Ribeye for $44.90 which two of us had.  When it came it was about 3/4 of an inch thick and clearly not weighing more than 12-14 ounces.  It was also as limp as a wet noodle with an outside that was barely showing any grill marks (I guess because it was so thin and I ordered it medium rare they couldn't leave it on the grill long enough to give it some grill flavor).  We didn't know yet that the small size would be a blessing.  With our serrated knives we then began the arduous process of cutting into this miserable waste of beef.  The  excessive amount of cartilage and fat made the task of finding an edible piece of beef like a treasure hunt.  After it was all said and done I would estimate between the small size, the bone, the fat and cartilage we probably salvaged 6 ounces of edible beef (now you see why we were glad of its size).  And this is what we payed almost $90 for a combined 12 ounces of beef.\n    Now I can understand a steak going out every now and then that may not meet expectations but for two of them to go to the same table and be equally bad is not an oversight.\n   I would not recommend this restaurant to anybody but if you do go and are planning of having one of their $45 ribeyes, bring a saw because the serrated knife didn't make the cut.", 'business_id': 'qpo6O2Ozbrn8wFnoCM4slA', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2012-11-16', 'type': 'review'}

There were about 15 orders ahead of us (that's how busy they get!) and we were able to get our oysters within 2 minutes. The second night we decided to sit at the bar where they served alcohol so we can watch the football game on the big screen. Our oysters took up to 15 minutes for each order! I didn't have a problem with the wait at all since my hubby and I were just chilling and drinking for the night.\n\nThe oysters are medium sized and shucked once your order is in. It comes with a few side sauces that you can top your oysters with as well. I ordered their crab cakes (which is not on the happy hour menu) and they tasted okay. It wasn't as meaty as I expected it to be.

Who cares what oyster farm they came from because they\'re $1 each!!   Nicely sized and pretty good!\n\nNow check out PJ\'s Famous Sliders\nhttp://bit.ly/XADMzK\nNow you know why I put quotations.  Sliders?  Are you kidding me?  To me, sliders are little burgers that you can stuff in your mouth with one or two bites.  These suckers were huuuuge!!  Very tasty and also complimented the oysters very well.  It\'s almost a steal at $1.50 each.\n\nWashed it all down with a $3 Blue Moon which is another great Happy Hour deal.  So all together, half dozen oysters, two sliders, and a Blue Moon came to a whopping $12 before tax and tip.  Awesome!!!\n\nI\'d say next to the Prime-time Bites at Palm Restaurant, this is probably one of the best Happy Hour deals on the Strip.

Yes, you heard me right - get your fill of these ocean jewels for a $1 a piece!  They are served with horseradish, mignonette, and cocktail sauce.\n\nMost recently, their happy hour has expanded to include $1.50 sliders (that are pretty tasty and decent size) and discounted drinks.  On the day we went (01.15), they also offered cod bites ($9.50), baked mac n cheese ($6.10), steak satays ($8.80), buffalo chicken lettuce wraps ($7.90), and the snack of the day ($8.40).  The snack for that day were bite-size ahi tuna tartare tacos.  There were about 7 in an order - again, fits-in-your-mouth-perfectly-size.  Drink specials were domestic drafts ($3) and proseco ($6).\n\nOyster expert Erick is manning the oyster bar and he knows a lot about the oysters.  Chef JB (not BJ) can also be seen there getting his hands dirty with the oysters.  On our very last visit, we had a great time with other diners enjoying happy hour and the staff.  Good times! \n\nWhen the raw bar gets full, you can sit at the drink bar but it's just not the same.  I've tried their serious Bloody Mary's and it's a stiff drink that's filled with lots of goodness.\n\nOyster specials vary each day - I've been there for Watch House Point, VA oysters and James River, VA oysters.

Happy Hour is normally served at the raw bar or the alcohol bar from 3-6 daily. The main draw is the $1 fresh shucked oysters, but there are other treats as well. They have their other bites that are on their happy hour menu (which you can see online on their site, all various prices $6-9), 2 for 1 cocktail of the day, $3 draft beer, $6 prosecco. \n\nWhile I knew from signs it was at the bar, we were able to sit at a table. The BF and I chose Lagunitas IPA and Tenaya Creek Hefeweizen to drink since they were included in the $3 choices, which is nice as we only drink craft beers. \n\nWe started off with a dozen oysters which were Crystal Pointe and they were delicious. Lovely, fresh and creamy. We got another 8 and those ones were a different breed, I cannot remember the name but it was double the size and a bit more briny. I know it was a Ca one. Also very fresh and good, but I preferred the first kind. They give you migionette, cocktail and horseradish. They pick the oyster for the HH, but depending on availability I guess it changes. \n\nWe also got the cod bites which were really delicious. It was 3 small fish filets, but very fresh and fried to a crisp with a solid sauce. Also got a slider each which were good, but standard. They are a decent deal at $1.50 each though so I would get some to fill up if you're making a meal out of the happy hour. \n\nService was pretty good. We got a waiter who was all worried since he found out we were Yelpers and he was the new guy who just started, but he was good and attentive so nothing to worry there. What he didn't know, he went to go find out for us.\n\nWhile it was happy hour and a good deal considering the quality, it racked up fast!

I guess (3) service: it\'s okay at the bar - we had to get our bartender\'s attention quite a few times though (2.5) value: for the price we paid, you\'d do a lot better elsewhere (2.5)\n\nThe hubs and I had to schlep it down to Forum Shops because of a shopping errand for my mom. While we were at it, we decided to hit P.J. Clarke\'s for their happy hour. \n\nJust to preface, we don\'t indulge in oysters so if you\'re interested in the $1 oyster thing, this review might not apply to you. We ordered the buffalo chicken lettuce wraps ($7.90), crispy cod pieces ($9.50), a slider ($1.50), and the baked macaroni and cheese ($6.10).\n\nI\'d say definitely pass on the slider. Too little meat in the burger and of what was there, it was under seasoned. The bun, unfortunately, was hard and had an unpleasant texture. After one bite, we left the remaining bread alone.\n\nThe buffalo chicken lettuce wraps were odd. I guess if you are looking for a lighter alternative to buffalo chicken wings then perhaps this might appeal. However if you throw in the blue cheese dressing , it might be a wash. The buffalo chicken wraps were essentially diced up pieces of chicken breast - either grilled or sauteed - drenched in buffalo wing sauce and then served with lettuce and pickled cucumber and some carrot curls. Decidedly meh... if you\'re craving buffalo chicken wings, these are a poor substitute. The texture of the chicken was overly firm despite the dicing. Although the pickled cucumbers were okay, the whole plate needed more of the carrot and the addition of celery to cut through the heat. The blue cheese dressing was not overly "blue cheesy" and was solid.\n\nBaked macaroni and cheese with bacon and peas was okay. The cheese sauce was overly thick, gumming the pasta shells together to make an unpleasant texture. The flavor balance of the dish wasn\'t quite right either - there was a little too much bacon and not enough cheese. For the serving size and the cost, I\'d skip this one too.\n\nThe best thing was definitely the fried cod pieces. The batter was light and held well together with the fish. The tartar sauce was good but not spectacular - requiring perhaps a little more acidity to make it more interesting. That being said, you could probably get something like this at a much better price elsewhere.\n\nOf note, we did sit next a couple who ordered the chef\'s happy hour special of the day which were the ahi tuna tacos. I have to say, it was embarrassing. The tuna tacos were about the size of a taco made for a Smurf (FYI - smurfs are 3 apples tall). I think I could have fit all six tacos in the palm of my hand and consumed it in one bite. Although I did not try this item myself, given the portion size, I would highly recommend against ordering this. (Unless you are a high roller Smurf with money to burn in.)\n\nAll in all, this meal set us back about $30 which is expensive for happy hour specials. Although the food is indeed edible - probably between a level of 2.5 to a 3 star - the value for your money just isn\'t there. So overall, I\'d say 2.5 stars rounded down to a 2 when you factor in the cost. Avoid if you\'re not interested in oysters or drink specials. 2 starred review.', 'business_id': 'qpo6O2Ozbrn8wFnoCM4slA', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2013-02-21', 'type': 'review'}

The oysters we had were from BC, cant remember the name, they were okay. Not the best but nowhere near the worst oysters I've had. \nOverall this place is a solid 3 star place, while the $1 oysters are what drew us into this place the tab quickly got up to about $100 with a few drinks and a couple of $1.50 sliders and at that price you could get better oysters elsewhere. Still, I would have no problems coming back and would actually like to try the $99 dinner for 2 special they have here.", 'business_id': 'qpo6O2Ozbrn8wFnoCM4slA', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2013-03-16', 'type': 'review'}

EVERYDAY. \n\nReally, need I say more? \n\nI found this place with the help of fellow Yelpers planning UYEs (that I couldn't make -__- ). When I heard about these oyster prices I made sure to come by and check it out myself! It was probably the happiest day of me and Joshua B's life. We killed about 3 dozen our first trip.. hehehe. They have about 5 different types of oysters. I've practically tried all of them :X Not all in one trip though. For happy hour, you don't really get a choice of which one you'll be getting, it's just which one they'll serve. \n\nWe were lucky enough to try two different kinds our first visit. First the Skookum, WA and then Fanny Bay, BC. I was told by our shucker that Fanny Bay is in the top 5 for best oysters, but I honestly preferred the Skookum. Fanny Bay was just too large for my taste, I'm still somewhat of an oyster noob so I prefer them a little smaller. The sliminess of the oyster was just too overwhelming. My second visit consisted of Fanny Bay again, and Crystal Point. Crystal Point is definitely my favorite thus far. \n\nIf the oysters don't fill you up (they do no where close of for me..) you should try the sliders! $1.50 per slider and 2 is all you really need after your dozen oysters! They're honestly made to perfection. Last HH menu item i've tried is the fish tacos... don't even bother considering this plate (especially you fellas reading). When they presented it infront of me I thought it was a joke, like they were presenting a demo item of what was really coming out. There were 8 little tiny fish tacos lined up on this stretched out rectangular plate that looked like it could fit in Barbie's hands. I'm not even kidding, I wish I was. \n\nThe tacos were a major bust but that won't keep me from always returning here and inhaling those precious little oysters! You can't beat those prices! 4 out 5 stars only because I have yet to return and try their actual menu.", 'business_id': 'qpo6O2Ozbrn8wFnoCM4slA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2013-03-29', 'type': 'review'}

The service was very friendly, but not very able.  We were starving so quickly ordered salads and bread.  They said they would bring out the bread first, the bread, the bread, Bueller, Bueller, anyone?  It did not go down hill from here, nor did it get better, it was just consistently mediocre.  So they bring our the salad and we are still waiting for the bread and they come around to give us steak knives, then they walk around the table two times and then walk away without leaving us the knives.  We finish the salads, right as they bring out the bread.  They take away our plates, and we wait for the steaks.  We ordered a Ribeye, a Porterhouse and a filet.  The steaks come out, with no sides.  Oh, remember that question about steak knives and if the waiter should place them on the table...not only do we not have steak knives we have no flatware, the flatware left with the dirty salad plates, just as they should have, but was not replaced until we asked for it, well after the steaks arrived.  Oh, and the sides.... they eventually showed up.  So let's talk about the food.  My ribeye had fantastic flavor, though a little over done - I ordered medium rare and it turned up medium, and I was enjoying it for the first half, until I got closer to the bone when what was medium turned into medium well.  Now, please understand that steaks continue to cook after you remove them from heat, so if I would have been able to eat the steak when it came out, perhaps it would have been okay, but remember earlier when I said we had steaks but no flatware, that may have made all the difference in how done the steak was.  So, I just left the second half uneaten, paid our bill and left.  $200 bill for three steaks, salads and sides, but no alcohol.  One of the worst dining experiences I have had at that price point - ever, it was just skating on the edge the whole way, never bad enough to really complain, but just bad enough to make it not an enjoyable meal.\n\nNo reason it had to turn out this way, I hope management reads this and addresses the issues.", 'business_id': 'qpo6O2Ozbrn8wFnoCM4slA', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2013-06-11', 'type': 'review'}

I've heard of the place, seen it, but never had the opportunity until now. Let's start with the restaurant itself.  I thought that the actual restaurant is clean and loved the ambiance because it wasn't packed for a Holiday weekend.  The menu is just a basic one pager with food on one side and wines on the other.  The first thing to catch my eye with PJ Clarke's menu is the sticker price.  Here, you get your choices of different steaks, lobster, fish, burgers, and a few different appetizers.  The prices are a bit high, but expected since it's on the strip and in the Forum.  This is a chophouse and their steak and seafood entrees are about what you expect to pay for on the strip.  The portions looked just about right too.  My gripe about the prices is on their other food outisde of steaks.  Everything outside of their steaks were a bit over-priced.  I wasn't in the mood for steak on this visit, so I ended up with their Cadillac Burger (Over $20).  No frills, above average taste, but not worth the price tag in my opinion.  We had tater tots, calamari, and onion strings for appetizers and felt that all three were little on the salty side.  Terri R had the Lobster Mac and I thought it was pretty good, but a touch on the salty side too.  \n\nService here wasn't the best. From where we were at, you can hear the chef yelling at that the staff and our server wasn't the most attentive.  First, he took forever to take our order.  When our orders finally came in, he just dropped off the food without even asking if we needed anything else.  Yes sir, ketchup would be nice with our fries. Please, some dipping sauce for our onion strings would be great.  A knife would be perfect with my meal, but I guess a butter knife is all I get.  I also got an allergic reaction from my dessert (my fault).  All I needed to hinder my nauseousness was some crackers.  Our server was too busy chatting with his buds that I had to wave for another server to take care of us.  The sad part...our group was big and the tip was automatically added.  That means that our server got close to $100 for doing almost nothing. Overall, not the biggest fan of PJ's.\n\nAll is not lost though.  I still had a great time with friends and the birthday girl, Terri R.  Happy Birthday to my GP!!!  If I could rate the restaurant based on the great time we all had during dinner, it would be 5+ Stars for sure.  \n\nPS:  Read the reviews...seems like Happy Hour is the way to go here.  Maybe, I will be back.  But for now, 3 stars is all you get, PJ Clarke.", 'business_id': 'qpo6O2Ozbrn8wFnoCM4slA', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2013-07-07', 'type': 'review'}

Along with couple other friends/yelpers. Most part think it was all of our first time here so let the yelping begin. Lol! Honestly one of the first impressions got was had total New York vibe from first step walk into the restaurant too even the exterior design. I felt like I was going into basement or someplace dark for dinner because at times felt like needed more lighting just too read the menu. The whole service staff had the traditional white collar shirts, black tie, and black apron. Really style you see at high end steak house in New York. Too all the pictures hanging on the walls from different perspectives of the city, and the the white paper instead of tablecloth. Too daily specials written on different parts of the walls chalkboard style. If want be in New York State of mind this restaurant has the vibe.\n\nThe food since big party ordered few different apps so got too try the parmesan potatoes (sure not the exact name), and  calamari (one with hot peppers and one without). The parmesan potatoes were really good! I like the balance between the cheese and potatoes neither one dominated the other flavor wise. Nice crispy outside and hot moist inside! The presentation got give props for small cast iron skillet enough too fit six perfectly. The calamari enjoyed both of them. I enjoy spicy food so prefer the ones with the hot peppers. Spice level nothing but still like little extra something added too the depth of flavor. It nice size portion, golden crispy outside, and nice tartar sauce came as compliment dipping sauce. \n\nI had clam chowder too start meal. It was solid nothing too brag about but soup that order again in heart beat. My entree I ordered the fish and chips. I LOVED the batter that the fish was fried in. It was beer batter but also they used nice IPA beer. It had nice golden crispy slightly on the darker side thinking maybe the IPA just cheap beer. Yet it not heavy heavy batter still light and once break the crust the fish steaming hot and moist. The fish size in one monster piece. It covers the plate on top of bed of skinny fries. The shoe strings fries were nothing special. It lot of food. Bargain. \n\nMost people come here for HH. I noticed on the menu dollar oysters star of the show but other things on the HH menu too. If look at the regular menu prices the HH might be the best route too go. I could see myself coming back for HH.', 'business_id': 'qpo6O2Ozbrn8wFnoCM4slA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2013-07-07', 'type': 'review'}

The hamburger patty is a good size, thick enough for them to ask how you want the meat cooked. Most of the time my patty is cooked the way I asked, but my most recent I asked for medium rare and they gave me medium well/well done. It's alright no big deal. I also like the chicken sandwich, the portion of chicken they put on the bun is huge. They use brioche bread, which I absolutely love.

There were no fresh herbs, ONE piece of fennel and the feta was not tangy the way good feta should be.\nThe risotto was HORRIBLE! Never ever ever get this. They PRE COOK the risotto so when it comes out, it's like oatmeal. (i've had better mushy oatmeal, so I wasn't trying to be a hater to oatmeal). The first risotto they put out was so horrible we had to send back. The waiter said the chef was upset and was personally making the replacement. LESS than 5 minutes later, the waiter returns with it. UT OH! Risotto should NEVER come out in less than 5 minutes. If the chef personally prepared this dish, he needs to be fired. It was disgusting. It was SO mushy, I barely could eat it. HOWEVER, that said. The flavor of the dish was delicious. The wine and mushrooms were so yummy. But who the hell wants to eat mushy rice....unless of course, you ADVERTISE it as mushy rice. (It also wouldn't be $24). \nThe company I was with made the meal fantastic, but I wouldnt go back.

We had a party of 5 and since we have some meat eaters and wine fans, we opted to get there prefix meal, which is a 3 course meal and a bottle of wine for two people for $99.  Since there was 5 of us, we got 2 prefix meals and another entree.  What we ordered\n\nAppetizer\n-Field Greens Salad with Balsamic Vinaigrette-  very refreshing but a little heavy on the vinaigrette.  ask for it on the side\n\n-Classic New England Clam Chowder-  this is probably one of the best clam chowders ever!  They definitely do not skimp out on the clams!  Very rich, creamy, and chunky.  Delicious with oyster crackers!\n\nEntree\n-Colossal Sliced Prime Aged Porterhouse Steak (40oz)-  I am not that big of a steak fan but some steaks can be really tasty.  This steak was a little to dry for me, although it was still cooked medium rare, the cut of the meat was dry.\n\n-Broiled Aged Delmonico Steak (18oz) paired with Jumbo Lump Maryland Crab Cakes-  Wow, the delmonico steak could not have tasted better!  It was juicy, moist, and had some fatty parts (which i like).  Perfect balanced with the Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes! \n\nDessert\n-Warm Granny Smith Apple Cobbler-  This was good but nothing memorable\n\n-NY Style Cheesecake with Warm Berry Compote- I love cheesecake so this was a bonus for me!  The berry compote adds a different taste to a normal cheesecake.  The cheesecake itself is creamy and the crust was soft.\n\nSides\n-Grilled Jumbo Asparagus ($9.15)- nothing special.  just plain old asparagus.  could make it myself (get any other sides besides this....ridiculous price for veggies)\n\n-Crispy Onion Strings- YUM!!  I love anything fried and anything thin!!  These are super delicious and perfectly seasoned!  \n\nSince we ordered 2 prefix meals, we just opened one bottle of wine and they let us take the other one home.  The staff here seems very professional and well put together.  One server dropped their dishes right by us and the plates clattered and the first thing you notice is everyone gets to the scene and cleans up while others are asking us if we were okay, if we were hurt, and just showing concerns if there was anything they could do for us.  STRONG EFFORT in showing customer service to you guys!  I'd like to come back and try some other items as well.
