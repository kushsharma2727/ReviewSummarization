Went to go browse around and they have a nice selection of goods that are kinda hard to find to make Mediterranean food and in the back they have a cafe. Different canned goods, sauces, spices, bulk bins of beans, yogurts and cheeses, some fresh fruits and produce, lots of cookies and chocolate goodies. I then get to the ice cream and freak the fuck out. MASHTI MALONES ice cream. It's from Los Angeles and is a family owned shop that has exotic flavors: rose, lavender, rose saffron, mango, saffron pistachio, ginger rose, orange blossom.Yeah, it reminds me of happy happy times growing up on this stuff. I got a rose ice cream sandwich since they didnt have pints of anything but pistachio and faludeh. I also found my favorite white toblerones and other foreign goodies.\n\nCame in today after Slider Truck, and they had all sizes of the Creamy Rose so I got their biggest size, a quart and a small cup of Pistachio. We also got gummi bears. I know, why get these at a cultural market? The mood struck and they are super soft and make me happy as I type. I didn't need any cooking ingredients at the moment, but will come and expand some of my spices and sauces when I run out of what I have. \n\nI'm going to keep coming back though for Mashti Malones. It's one of my favorite treats ever. Thank you Zaytoon for carrying them!", 'business_id': 'rGvkljWlP7ysvLEUucoyqA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2010-05-08', 'type': 'review'}

So with the location programmed in my head, I drove to Zaytoon after my PT appointment for my late lunch.\n\nThe market is larger than I expected for an ethnic market located near Desert Breeze Park.  There are plenty of parking spaces in the strip mall where it is located, so buy as much as you want, because the walk to the car will be a short one.  The market has a decent size herbs & spices section, including Sumac, which I have recently heard about in my Mediterranean Cuisine class. They also carry fresh herbs in the refrigerator and they are in good condition and priced reasonably.  But I was mainly here to try the kabob and the Mashti Malone ice cream, which I didn\'t find on my own and had to ask about with the owner/cashier.\n\nAnyway, my primary objective is to try their kabob and I ordered their Koobideh Kabob entree ($8.99), which is Persian marinated ground beef, grilled on a sword-like skewer, and served with grilled tomato and Basmati (long grain) rice, and some raw onions.  The portion was good, and the Koobideh was juicy and pretty tasty. I would give it a 4 stars on the food. And 5 stars if they also serve fresh bread (like the one at Flame Kabob) too.\n\nService was good, but I was also the only in the "restaurant" at around 3:20pm, and the older gentleman and later the son(?) both came out on separate occasion to ask how the food was and if everything was okay, plus give me suggestion about the traditional way of eating the Basmati rice (which is to mix it with some of the soften butter and sprinkle with some Sumac).  So 4.5 stars there.\n\nI also asked about and was directed to their freezer right by the cashier and the door, where they keep all the Mashti Malone Persian Ice Creams.  I tried the Rosewater Saffron with Pistachios Ice Cream Sandwich last night, and wanted to try a different flavor today and went with the Creamy Rosewater Ice Cream ($2.99 for the smallest size container or 4 fl oz) so I can have it at the store.  I love the taste and fragrance of the rosewater, which is so different from the other more traditional ice cream flavors available everywhere else.\n\nThey also serve fresh squeezed juice at the juice bar, but I didn\'t see a menu for that.  Their ad states that they serve fresh juice (juiced per order) and have no additives, no added sugar and made from fresh not frozen ingredients.  Which makes this a hidden gem for juice lovers.\n\nWith Zaytoon being in my neighborhood, I will definitely be back for more ice cream, kabobs and sample their Juice Bar offerings.\n\nP.S.  They also offer cater services and will deliver within a limited delivery area for a 10% delivery charge and on minimum order of $50.', 'business_id': 'rGvkljWlP7ysvLEUucoyqA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2010-09-29', 'type': 'review'}

My sister and I stumbled upon Zaytoon during our summer trip to Vegas. We had been driving around aimlessly looking for something to eat and then BAM, came across this place. Actually, I don\'t remember how we found it. I just remember we wanted to get our grub on. We went in and perused the market area. I was hoping to find some cool knick-knacks or other rarities since I hardly ever go to Middle Eastern markets. I didn\'t find anything that I really wanted to get but my sister got a few food items. They carry some flip flops and some evil eye looking jewelry but I\'m pretty particular about what brand of flip flops I wear and definitely am not into evil eye jewelry. \n\nI decided to go to the restaurant next door, which isn\'t really next door since it\'s only partitioned by a screen or something. I ordered two beef sandwiches a.k.a. Koobideh Kabobs wrapped in lavash bread, which cost $7.99 each. You have the option of choosing a Shirazi Salad or french fries so I got the salad for myself and the fries for my stepdad. My sister decided not to get something from here but went to Long John Silvers instead and she regrets that choice to this day. Hahahah. \n\nAnyway, the food was sooo good that when I came back to Vegas last week I found myself craving it and wanting it. We finally came to Zaytoon on our last day here to have a proper lunch before setting out for L.A. It was just as good as I remembered and the Masto Khiar (cucumber and yogurt) was so creamy and thick. A lot of the other ones I\'ve had before were just plain runny and blah. I ordered the same thing again since I wanted to take half my sandwich for the road and it\'s a lot easier to eat a sandwich in the car than a box of basmati rice! It\'s a shame I didn\'t get a dessert but I got a yummy mint flavored yogurt soda. I couldn\'t really taste the mint and the uncarbonated version definitely tastes much more minty, but it\'s all good. My sisters also really enjoyed what they ordered. One of them ordered the same thing I got but with avocado slices and the other one got the Chicken Kabob plate. \n\nThe service was also great. There was just one person working at the time we got here. He was youngish and very attentive. He was also very cordial and polite. He showed me how to mix the yogurt soda and how to open it since there\'s a trick to opening it. If you don\'t open it properly, which equates to opening it very slowly then you may end up with it all over your shirt.\n\nZaytoon is one place that I look forward to going back to the next time I\'m in Vegas. Perhaps, I\'ll go back multiple times if time and my funds permit just to try other stuff. It\'s affordable, convenient, and the food is just plain good. Now if only I could find a place reminiscent of it back home.', 'business_id': 'rGvkljWlP7ysvLEUucoyqA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2011-01-01', 'type': 'review'}

It was served with DELICIOUS fresh flat bread sprinkled with sesame seeds.\n\nFor my entree I got the Zereshk polo with barberry rice which was grilled chicken served with basmatti rice sprinkled with saffron and barberries. I had never had barberries before. They were sweet and tart and reminded me of somewhere between a currant and a lingonberry. The chicken was nicely seasoned and moist.\n\nMy wife got the Shish kabob which was skewered pieces of fillet and vegetables. It was nicely seasoned and was served with a grilled tomato and basmatti rice sprinkled with saffron.\n\nFor dessert we split the ice cream and carrot juice dish. It consisted of  cubes of saffron ice cream served in a glass of fresh carrot juice. The ice cream has rose water and pistachios mixed into it. I'm not a big fan of rose water. However, the ice cream was still pretty good. The carrot juice was delicious and refreshing. The dish was reminiscent of a root beer float. I liked it a lot and would definitely order it again.\n\nI liked Zaytoon quite a bit and plan to go back.", 'business_id': 'rGvkljWlP7ysvLEUucoyqA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2011-03-12', 'type': 'review'}

I know, I know, there's an app for that, but sometimes I throw caution to the wind and just go for it.\n\nI called them up for a take out order and decided on the Regular Chicken Kabob Entree and an iced tea.  I must mention that from taking my order over the phone to doing the cashier work, the gentleman who helped me was extremely friendly.  After my long drive back to the office and opening the food, I was extremely disappointed to not see any bread.  Upon looking back at the menu, I realized that it was not something which came with the entree, but rather a side that needed to be ordered.  After bashing my head against the desk for about 5 minutes due to this error, I began eating what I did have, which were some nicely cooked pieces of chicken (though not very much of it) over a HEAP of basmati rice.  On the side were several chopped up onions, and an unappetizing looking charred tomato and pepper.  I'm generally not a fan of these items from any mediterranean joint, so not docking them for that, maybe it's just me.  The chicken tasted fine, but didnt really separate itself from other places I've had the same dish.   I think I would have preferred some more char on the chicken instead of on the veggies, but it did end up very juicy which I must say was nice.   The rice tasted average to me, though I did appreciate the amount they gave.  I can't help but think that had I ordered some bread on the side (though I'd prefer it just came with some) that I might have enjoyed the whole thing more.  I definitely know for next time.\n\nFor the lack of bread with the entree, and the fact that there wasn't too much chicken in my meal, I can't say that I thought it was that great of a value.  Zaytoon definitely requires some more investigating to me, and I'll also note that my friend that I brought with me got a falafel sandwich with fries and his fries smelled and looked heavenly.  He polished them off during the drive back to work and I didnt get to try myself.   I have to wrap this review up, the picture of the fresh bread that I can see below where I type now is pissing me off.

The waiter and waitress were extremely friendly and sweet.  We started with their baba ghanoush that was so good I got an extra order to go home.  It came with a great fresh baked flatbread.  For entrees we got their "bone in chicken kabob" which was actually a whole cornish game hen cut into pieces, marinated and grill.  Super moist and flavorful.  It came with rice, an onion salad and a blistered tomato.  We also got their special which was a lamb shank and might have been one of the best lamb shanks we have ever had.  Delicious.  We walked out very happy.\n\nAlso they have fresh juices that they juice to order.  I got the watermelon and the boy got carrot and beet together.  Both were delicious and refreshing.

(4) service: the owners are super friendly and food is served promptly (5),overall - it's rare to find a joint where you want to return to explore the different dishes of a culture. Zaytoon is one of those places (4.5).\n\nI was craving hummus with some pita one day and the hubs found this place on Yelp. After that fateful night - we've been back at least 3x within the last week -- yes, it is that good.\n\nThe key dishes here IMHO are the appys (priced at $3.99 each). Our by far favs are the masto khiar (yogurt and cucumber) and the masto musir (shallot with yogurt). The yogurt itself is so thick and luscious, I bet you could turn the bowl over and not a dollop would escape. Yes it is that decadent. Paired with endless piping hot sesame topped Iranian flatbread (FYI -the owners keep the bread coming) - oh so crispy, flaky - it is definitely addicting. We've tried both the hummus and the kashe bademjaan (roasted eggplant dip) too which are both very good as well. \n\nI've tried their falafel and veggie sandwiches with both optional sides of the shiraz salad and fries. The sandwiches are loaded with onions, tomatoes, green peppers and cucumbers with a ?yogurt sauce and is oh so delicious. The falafel is crispy on the outside while retaining its fluffy interior. Completely satisfying.\n\nThe shiraz salad was nicely acidic to accompany the richness of the other items. Dressed with mint and citrus, the flavours of the onion, cucumber, tomato mixture really pop. The fries are okay and the portions are generous.\n\nMy hubby loves to get their chicken soltani. Both the chicken and koobedeh kabobs are well seasoned and moist. The plate comes with a roasted tomato, onions served with a bed of basmati rice. The butter and sumac on the table are used to dress the rice. \n\nWe tried their pistachio ice cream flavoured with rosewater and saffron. Nicely floral with some cardamom mixed it, it was a nice way to finish a meal and cleanse the palate.\n\nEvery time we go there, I'm always looking around and try to see what other people are getting so we can try it next time. We saw another gentleman who ordered the koobideh kabob with fresh herbs and on fresh bread (aka KGB) which looked intriguing and has been put on our list to try the next time we are there. Not to mention there was an interesting stew they were offering over a different type of rice. The spinach soup and lamb shank sounded wonderful too.\n\nA key factor to why we keep coming back is the service. The owners of the restaurant are really obliging and willing to take the time to explain the different dishes they offer. I was a little bit curious about their torshi - it's some form of Persian pickled vegetables. The owner actually brought some out for me to try and warned me it was an acquired taste (it was actually very good - a little bit sweet, nicely spiced --- however the hubs didn't care for it). It's really cool that they would do that.\n\nOverall, this a great little neighbourhood joint that serves some delicious, intriguing eats for reasonable prices. Throw in the friendly service,  you have a hidden gem - not to be missed! 4.5 stars out of 5.", 'business_id': 'rGvkljWlP7ysvLEUucoyqA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2012-09-23', 'type': 'review'}

The beef was excellent.  The juices soaked the bread that covered the entire plate.  I got an iced tea with my dinner.\n\nService was excellent.  An older man waited on me originally and then was replaced by a younger man--the owner, I believe.  Iced tea was refilled twice with no need to ask for a refill.  The server checked back to make sure everything was OK.\n\nSince I'm such a babe in the woods with this cuisine, I asked the owner if there was a correct way to eat the food.  He said what I had done was exactly the way he does it.  Let the juices soak the bread and enjoy all the richness of the dish.\n\nI left without checking out the store section.

It was all served with rice, grilled tomato and onion. I wished I had saved some of the bread/dip to make a sandwich out of it all- it was delicious!\n\nWe had to get some Persian ice cream for dessert because I've been obsessed ever since I tried it at Saffron and Rose in LA and Lavash in San Francisco.

The hummus was rich and creamy, the baba ganoush was garlicky, creamy, and tasty, the dolma were warm and fresh. Wow. I think we ordered half the appetizers. The falafel were hot, crunchy, and so savory. What really wowed me was the chicken kabob and the steak "kabob" (I do not remember the exact name, it was less of a kabob and more of a strip of thin steak on a skewer). They were both so flavorful, juicy, and fresh. I am getting hungry just remembering it.

On my first visit here, the service was sort of spotty. On the second visit, they were much much friendlier, and maybe this comes from them treating you more like a regular once they know you're not just a one time visit.\n\nThe fresh warm lavash they serve here is dotted with sesame seeds and blistered just a little bit. They'll bring you an unending amount of this bread until you say Uncle!  It seems to be made to order, and is perfect for dipping in their bracing hummus, enlivened from the addition of lemon juice. I find most hummus seems to lean towards lemon, or tahini. Theirs is lemony. Oh, and endless lavash. The server was kind of enough to make many recommendations and answer any question without missing a beat. Did I mention endless lavash?\n\nSo far here I've had their chicken kabob wrap with house salad. The chicken was cooked perfectly, and seasoned well. The fresh tomatoes in there just added to brightness of the wrap, and it was big enough that I took half of it home. The salad is a mix of tomatoes, cucumbers and onions that have been diced and tossed with some parsley, mint, lemon and olive oil.\n\nThe koobideh is seasoned ground beef kabob, which is very traditional, and amazing! Very tender, perfectly seasoned, a lot of interesting flavors. All of the kabobs come with steamed rice and a charred tomato. Love me some charred tomato!", 'business_id': 'rGvkljWlP7ysvLEUucoyqA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2013-04-25', 'type': 'review'}

After being given a cup of water, i had placed my order with him. \n\nI had ordered the "Koobideh Kabob" which was two skewers of their marinated ground beef, grilled on a skewer, served with a grilled tomato and basmati rice. \n\nVery popular and widely eaten Persian dish. \n\nPrior to the entree arriving, they serve a nice warm freshly made "bread" (or flatbread), i believe its called Barbabi bread, with white and black sesame, and a side of butter. Delicious on its own. \n\nFor starters, those who are not familiar with basmati rice, its a variety of long grain rice that\'s very popular in the Eastern Mediterranean and Middle-East countries. \n\nKoobideh kabab is an iranian minced meat kabab made with either ground lamb, beef, or chicken with a variety of spices as well as parsley and chopped onions. After seasoning and marinating for a few hours, the meat is squeezed on a skewer to be cooked over a coal grill or in a clay oven (more traditional style). \n\nServed nice and hot. Perfect bite sizes if you cut it where it "dips" (refer to picture), The Koobideh kabab is super moist and flavorful. Any residual sauce that may come from the kabab will be easily absorbed by the basmati rice. The rice is nice and fluffy. Add a little butter to it when its nice and hot, and it becomes delicious ! \n\nThe grilled tomato adds a nice, refreshing touch to it all. Just an ordinary grilled tomato but it just brightens up everything if you slice off a piece and eat it during the meal. \n\nOverall, great experience as usual. As said before, its a family owned restaurant, so super nice service. Since I came alone this time, i had my kindle with me and was reading it during my meal.

But after visiting here at least once a week for the past month I'm addicted to the koobideh kabob ($9.99) -- two skewers of ground beef marinated in a wonderful blend of spices. I've tried other items but keep going back to my first love -- the koobideh. The chicken kabobs ($9.99) are well seasoned and usually enough food for two meals. If you want to try both, get the chicken soltani ($12.99)  which has one skewer each of the chicken and koobideh. The filet in the Barg kabob ($16.99) was decent, but a little tough. For apps, the falafels ($3.99) and hummus ($3.99) are as good as you'll find anywhere in town.", 'business_id': 'rGvkljWlP7ysvLEUucoyqA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2014-03-07', 'type': 'review'}

I'm used to having it served with soft pita bread but I also enjoyed what Zaytoon served which was like a huge cracker.\n\nI also tried the dolma which had lttle pieces of pomegranate sprinkled on the top. It was served warm which is a plus for me. I was hoping it would be cooked with tomato sauce. That is how I'm used to eating them since childhood but everywhere I have tried never serves it that way. I guess cooking them in tomato paste isn't the norm.\n\nMy main entree was a special cut of Iranian fillet mignon served with basamanti rice. The meat was nice and tender. The rice also had a pleasant taste to it.

Their cucumber salad is very sour and tangy, you must pair it with bread. Their bread is a thin crisp bread with sesame seeds. The grape leaves were decent. The eggplant with beef casserole was amazing, it\'s a very stew-like flavorful dish perfect over basmati rice. I ordered a side of fresh yoghurt to compliment the flavors.

Somewhere between 5 and 10 tables, and authentic in that wonderful, unpretentious way that announces their food is good, and they live here, so sit down and eat. The food is very good; we had a group, and 3 of us had the kofta, one of us had lamb. Everything was good, but not slap-yo-momma I have to order something else. The kofta started to dry out towards the end, and I sort of felt that overall, most things could use a little seasoning and salt - BUT everything came with a lovely packet of Sumac salt. It needs that. That makes everything much more lovely. Also, we licked the bottom of the Babaganoush. \n\nOHH!!! OH! And the Market! They have sweet lemons!!!! What, Foolish American who shops only at smiths? "Lemons are never sweet?" you say? Ah, fool that you are, you have not shopped at ethnic markets and bought things you do not know the name of. Sweet lemons are sort of like the beautiful godly love child of meyer lemons and tangerines. They are soft, and about the size of a small valencia orange. They are yellow and speckly, and sweet with a sharp tang on the finish. They make margaritas superlative. They are also awesome peeled into mandarin-esque wedges and eaten as snackies. Zaytoon HAS THEM. And about 10 other wonderful citrus and fruits you won\'t find at albertsons, for prices you won\'t find at albertsons, fresher than you will find at alberstons.

I have been here many times and always had great quality food. I am a big fan of Persian food in general and was so happy to find this place. It is about 15 minutes away from the crazy strip area so it was great for me because I was able to check out a different side of Vegas and more of a local area. Anyways the food always came very well made and the portions were generous. Definitely will be a returning customer next time I am on Vegas.', 'business_id': 'rGvkljWlP7ysvLEUucoyqA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2015-10-19', 'type': 'review'}

All the items are made with care, are fresh and served personally by the owners.

The atmosphere is quaint and charming. The family that runs the restaurant is personable and remarkably attentive. Their bread served with the mast o khiar is sensational. The meat (beef and chicken) is flavorful and served with an ample amount of delicious rice.

I love Mediterranean food and this place is very close to where we live. I've been to quite a few Mediterranean restaurants in town but this one ia definitely near the top of the list as a favorite. Everything I've had is so good, fresh, perfectly seasoned. My favorites are the shirazi salad, the dolmas, and pretty much any of the lamb dishes are fantastic. The iced tea is even amazingly different than any I've had in my life! Of course we end the meal with Baklava and today we had the pistachio ice cream with saffron and rose water, what a treat!\n\nOnly complaint is that they tend to get very busy and the restaurant only has 6 tables, so it fills up quickly. There is an attached market that we have yet to shop at, but is also pretty busy. \n\nDefinitely recommend this place for lunch! Just arrive before noon :)", 'business_id': 'rGvkljWlP7ysvLEUucoyqA', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2015-12-22', 'type': 'review'}
