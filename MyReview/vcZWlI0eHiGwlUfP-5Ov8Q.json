I heard the place was small but man its like a glorified walk in closet.  There were 5 tables of 4 and one table of 3.    The wait wasnt very long but the servers werent  very happy i was by myself.   i found it humorous that i was being discriminating against because of my numerology.  I was even asked if i would prefer take out, i declined of course.  Than, after being seated at a table for four I was asked to switch to a table of three (in mid meal mind you) to accomodate the party of four coming in.   I laughed through the entire ordeal and really didnt blame them.  Like they say in golf "The ONESOME has no power."\n\nOk enough about me and onto the food.  I started off with a fresh shrimp roll.   It came as advertised, fresh, crunchy and sweet.  For a main course i ordered the pumpkin curry with chicken.  I have never ordered this before so i do not have anything to compare it too.  it came in bowl filled with chicken and pumpkin chunks.  A plate of rice was also served.  It must be ignorance but it always seems like thai places never serve enough rice to go with the curries.  The curry was delicious and the broth had a mild pumpkin flavor but when you included the pumpkin in your bite it had the perfect flavor.   \n\nIt was an entertaining but more importantly a delicious meal and I would definitely go back especially in the spring because they do have two tables for outdoor seating.', 'business_id': 'vcZWlI0eHiGwlUfP-5Ov8Q', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2009-10-13', 'type': 'review'}

However, the consensus around the table was that the curry dishes were not as good as those at Green Mango - they seemed a little on the watery side.  Perhaps not enough coconut milk (some of them specifically that they are not made with coconut milk, so there\'s that).  Mainly, they just didn\'t seem as... "taste"y as others we\'d had before.  Also, the pumpkin was a touch undercooked and was tough.\n\nBut we loved the fresh mango with sweet sticky rice dessert, perhaps even more than the fried banana dessert with ice cream.

Also, it\'s practically in my back yard and I\'m always up for some Thai food.\n\nThe problem with most Thai restaurants is that nothing really sets them apart. If you were blindfolded and a number of Pittsburgh Thai restaurants set down plates of the same dish you\'d probably have a very hard time picking them apart. Luckily, The Smiling Banana Leaf managed to carve itself a niche in the Thai-saturated streets of Pittsburgh.\n\nJust by looking at the bustle inside the restaurants shows you how good the place is. There\'s only five tables inside yet they are always filled with happy, hungry people. Customers are constantly coming in and out for take-out and the smells coming from the kitchen are amazing. The restaurant is intimate without being intimidating.\nThe server we had was great. She was very upbeat and made small talk with us. She kept our waters filled and was attentive even though she was responsible for all five tables and a lot of the take-out ordering. Her warm demeanor alone makes The Smiling Banana Leaf the kind of restaurant you want to come back to.\n\nThe food was excellent, by the way. To start we branched out from our usual and got "Tofu Paradise". The tofu was crispy on the outside and soft, warm and flavorful on the inside. The peanut sauce, something I usually do not care for, was smooth and perfectly balanced between sweet and savory. It went well with the veggies that were cooked but still crispy.\n\nThe Tom Yum soup was served in a heaping bowl and had a brilliant red color to it. The pieces of chicken were hearty and the lemon grass was delicious. It wasn\'t my favorite, though. I like the soup to be really sour and this was more sweet tasting. To each his own, though! It was still prepared expertly. The fact that their dishes vary in flavor to other restaurants means to me that the chef is taking great care in cooking his food. It\'s like all cooking, depending on the tastes of the cook certain flavors may be emphasized or downplayed.\n\nI ordered the Spicy Green Bean entree and thought it was delicious. The sauce was spicy and tangy but also had some curry notes to it. Occasionally the spiciness would subside and you\'d get smooth hints of coconut. Usually I\'m not a fan of Thai sauces but I found myself sopping it up with my chicken and veggies.\n\nFor dessert we had the epitomical Thai dessert, Thai custard and sticky rice. The portions were perfect for two people and much more generous than I usually get. The bill at the end of the meal was very fair and surprisingly cheap.\n\nThe Smiling Banana Leaf is my new favorite Thai Place. It absolutely oozes charm.', 'business_id': 'vcZWlI0eHiGwlUfP-5Ov8Q', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2011-02-16', 'type': 'review'}

Well worth the search in Highland Park to find it!\n\nWe went last night with friends who are vegetarian and so we had a variety of dishes at our table.

The sauce was a little different - it was a soy based that almost tasted sweet and sour - it was quite tasty.  We weren\'t sure what "temp" to order things not having been there before  - I ordered a 5 but would probably move up to a 6 next time as they are on par with the usual Thai restaurant we go to.  It was the best kind of heat - you could taste it but it didn\'t build or last long, so you could taste all the flavors coming through.  My preference is always heat but not overpowering heat.  DH ordered his favorite green curry and gave it two thumbs up - while I didn\'t taste it, the smell was just heavenly (it was so good, he wasn\'t offering to share :(.  The other couple ordered the Choo Curry Tofu which was a basic red curry with tofu and the Tofu eggplant with basil which was loaded with both tofu and what looked like the smaller Asian eggplant.\n\nThe restaurant is quite tiny - perhaps they can seat 20 there.  We arrived on a cold snowy Sunday evening at 630 without a reservation (we bad).  They suggested that we walk up the street to the coffee shop and they would call us as soon as a table was ready.\n\nDefinitely worth the trip - just call first!', 'business_id': 'vcZWlI0eHiGwlUfP-5Ov8Q', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2011-02-21', 'type': 'review'}

I went to look for my Bangkok Balcony review, and realized that I had never written one.  Well....at least now you know how many stars Bangkok Balcony gets before I write a review!\n\nI had tried to visit this place once before today, but when I called in to try to reserve a table for 5 at 7PM two hours before, they were booked until 930PM with no space even for walkins.  So, yes. MAKE A RESERVATION.  I made one more than a day in advance for 2 at 7:15PM on a thursday evening.  Parking was pretty easy; I found a number of free street side spots along Euclid Ave, north of Bryant St.  \n\nThe very first thing I noticed before I visited the restaurant was their marked difference in price.  For the same dishes, Smiling Banana Leaf had at least a 2-3 dollar price advantage on almost all the main dishes compared to those at Bangkok Balcony.  The only two things that were to be determined at dinnertime were quality and quantity.\n\nWe ordered and split a Som Tum (papaya salad) spiciness level 5, Red Curry with chicken spiciness level 5, and basil pork spiciness level 5.  The red curry was delicious: not too rich like some places make them (with regular coconut milk instead of low fat coconut milk), and just the right quantity. the papaya salad was actually perched upon a bed of greens, a change from the usual way I have it (without the bed of greens, obviously).  there was a tad bit too much dressing, which I will take a note of next time i order the dish, which was otherwise tasty.  lastly, the pork of the basil pork was slightly tough. the pork didn't seem very fresh or something, perhaps due to the fact that most people order chicken.  not sure though: i wouldn't deter anyone from trying it!\n\nCutting this review short, someone in my vicinity is complaining that i'm writing a novel. so...good thai iced tea! potent tea flavor without too much of that condensed milk mixed in (usually the point of failure in man other establishments).

It's low lit, but not irritatingly so, and the only real complaint I have is that the tables are a bit close together due to it's small size, making it ideal for a fun night out with friends as opposed to a private and quiet gathering.  And given the limited seating you'll definitely want reservations.\n\nWe started out with the fresh rolls, the best I've ever had, and followed up with entrees of pad thai, pineapple chicken fried rice, cashew pork and pumpkin chicken curry.  The presentation was beautiful but it should be noted that the entrees come as individual servings, not necessarily for sharing as is common to some Thai restaurants, so it's a good idea to order perhaps one or two more things on the menu if you plan to share amongst yourselves, as we did.  The pad thai was not at all greasy, a first for me, and all ingredients used were fresh and high quality.  Surprisingly, my very favorite was the pineapple fried rice.  I'm not sure what spices were used but it was phenomenal and unique.  \n\nMy conclusion is that you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  I'll definitely be a repeat customer and can't wait to try out more of their exceptional food.", 'business_id': 'vcZWlI0eHiGwlUfP-5Ov8Q', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2011-03-22', 'type': 'review'}

The spicy green beans with chicken is my favorite dish (level 8). Yesterday, I tried it with pork and it was an epic fail! The pork was really chewy. I like my meat (except for bacon) very well done. The first time my husband and I ate there we actually dined in which was a big mistake! My friend told me it was intimate but she should have told me it was a crack in the wall (not a hole but a tiny crack). There was only one waitress/hostess for the WHOLE restaurant! Be prepared to be thirsty because it might take a while to get a refill. The seats are very uncomfortable! I felt like I was back in high school sitting on the bleachers with a numb butt. The waitress was nice but she didn't know BASIC restaurant etiquette. I asked for a straw and chopsticks and she gave me both of them unwrapped with her hands all over it! Gross!

The pineapple fried rice was a bit on the sweet side, but if you like it, it may be for you.

My friend easily ate 2 bowls of rice for the amount of curry they gave.  It was very, very good.  I'm not sure if I like the bamboo in it though.  It was kind of over cooked (probably because it was canned bamboo or something), and the peas and carrots made it seem like they used some frozen vegetable blend, which didn't go well with the curry.

The spring roll was quite good, steamed dumplings were very light and well seasoned and the calamari was good, but a bit overcooked. It was a little too chewy because of it, but it wasn\'t a bit greasy and the coating was perfect. However, the dipping sauce was extremely sweet and almost like jam. I preferred the dumpling dipping sauce for it. \n\nThe glass noodle salad was heavily, heavily dressed with a dressing that would have benefitted from  healthy does of acid and much less sweetness. However, the meat in the salad was generous and the shrimp in the salad was well cooked. The vegetables, specifically the onions, were rather huge pieces, while there seemed to be an under representation in the "greens" department. Honestly, by the time I finished my salad I couldn\'t really taste a whole lot because it was just SO sweet. \n\nThe pad thai, at a 7 level hotness, wasn\'t very hot. And again, it was pretty sweet. There weren\'t very many bean sprouts and the meat chunks were huge. The curried noodles, at a hotness of 5, had a delicious sauce, but the noodles were pretty overcooked. \n\nIt could be, we caught the restaurant on a off day, as it was a holiday weekend.

On the inside they have a handful of cramped tables, and (not?) surprisingly the outdoor area on the sidewalk is just as crammed, as our group of three attempted to sit at a small bistro table for two. The day was wonderful and I called ahead to ask if they would mind my dog joining us, and they said it would be fine.\n\nThe waitress is extremely friendly when we come, but she is usually falling over herself when there is a rush as it is usually only her to manage the tables and a girl at the front to manage the take-out service. We ordered some dumplings, red noodle curry(6 spicy, $11), mango tilapia(8 spicy, $13, and pad ped telay(6 spicy, $13). We also got a steamed dumpling appetizer($5) and a thai iced tea($2) while we waited. When the waitress brought out the dumplings, she also brought along a to-go container with water for my dog.\n\nThe dumplings were decent, but the sauce that came with them, a sour, sweet sauce with a hint of soy and lemongrass was delicious, I could have poured it on everything. Our food came out quickly, the red curry was a humongous portion, a large bowl filled with vegetables and noodles and up to the brim with a delicious curry sauce. It was decently spicy for a 6. The mango tilapia was quite sweet, and extremely tasty. Well fried and not overcooked, the only complaint about the dish was that for being the highest spicy level of the group, it was the mildest(aka a 0 on a 1-10 scale).  The pad ped telay was my favorite, great flavor and a lot of spice. I was stealing a bit of that dish by the end of the meal. We also got a fried banana, which comes with ice cream and a delicious caramel cinnamon sauce, and three small fried spring rolls full of banana.\n\nSmiling banana leaf has some of our favorite Thai in the city and its well worth the trip up, just be aware that the place is small and there is often a wait. If you live in the area, take-out might be just as good of an option.", 'business_id': 'vcZWlI0eHiGwlUfP-5Ov8Q', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2011-08-27', 'type': 'review'}

I don't think it would kill them to hire an additional waitress.\n\nSo despite this pretty major gripe, Smiling Banana Leaf still gets a 3 because the food was quite good, and inexpensive to boot.

Every time that I\'ve gone, we\'ve had reservations or picked up take out, but you still end up standing for a few minutes, packed uncomfortably in the opening of the restaurant or standing outside, while your table is prepared. Once at your table, you still feel the almost-claustrophobic size of the restaurant, but it\'s easy to adjust to due to the brighter lighting that takes the setting from a potentially intimate dinner to a more casual one.\n\nMost of the hesitations go out the door, though, once you get your food. The food is excellent, and incredibly affordable. Your portions aren\'t likely to be as large as some other Thai restaurants in the city, but the price is perfect, and really, so are the portions...unless you\'re looking for a gluttonous evening.\n\nThe curries are tasty and the pad thai is my favorite in the city. My favorite Thai dish right now is actually the pad kee mow/spicy noodle from the Banana Leaf. Their wide rice noodles create a different texture than other similar dishes that I\'ve had, and really sets it apart.\n\nI\'d say definitely make a reservation if you\'re going to dine in, as there are only about 8 or so tables. Otherwise, grab take out, because it\'s definitely one of the best Thai spots in Pittsburgh!', 'business_id': 'vcZWlI0eHiGwlUfP-5Ov8Q', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2012-02-27', 'type': 'review'}

My dining companion also commented that she really enjoyed the Pad Thai.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely eat here again.

I prefer the former, I get a little claustrophobic sitting that close to complete strangers. \n\nWe are fortunate, us Pix\'burgers to have a nice selection of Thai restaurants in the area. That being said this is the uncontested winner in my book. The servers are great, friendly, welcoming- it seems everyone enjoys working there. That is an excellent framework for any successful business. The parking can be rough, it is on Bryant Street. Any given weekend can make this messy. Best to use the buddy system. I call ahead for take-out, me husband drives a few laps around if his double parked car becomes an issue... I run in and grab the goods.\n\nI ordered the Moo Yang for our starter. Grilled and mouth-watering, slightly smoky and sweetly marinated pork served on a bed of lovely greens. A nice pile of sticky rice to boot. Did I mention the dipping sauce? Not that the pork needs it, but seriously what is in this spicy plum sauce? I want to ask for extra next time and eat it with a spoon. Then again I am obsessed with dips, sauces and the like. If you are not- you are missing out! Nevertheless, the pork can stand on its own.\n\nSoup. Oh dear. I am quite the sucker for coconut based broths. Let me tell you that the Tom Kha Soup is a pure creamy decadence of nirvana. I cannot say enough good things about this soup in general and especially their preparation of it. They obviously use a decent coconut milk. I honestly can say I can tell the difference. Moreover, the ginger or should I say the galangal the "kha" of the soup brings that sweet and zesty twist that complements the coconut milk fondly. A bit of mushroom, a hint of lemongrass, a splash of lime juice, and a dash of red chili paste (methinks) merry well together especially when one chooses to add the shrimp. I think non-shrimp eaters would like that one can add chicken, beef or tofu. But the shrimp, juicy medium sized scrimps! Love it.\n\nI have a confession to make...I am that Thai-food customer...but it is okay- I can admit it...I love Shrimp Pad Thai. I order it every time I eat Thai food. \n\nI know, I know. I cannot believe I am writing this in a such a public forum. I feel like I need to attend some sort of addiction group. "Hi, my name is Jordana and I cannot resist ordering the same Thai entree every time we go out for Thai." Nothing is more run-of-the-mill than Shrimp Pad Thai.

After driving out to Pusadee's Garden and discovering it was closed, we did a quick Yelp search for the next closest place...and ended up at Smiling Banana Leaf.\n\nAfter a short 15-20 minute wait, we were seated at a table in the tiny dining room.  Not a bad wait, considering we didn't have a reservation.  I ordered tom yum soup and green curry with tofu and couldn't have been happier with my selections.  They will ask you on a scale of 1-10 how spicy you want your food, and they aren't afraid to really add some heat.  The portions are large, the food is flavorful and spicy, and everything came out quickly.  My boyfriend, who ordered the tom kha soup and panang curry, was equally as happy.  We left Smiling Banana Leaf full, happy, and with leftovers that tasted even better the next day.\n\nAfter our dinner at Smiling Banana Leaf, I craved that green curry all week long.  I even went so far as to attempt to make my own green curry.  And I've never made any sort of curry in my life.  Needless to say, I think I'll leave it to the chefs at Smiling Banana Leaf.\n\nWe decided to make our second trip to the restaurant less than a week later.  We rarely eat at the same place twice, especially so soon after our first visit.  But we had to make an exception for this place.  This time, we planned ahead by making reservations and bringing a bottle of wine.  I decided to switch it up and try the tofu eggplant with basil, which was tasty but came out a bit cold.  My boyfriend again went with the panang curry, and enjoyed it just as much the second time.  Next time, I will probably switch back to a curry as well.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend Smiling Banana Leaf.   The service is always super speedy and friendly, the food is delicious, and the value is great.  Considering how small the dining room is (probably seats about 25 people), I would suggest making a reservation.  It can also get quite loud when the dining room is full.  Keep in mind that the restaurant is also BYOB.

After having a brief discussion with the...absent server, I managed to get my calamari out to the table.  The calamari was great as always.  Not overly breaded, great soft texture, and the sweet chili sauce was a much better option than the typical marinara.\n\nThe curry took a little long getting out, but made up for it as I took the first bite.  The rice was a colorful blend of different grain rices, and there was a generous portion of curry.  The flavor was great, and it was almost as spicy as I would have wanted it.  Home run.\n\nNow for the reason that put it short of five stars.  The service.  The server, who had some sort of European accent, was friendly, but seemed to be overwhelmed, which as a member of the service industry, I couldn't believe.  There was 3 tables other than myself in there, and he seemed pretty weeded.  My calamari came up after my curry, but he was apologetic, and get them out in a timely fashion, and kept my food hot in the back while me and my coworker ate our appetizer.  My water glass was empty within 5 minutes of sitting down, and remained empty until I was halfway finished with my meal, which was the only thing that really bothered me about my meal.\n\nAll in all, regardless of the service, I would go to Smiling banana leaf whenever I'm craving Thai food.

It probably was just a mistake or I'm becoming more sensitized to spice, but either way - the food was amazing. \n\nTo start we had the samosas which had a bit of a twist on them! They had cucumber sauce and the dough was more similar to the wraps that spring rolls are made of.  It was interesting, but a little too sweet for my taste. I was looking for a more savory samosa. We had the pad thai and the panang curry which were good. However, the portions were pretty small and the prices were a bit high for how much food they were offering.

While Smiling Banana Leaf isn't my favorite as far as noodle dishes (Thai Cuisine and it's Spicy Basil Noodles wins there), it is by far and away my favorite for curry in the city. The pumpkin curry, in particular, is truly phenomenal. I love that they don't scrimp on the veggies/meat (no big bowl of sauce here), that the veggies are varied/interesting, that they have really great brown rice for accompaniment, and that the spice level here is actually legit. Granted, when I order a higher spice level the server often second-guesses me, but once I verify that I do indeed want my curry hot, they deliver (something that's been lacking at other Thai restaurants).

"Crispy calamari" turned out to be 8 (I counted) small calamari rings that were deep fried beyond recognition and were impossible to bite through. Like bad onion rings. Just terrible! And for $6.50 it has to be the one item on the menu you absolutely must never order! Talk about a bad taste in my mouth! I\'m willing to overlook them and just take it as a lesson learned.\n\nThe spring rolls are a delight, the pork ginger was spectacular with spice level right on, and seafood entrees are very good as well. Lunch size portions are sizable and a really good value not to mention super tasty. I\'d give the food a solid 4 star rating.\n\nThe atmosphere, however, is abysmal. I\'d give it 1 star. People tell you its small. That\'s an understatement. Small, crowded, uncomfortable. And in the winter, the front door opening and closing brings the temp inside down 5-10 degrees each time. BRRRR.  The setting is like someone set up tables in your grandma\'s living room and said, oh wait, we can add one or two more in here, you don\'t mind do you? - now sit down and enjoy!

First, I *live* down the street from Smiling Banana Leaf, so I\'ve had the dubious pleasure of going there more than once.

It\'s always gummy, and sometimes it\'s downright odd-tasting. In fact, if you look through the kitchen doorway on the way in, you can SEE the big bin of pre-cooked chicken. \n\nThat\'s IF you manage to find the chicken in your selected curry at all. Last time I was there, I ordered the mussaman curry. As some other reviewer pointed out, it had crinkle-cut carrots in it. I ordered the extra chicken. The extra chicken tasted odd, but at least it was on the plate. The time before that, I got the green curry and it came with possibly eight pieces of thin chicken bits.\n\nAnother time, I ordered the pad thai. "Pad thai," I thought, "hard to f**k that up." It came in a nondescript brown sauce, no vegetables, very little tofu, and black bits stuck to the egg in the noodles. \n\nThe Pad See Ew is OK if you\'re hungry, but feels somewhat one-dimensional.\n\nAnd then there\'s the issue of their fried dumplings. Who sticks these things in a deep fryer? The last time I had them, they were unpleasantly crispy and overly oily. \n\nAnyway, I\'m posting this because I can\'t for the life of me understand why this place is rated so highly.

I stopped by with a friend on Sat. evening to get take-out.  I ordered the pad see ew with shrimp (spice level: 4), and she ordered the ginger chicken (spice level: 3).  I'm not sure if they accidentally transposed the spice levels, but her food was so spicy it was inedible to both of us.  My food, on the other hand, had about the amount of spice that I like.\n\nIn addition to the shrimp, my pad see ew came with what appeared to be small pieces of chicken.  I was a bit surprised by the paucity of shrimp--but then again, I'm not super-familiar with this dish, so they could just be an add-on.  The flavor was okay, but didn't wow me.  The vegetables were well-cooked and not limp, which was nice.  The two dishes came with a side of rice, though it was unclear which dish it went with, which we ended up splitting.  Because of the inedibility of the ginger chicken, my friend and I ended up splitting the pad see ew--fortunately, there was enough to do that.\n\nI should mention that my friend, who lives in Morningside, is a frequent customer of SBL, and has ordered the ginger chicken (in addition to other dishes) many times before.  As such, she was surprised at the inconsistency in the spice.  One level up shouldn't have been that much hotter!\n\nI tried the ginger chicken and didn't care for the dish's flavor, so when my friend offered the rest of it to me, I declined.  I did take the rest of the pad see ew and finished it tonight, but was debating not doing so.  Ultimately, a combination of hunger and being out late got the best of me, though.

It is out of the way so it took until yesterday to finally try it after a visit to the zoo.\n\nThankfully we were early enough that there was no wait because the dining room is so tiny.  I think there may have been about five or six tables total.  Where we were seated was bench seating on one side and metal chairs on the other.  They each had cushions but weren't exactly comfortable.  \n\nThe server seemed a bit frazzled which didn't make sense because there was only on other table that was occupied.

That being said, they were willing to get the information and not be rude about it or write our questions off.\n\nWe started with a Thom Kha soup and peanut satay.  The soup was a hit.  A perfect blend of sweet coconut and spice.  It was LOADED with vegetables.  Almost too many for the fairly small bowl.  Friends wanted to order the fresh roll of the day but apparently they hadn't made them yet (even though it was after 5:00).\n\nMy husband ordered the pad kee mao and although he enjoyed it, said he has had much better elsewhere.

We wonder if they accidently switched the spice levels of our dishes because it had a crazy kick.  It was extremely tasty, though.\n\nOur friends ordered entrees with brown rice and both came out with white rice.  When more rice was brought out, even though they both ordered the same rice, it was different.  Not sure why, but they both enjoyed it.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed my dining experience here and would be back more often if it was closer to the areas that we tend to frequent.", 'business_id': 'vcZWlI0eHiGwlUfP-5Ov8Q', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2014-11-10', 'type': 'review'}

YUM! They use eggplant in that one, which is smokey and juicy and was the envy of the table. I can't speak for the lunch sizes, but the dinner portions are plenty. My girlfriend and I used to split a single curry all the time, but I doubt many others would agree with me on that one!\n\nI love the tom yum and tom kha soups. I am vegetarian and was told in the past I could get vegetarian tom yum... but apparently ALL soup bases are currently made with chicken broth - or at least this is what our server told us on our last visit in January 2015.\n\nRegarding spice levels... I'd say the soups are all spicy, so order low spice levels if you please. The tom yum is always very hot. Noodle dishes (pad see ew, etc) can be ordered at a spice level 0, if you'd prefer. The curries are obviously spicy, but very closely match the expected levels, so order spice levels moderately and you shouldn't be disappointed (or surprised!)", 'business_id': 'vcZWlI0eHiGwlUfP-5Ov8Q', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2015-01-28', 'type': 'review'}

This place is BYOB  and no additional fee for corking - definite bonus in my book. Their waitress was new and it was a bit difficult to get someone's attention. It wasn't overly busy when we went on a Monday night, but it took multiple tries to get the attention of the waitresses. \n\nFirst impression is that the place is very cute. Has a very hipster rustic feel for being a Thai restaurant. The interior has a good mood lighting - nice atmosphere. It was pretty cold though. Granted I went on a freezing day but we were seated right by the window so it was way more draft than I would have enjoyed. \n\nTOFU PARADISE --\nWasn't sure what to expect when I ordered this but I was surprised. They used a former tofu and cut into bite size pieces. I thought the cabbage was the best part to be honest because it had a little sweetness but not so sweet as the peanut sauce. It was a bit too much for my tastes, but slowly grew on me. \n\nYELLOW CURRY NOODLES --\nThis was surprisingly good. A healthy (huge...let's face it it's not really good for you), portion of yellow curry, noodles, bean sprouts, chicken, red onion, and topped with fried onions. I got a 6/10 on the spicy scale and I will give it to them - it was pretty spicy. I think next time I'll go with a 5. If you're not good with spicy foods I would urge you to opt for a 1-2. The broth was really well made and flavored. And there was such a big portion I could have taken the rest to go and had left overs with rice. \n\nMy friend got the pad Thai which I did not try, but I thought her portion was rather small for the dinner price. I expected a bit more. Compared to other Thai restaurants I am inclined to say their portion to price ratio is smaller. \n\nTheir menu offered a pretty wide variety of appetizers, rice, noodle, and other dishes.

We love Thai food, and we have tried almost every Thai restaurant within a 5-radius of Shadyside--except this one. So, of course, we had to try this place out before we graduate to the 10-mile radius and beyond (gas prices and traffic be damned, we want our fill of Thai goodness!).\n\nAnyway, I arrived first, and the waiter (manager? owner? Sorry I can't be sure, but he's the one with the French accent) greeted me warmly and sat me down first. I told him two more people were going to arrive soon, so he quickly got me three glasses of iced water, menus, and silverware. After my friends arrive, he comes to introduce himself and the restaurant, and asked if we would like any beverages. One of my friends orders some tea, which he gets for her in no time. After perusing the menu for a few minutes, we order our food. I ordered the Green Curry Noodles with Tofu (spice level: 4), and my friends ordered Pad Thai with Shrimp (spice level: 0 [she doesn't do well with spicy food]) and Pad See Ew with Tofu (spice level: 3). It wasn't very busy at this time, so our food came out within 10-15 minutes.\n\nMy Green Curry Noodles with Tofu looked great. It had rice noodles, bell peppers, green beans, broccoli, eggplant, and Thai basil. I took a few sips of the broth and tasted really good and had a nice kick to it. My friends also really liked their respective dishes. Halfway through our meal, the place really started getting busy. It seemed like between each bite/sip of my food, a table or two became filled. By the time we were ready to leave, the place was packed. Nevertheless, our waiter never failed to refill our glasses with water and ask if we needed anything. When we were done, he got us a few take-out boxes for our leftovers and the check. Because of the good food and excellent service, my friends and I decided to give a generous tip.\n\nOverall, a very good place to have a nice Thai meal. Although it wasn't the best I've had, it does rank pretty high in my personal list of Thai restaurants. I will make an effort to come back again to try their Pad Thai, which is one of my favorite Thai dishes, and their desserts. Honestly, who could resist Pumpkin Custard or the Sago & Black Bean with Coconut Cream? Even though I'm allergic to mangoes, I'll even try their seasonal Sweet Mango with Sticky Rice (with 911 on speed dial, of course!).", 'business_id': 'vcZWlI0eHiGwlUfP-5Ov8Q', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2015-03-28', 'type': 'review'}

Our food came out to us with record-breaking speed, and both dishes had a lot of flavor. My only warning would be with regard to the spice level.  I like spicy food, and I thought I was being safe by ordering a 6 (out of 10), and it was still pretty darn hot (pore-sweating hot)! Overall, we had a very enjoyable experience and would definitely recommend this restaurant!", 'business_id': 'vcZWlI0eHiGwlUfP-5Ov8Q', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2015-10-10', 'type': 'review'}

The place is quite small and gets really crowded, I saw a few people turning back since the wait was so long and hence a reservation is highly recommended. \nWe ordered the crab rangoons as an appetizer, and Thai red curry and cashew stir fry for for the main portion. I would watch the spice level here definitely and order a level lower. I usually get a 7 in Thai restaurants, but my dish turned out more spicy than my liking. That being said the food was extremely delicious. The cashew stir fry was so flavorful and heavenly. The red curry was delicious too. The crab rangoons were good as well.\nOverall a pleasant and delicious dinner, and we will come back to explore other dishes on the menu.', 'business_id': 'vcZWlI0eHiGwlUfP-5Ov8Q', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2015-10-16', 'type': 'review'}

Each time, whether for take out or dining in, service has been consistently polite and prompt.\n\nIve been here on a Sunday afternoon when Bobby and I are the only ones in the tiny place and I also stopped by last Friday night for dinner with my dad and Bobby.  At 8pm, the place was stuffed full and a whiff of sweaty muggy people hit me in my face as I walked in the door.  Definitely should have made a reservation.  The host told me it would be about  a 30 minute wait but offered to take my name and phone number if anything opened up sooner.\n\nI stepped outside to decide what we would do and saw 3 outside tables not in use!  With Pittsburgh weather the way that it is, it just so happened to be about 68 that night.  I asked if the host would seat us outside and he agreed.  Shortly after, the other two tables filled!  Lucky us!\n\n\nAt this point I have tried many of their dishes - chicken rad na, yellow curry, pumpkin curry, chicken pad thai and I have had zero complaints.  Bobby tried a noodle soup and it was uneventful.  Really love Smiling Banana Leaf :)', 'business_id': 'vcZWlI0eHiGwlUfP-5Ov8Q', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2015-11-09', 'type': 'review'}

The food was worthy of 4 stars - we had Tom yam and Tom kha soups, both very tasty and well done - possibly worthy of 5 stars! Our entrees were Kao soy noodles and chilli shrimp with rice. Both tasted great! But the chilli shrimp was $14 and only came with 6 regular sized shrimp and a ton of vegetables. A bit too few for the price. The Kao Soy had a generous serving of pork. \n\nMy 3 star review is based on the service we received. While it wasn't bad, our server, a young girl, was not very warm or pleasant, which made the atmosphere that night feel very cold. I just felt very uneasy with the service we received - or waitress was also more interested in sitting down and playing with her phone right in front of the entrance rather than putting a smile on her face.\n\nOverall, food is good, but I have had better overall experiences at other Thai restaurants in Burgh.", 'business_id': 'vcZWlI0eHiGwlUfP-5Ov8Q', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2015-11-30', 'type': 'review'}

They are not bad but I think there are a lot of much better thai restaurants around Pittsburgh. Because Pittsburgh has so many thai restaurants to choose from there's much more competition to be the best restaurant. It also makes me a little more picky when critiquing a restaurant because there are so many good ones to choose from around the city. \nI started with the vegetarian spring rolls which I did not like at all. They were dry and tough and hardly any flavor. I also ordered the Tom Kha soup which was so good. And my entree was the mango tilapia which was decent but a tad too much sauce. \nI don't regret eating there however I don't think I'll bother going back.", 'business_id': 'vcZWlI0eHiGwlUfP-5Ov8Q', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2015-12-02', 'type': 'review'}

One of the absolute best deserts I have ever had!!!\nMy buddy got fried and steamed pork dumplings. I had one of each. Spot on! \nCashew Stir Fry. He said it was phenomenal!
