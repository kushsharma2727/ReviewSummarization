It's small but reasonably priced and offers a fine selection of food. No real surprises, it's what's become the standard buffet lineup of entrees, an omelet/pancake station, and southwestern and Chinese dishes. Sunday Brunch offers some extra seafood (shrimp, crab) and champagne. It's not the good stuff, but believe me, after a glass or two you won't notice.\n\nI was lucky enough to visit champagne brunch with a group of frinds who also like to play with their food. The buffet selection inspired me to assemble a southern-style plate of fried chicken and waffles with a side of fruit that tasted divine. Then I hit the dessert bar. Again, nothing fancy here, but a nice array of cakes and pies with soft serve ice cream also available. Extra credit to the buffet for offering sugar free pies and cake as well.\n\nThe best thing about the Paradise Buffet may be the decor. It has the darker feel of classic Vegas casinos, but there is an attempt at tropical lushness with plastic greenery and flowers throughout and a large aquarium at the entrance. The buffet is set off by crystal-accented chandeliers and lighting, the ceiling is all mirrored tile. Liberace would've been right at home here - and I mean that in the best way possible.\n\nOne star off my rating for a poor first impression: the restrooms are at the entry and they may be the first thing you smell coming in from the casino.

My friend who's also from the islands goes to this place all the time.  So, when I went to Vegas with him, he had nothing but good things to say about this place.  The secret?  Bypass the Buffet.  All the mainlanders eat the buffet.  But if you're from the islands, you have to eat at the Paradise Cafe in the back.  The lighting is dim, but who cares, I don't like people watching me eat anyways.  I've actually got in a fight with people who stare at me.  Anyways, go back there and be treated to the REAL island food.  Spam, rice (the sticky kind that's washed - not the minute rice that no self respecting islander would ever touch), Portuguese sausage, etc.  If you don't wash your medium grain rice and then measure it with your finger, you might not be using authentic sticky rice.  So, I walk into this place and see this nice buffet spread.  My friend tells me to keep walking and leave the buffet alone.  So I do.  We end up in the back at the Paradise Cafe where I see nothing but islanders eating.  This place MUST be good.  So we sit down and our waitress come around.  She has an island accent so I know this is going to be good.  What does everyone order?  Spam, eggs, and rice.  Now, I don't know if you know this, but the islanders like to eat.  So, when they bring our food out, it's overflowing over the plate.  They put a full can of fried Spam, a dozen eggs, and 2 cups of rice on my plate.  I also ordered Portuguese Sausage.  This is some good stuff.  The waitress keeps coming by asking if we want anything else.  Heck yeah.  We need more rice.  She hooks us up on the rice too.  She brought out a BIG bowl of rice so we can finish our Spam and sausage.  I can't finish my food, but everyone else doesn't have a problem with it.  For some reason my friend also ordered toast with it.  Toast?  Why not more rice instead of toast?  I think he sold out.  I keep looking around and it's nothing but islanders walking in.  She comes by to see if we needed anything else but we were good.  We then start asking her about some local island/asian store around here that we can get portuguese sausage.  She starts to tell us about some place that everyone goes to.  I was tempted but since I live in Cali, it would have gone bad by the time I got home.

I had lemon meringue pie, key lime cheesecake, and a mini eclair. \n\nMe: Okay, I\'m full.\n\nThe second funny thing was this little kid kept running around the buffet line and the manager chasing him down to scold his parents.  The last funny thing is the woman who took her sweet time and had to make everything neat on her plate.\n\nBecause the Fremont Hotel is part of the Sam Boyd Chain, the meal cost us $6 each.

But can't go wrong with a $26 dinner for two.  \nEndulge....all you can eat!  Went straight for the roast beef roast and mash potatoes.  Not bad.

Overall selection was not good for sushi.  New York Steak - 6 oz Grilled to medium rare.  The chef cooking it was more entertaining than the steak.   Crab legs were good.  Not the biggest but they were good.  The selections were good for the price.  Gotta love the soft serve ice cream.  This was not bad tasting considering I've tried some that just tasted like frozen milk.  I was too stuffed that I didn't get to try the Tacos, duck, and hot food items.  Salad bar was decent.  Dessert selection was okay with the different pies and cakes.  And the slices were sizely okay.  If you want to stuff yourself with a budget......go.  Don't expect much from though and you'll enjoy the experience.

We stop here every time our trip coincides with one of the seafood nights (Tuesday and Friday). The soup of the day rotates and it is always a special treat when it is the clam chowder. The cold seafood continues to be the highlight of this buffet although the hot foods have gotten slightly better (although not enough yet to make this a 5 star buffet even at the very affordable price). We have turned many of our friends onto this place and the 11pm closing time is great for our friends that drive in from Southern California after work on Fridays. On our last trip, the crab legs were no longer split. I prefer them split as it makes them easier to eat, but I know others feel unsplit crab legs retain their taste better. The biggest surprise was that they now have added snow crab claws. They were delicious despite being a little hard to eat (although once you learn the trick they're easier to eat than snow crab legs even with the harder shell).\n_______________________________________________________________\n\nThis was the surprise of my last trip. I really wasn't expecting much since you never really hear about any downtown buffets outside of the one at the Fremont's sister property: Main Street Station. Well, we were hungry and the seafood fantasy night sounded good so we decided to give it a shot. \n\nThe room it is served in might be described as tacky by some, but I really like it. It has that old school feel. This is actually where Trent and Mikey ended up eating after losing all their money in Swingers. That movie does not come close to capturing the feel of this room. Plus the service was pretty good. \n\nThe main draws of seafood fantasy night are the snow crab legs (split for easier eating), oysters, and peel and eat shrimp. The crab was pretty good. The shrimp tasted good too, but they were seasoned and I would have preferred them unseasoned. The oysters were awesome. I ate about a dozen and my friend had 2 dozen. I'm sure others in the buffet had more. These oysters were small, but tasted good and fresh. They were as good as any other oysters I've ever had; just smaller. I usually am weary of buffet oysters, even the Rio's famous seafood buffet has terrible oysters, but these were good. They also have a small sushi section which was pretty basic shrimp nigiri and California roll variations. I'm surprised they didn't have more variety. They also have a clam chowder that no one notices because they put it next to the honeydew melon. I had actually finished eating and wanted to get a few pieces of melon for dessert when I noticed it and got a bowl. The chowder is very good. My friend said it was the best thing at the buffet. He ended up skipping dessert and eating another bowl of the chowder. Actually, instead of using the little chowder bowls, he grabbed an ice cream sundae bowl from the dessert station and got himself a huge bowl of clam chowder.\n\nThe other items in the buffet are also mostly seafood. Nothing really stood out except for the trout which was very good. Some of the items were a little on the dry side such as the lasagna that had almost no ricotta and the seafood enchiladas. I would have preferred it if they kept more of their regular dishes instead of doing so many seafood dishes on seafood fantasy night. I like a little turf with my surf and the only items that weren't seafood, bread, or vegetables were the meats at the carving station and the fried chicken.\n\nAll in all, I was really impressed by the quality and price.", 'business_id': 'wFN75sAjpPpYnf0De8QssA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2009-08-22', 'type': 'review'}

I think I had bacon, sausage, eggs, waffles, french toast, and some fresh fruit for breakfast. After that we digested for a few minutes then I had prime rib, mashed potatoes and gravy and then some ice cream for dessert. Impossible? I think not.

I didn't much care for the stone crab claws (my least favorite kind of crab). The peel-and-eat shrimp was very pleasantly spiced, another winner.

Been here for buffets which were decent.  Wanting to avoid the long buffet line, we opted to be seated for the cafe.  Getting seats for 6 seemed to be a challenge.  We were directed to the back and was told someone would be waiting for us to seat us.  Alas, no one was so we just seated ourselves.  What appeared to be confusion as another server asked us if we were supposed to be seated there or not.  Turns out, it was the right place.  Anyway, we waited....hmmmm... quite a while.  It seemed longer withTWO antsy toddlers who weren\'t shy about declaring their state of hunger.  The waiter hurriedly walked by and said he\'d be right there.  He appeared to be on the verge of a hissy fit.   \nWe waited AGAIN even longer.  Finally, annoyed with the wait since we had just arrived to Vegas after roadtripping 5 hours, I walked over to the waiter station and asked for someone to bring us drinks.  \nA minute later, our huffy server shows up with no greeting and asks us for our drink order.  We were already ready to order.  \nAgain,  another long wait.  I looked at my watch and noticed it\'s been over 20 minutes with NO DRINKS!  This has been my worst experience at the Fremont Hotel.  Again, I walked over to the wait station and asked for assistance. \nAbout another few minutes go by and then our drinks arrive.  No apology or explanation about the delay.  \nThen our food arrives.  Now, the food was ok.  The American cuisine was pretty good.   But how do you screw up a patty melt or fried saimin noodles anyway? The Asian iterations could have been better.  The Korean ribs were not authentic.  Ok,if you like your bbq really sweet or never had true Korean marinated ribs.  \nWe noticed patrons who arrived long after us who already received their drinks and their food arrived at about the same time as ours.  NICE....\nWhile we were finishing up our food, the server tells us he\'s going on a break and that "so and so" would take care of us.  Well it was a while before we saw this person since usually, we\'re introduced to the new server.\nAnyway, this new server couldnt have been nicer.  She had a friendly disposition and almost simulataneously, hubby and I exclaimed we should have had her as our server plus our original server was going on a break?   It appeared he went on a break while we waited for our drinks.  Funny thing is, we devoured our food and was out of there so soon after we received our entrees.   \nThe new server was more empathatic and tried to explain how slammed they were with a new cook and that the previous patrons gave our server a difficult time.  My point was that it doesnt take THAT long to bring drinks and explain the situation.  Plus, why are we being punished because of other high maintenance sh**heads!!!  If the food was really crappy, I would give 1 star but the buffets I\'ve experienced in the past were decent.  At the rate we were going, we could have just waited for the buffet...it may have been faster!', 'business_id': 'wFN75sAjpPpYnf0De8QssA', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2009-10-11', 'type': 'review'}

I've eaten here twice and will constantly go back.\n\nI enjoy buffets immensly. I think it's the idea that I can keep going back to try many things all for one price and I know that that's why I enjoy The Paradise Buffet so much.\n\nFirst of all, the place is dirt cheap, even by Vegas standards. 8 dollars for lunch anywhere is pretty good, but in Sin City, it's an outright steal. Plus, it's cheaper than Hometown Buffet, slightly more gourmet, and best of all, void of annoying children running around eating nothing but jello and pudding.\n\nWhile the selection is a little on the low side, the food is actually quite good. The roast beef was rare and flavorful, the mashed potatoes were thick and fluffy, the salad bar was full of green, fresh lettuce and a great variety of toppings for it. They even have an option for your own burgers and hot dogs. \n\nThe atmosphere is defiantly jaded (but so is most of old town Vegas) and yes the waiters/waitresses seem to be on the tired side, but those are things I can easily overlook when it comes to cheap, tasty buffets. You can spend 35 dollars on a buffet at the Wynn or you can drive 5 minutes up to Fremont and have lunch for next to nothing...and keep all that extra money to win big on their cheap tables.", 'business_id': 'wFN75sAjpPpYnf0De8QssA', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2011-01-29', 'type': 'review'}

Still no waitress or water on the table. 1/3 way through plate one, I ask a hostess for water, she tells me waitress will be there soon, but she\'s really busy.....\n\nA minute or two later a waitress checks in on the table RIGHT next to me and asks if they need anything else and she starts to walk away..I flag her down and ask her for water, she said no, I\'m not in her section and your waitress was very busy but would be there shortly.\n\nFew more minutes go by and yet another hostess walks by, and I again plead for a glass of water. She stops, picks up the receipt, and says "you haven\'t even been here that long, your waitress will be here soon." She proceeds to go stand by the podium and do nothing. \n\nI finish plate and go grab another. Pretty annoyed. I get back and yet another employee walks by and again, I plead for a glass of water. I\'m now nearing the point of just standing and up and screaming can I get a fucking glass of water. The employee says he can\'t get me water, but will go get my server. FINALLY my server comes over, no apology for the wait, no nothing..just a glare at me and "what do you want?"\n\nI wanted to say, I\'d like to eat at a place where the servers aren\'t bitches, but requested a water and juice.

I was not very impressed with the decor. It is like sitting in the middle of a jungle. It is quite bright in a colorful way. A bit on the gaudy side to me. But I look forward to going back again. There are a few things there that make me say that. First of all was the service. I sat down and within moments someone came by to take my drink order. When I sat back down after getting my first plate my beverage was there and the glass never went empty. I don't mean that I didn't drink much. I mean that before my glass went empty each time a new glass was brought to may table. Every time I finished a plate, cup, or bowl within moments of me setting it aside it was whisked away. I am very surprised that for a small hotel buffet the service ranks as high as some high priced restaurants I have been in.\n\nAnother thing that surprised me was the quality of the food. I was not expecting such good food. The buffet is not very big but what they have is big on flavor. The roast beef was succulent and had a flavor that lets you know what a good beef tastes like.

The dining room looks like it is a leftover set from The Golden Girls, but with more tropical floral patterns and crystal chandeliers. \n\nNow the food itself.  I went to the Seafood Spectacular, or whatever it's called, and  had a coupon.  There were piles of seafood in every direction.  And they split the crab legs for you because as Americans, that's something we can't even do anymore.  And like I said, aside from the suspected bad oysters, it was all mediocre, so just kind of meh.\n\nIf you're set on having seafood, you could do worse.

Plus, parking is only free if you get a validation, so remember to save your receipt.\n\nGranted, this place is in the Fremont Casino on Fremont, instead of south on the strip with the better and higher end casinos. I figure that is why this place is cheaper, but the food was not that good and the dining area could have used a good remodeling. Basically, this is in an older casino in the older part of Vegas that is last on the list of where tourists visit.\n\nI also do not recommend getting there at the cut-off point between breakfast and lunch, because there is a several-minute delay in when the lunch items are brought out. When we went there to pay, we were told that we had 2 minutes left in the breakfast buffet and if we paid for that, then breakfast items would be cleared soon and we could not get any of the lunch items. And so we opted for the lunch buffet. Really, is the food police going to care whether I grab breakfast or lunch items?\n\nI went ahead and grabbed a few breakfast items anyway, such as pancakes, bacon, and country-fried potatoes. The bacon had little to no taste, but the pancakes and potatoes were pretty decent. Then when some lunch items came out, I helped myself to those. The best thing there was the chicken breast.\n\nService is practically non-existent, and we ended up having to grab our own silverware and condiments. At least they took away dirty plates in a timely manner.\n\nThis buffet may be cheap and the best in the Fremont area, but that does not factor the strip into account.

So what attracts the eye as you stroll down through the casinos? All You Can Eat Prime Rib Buffet for $13.00.  Now if that doesn't get your juices pumping I don't now what does.  SO with that said, A group of us went there to give it a shot as we were clueless as to what else we want to try and figured the buffet would give us some options.  We walked into the line and there were quite a few people ahead of us (good sign right?).  The food there definitely matched the price we paid for it.  Now I am not the one to judge solely on a few items and by looks alone so I decided to try at least one thing from each section.  \n\nFirst the good part: the Prime Rib was pretty tasty.  Not the best Prime Rib, but hey, I can't complain at this point.  It was definitely was savory and I was lucky enough to get it fresh when it came out.  If you decide to eat here just load up on this, you'll be happy...trust me.  The desserts were the next highlight.  The soft serve ice cream rivals that you get from a Souplantation with minimal toppings (fudge, nuts, strawberry in thick fruit sauce) but you can't really mess up when it comes to ice cream.  \n\nThe bad part: The sushi can definitely be skipped at this place.  I normally don't have high hopes for sushi at buffets but this one is nestled right next to the soft serve ice cream dispenser and cakes.  Again minimal selection and the the rice that was used was spongy.  I mean..i can take a little stale, but this just felt like I was eating something artificial.  \n\nThe rest of the food was below par (tried the fish, chicken, chow mien, and yams)....cannot comment on how it all tastes cause it was all just pretty much the same consistency as everything else.  If you are looking to save a few bucks, get some steak, and maybe load up on juices I'd say you can come here.

Paradise Buffet, located in the Freemont Casino, is your stereotypical cheap Vegas buffet with tons of food items but lacking in quality\n\nParking:\nParking available in the Freemont Casino.  \n\nAtmosphere:\nKinda tacky. Think of dark rain forest, mirrors and green vinyl booths. All that and a big buffet.   I\'m pretty sure this restaurant was featured in "Swingers" as the place the guys got dinner after they lost the money at the tables.\n\nService:\nThis restaurant is both a Buffet and standard restaurant service.  For the handful of times I\'ve been service has been fine without complaints. For both the Buffet and standard service waiters have been attentive and fast. If you have any problems its just getting into the place where if you go buffet you pre pay.\n\nCost:\nSo for the Buffet it ranges from $7-8(breakfast & lunch) to $20(Tues night Seafood).  For the most part the standard buffet you\'re going to get your money worth for $14 although for Seafood night you could do better.  For standard restaurant service  most food ranges from $6-11 so depending on what time you go and what you want to eat it might be a better deal just to get the buffet.\n\nFood:\nLike many Las Vegas buffets the food is just alright.  Well at least nobody ever got sick when they were with me.   I think the weekend breakfast brunch was my most favorite just do selection.  The times I\'ve been the dessert selection was rather good.\n\nConclusion:\nParadise Buffet is just your typical Vegas cheap buffet. Nothing amazing but your also not breaking the bank to get some food.

If this is the biggest and the best I would truly hate to see the others.  We were here on "steak night."  Price was $14.99/person.  I think you get a $1 discount if you have a players card for the casino.\n\nI should probably preface this review by saying we ate at Bacchanal a couple days prior to eating here at the Paradise buffet.  I knew we would not get the same quality of food as at Bacchanal, but good lord... The salad bar was kind of gross.  Their "fresh meats and cheeses" section was packaged lunch meat and Kraft singles (probably generic, not even Kraft).  I am not kidding.  The hot food section was... limited.  I think there were maybe 10 food choices total with a meat carving section in the center.  One of the meats available was ham.  They had a maybe 2" thick end piece of a ham sitting there that was dry and crusty.  They never replaced it the whole time we were there (which, granted, was not long) and it never got smaller, which means no one else was foolish enough to ask for any either.\n\nBeing that it was steak night we expected to see steaks.  Well, there were some very thin cuts of steak being grilled.  They ask how you want yours cooked but there\'s really no point - the meat is so thin they\'re all well done.  As far as the other hot food went, the only 2 things I actually enjoyed were a baked potato and a fried chicken leg, neither of which was worth $14.99.  They had a porkchop dish that was downright disgusting.  I did find a basket of nacho chips and a pot of scalding hot cheese sauce.  These were edible and I did like the fact that the chips were thick.  I saw some sushi but didn\'t get anywhere near it.\n\nDessert... only the sugar free items were labeled so we took a couple of things back to our table to try (hoping to figure out what they were).  We tried two different pies that had absolutely no flavor, a piece of chocolate cake that was kinda rubbery, and a slice of cheesecake that my husband deemed "ok."  We left the desserts on the plates with small bites out of them.  As I was walking through the restaurant I noticed several other tables with plates of desserts on them that looked exactly like ours.  The service was just ok - we had to wait a while for someone to come take our drink order but our plates were always cleared promptly.\n\nBottom line, pay more for a better buffet on the strip.  I wouldn\'t come back here, even if it was free.', 'business_id': 'wFN75sAjpPpYnf0De8QssA', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2013-04-08', 'type': 'review'}

Paradise Buffet and Cafe Restaurant reminded me why I avoid them.\n\nYes, it\'s Vegas. Yes, they are known for world-class food and excellent buffets. Just remember that NONE of them are located in Downtown Las Vegas. \n\nThe establishment is located in the Fremont casino. It\'s large and maze-y with roomy booths. The decor isn\'t vintage; it looks like a 1980s highschool set for Wizard of Oz. There\'s alot of green.\n\nFirst off, our waitress didn\'t know what half-and-half was when we requested it with coffee. She kept pointing to the french vanilla creamer already on the table. I already had a feeling I wasn\'t going to like this place....\n\nThey had a decent variety of food from American hot-dogs and patties wading in gray, hot water to Italian pasta, dried out from the hot lamps to "Chinese" stir-fry that could rival any MacCormack seasoning packet available at most grocery stores. I opted for jambalaya, fried chicken, mashed potatoes, and beef roast from the carving station. I\'ve never had jambalaya before (at this point) so wasn\'t sure what to expect; it tasted okay:lots of sausage and my friend told me it tasted like it came from a can. Can you go wrong with mashed potatoes? Yes, even Paradise can! When I attempted to add butter to the flavorless mash, I could only find margarine...Ugh, isn\'t anything real here? Not too surprising, after all, they didn\'t have half-and-half... Everything ersatz! \n\nFresh fruit and a piece of apple pie for dessert. Pretty sad when the fruit was the best part of the meal. \n\nLunch buffet cost about $9. A bargain, one might say, for a "Vegas" buffet. All the strip buffets were starting around $30.\n\nThere\'s a reason why the restrooms are located at the exit of the restaurant with large, brightly-lit signs. Now, I love food, and if that food disagrees with my digestion but it tastes delicious, I\'m willing to give a little leeway. When I eat a less than mediocre meal and additionally have the inconvenience and discomfort of immediately needing a restroom, I am not a happy camper. In toto, six out of our group of eight ended up in the restroom. The women\'s bathroom was clean, however, the males in our group recounted a disgusting state of the men\'s restroom.\n\nWhy 2 stars in stead of 1? Although the entire experience was sub-par, there is a possibility our 6 days of Vegas binging finally caught up to us and contributed to our sickened state. Even without sickness, not worth $9.', 'business_id': 'wFN75sAjpPpYnf0De8QssA', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2013-07-15', 'type': 'review'}

According to the menus that were hung everywhere in the casino that meant that it was prime rib night which I was eagerly looking to.  I also noticed on a ton of signs that is was the largest buffet on Fremont Street which is interesting since the Golden Nuggets the next morning seemed bigger.  As we were walking into the buffet I was quickly reminded of some Rain Forrest cafes that I had been to.  It had those large palm trees as well as some other lush tropical looking plants.\n\nThe food at this buffet was just ok.  It actually reminded me quite a bit of the Golden Corral, lots there but no quality to it.  Yes there were peel and eat shrimp and crab legs but they were fairly meager which I guess is indicative of the price here.  They are had a random collection of other ethnic foods including a taco bar, sushi and random Chinese food.  Finally the prime rib.  What can I say about the prime rib?  Was it really prime rib or was it another cut of a tougher meat?  I have never had prime rib with the amount of connective tissue that was in some of the pieces of meat that I had here.  With that being said I really enjoyed the Cajun-esque seasoning that they put on it and I went back for more 3 separate times.  The desserts were really where this place shines as there were a ton of them and what I had was pretty good.  I ended up having key lime pie sans the crust and some carrot cake and both we pretty tasty.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I might stop by here again in the future.  It's not the worst buffet that you can get downtown but its not the best either.

But at least with OCB, you didn't have to pay like $20.\n\nOf course, if you check-in on Foursquare you can save a few bucks on the buffet. But it is Vegas, and who wants to stand in line to save money on a buffet. Just put that five bucks into the machine instead and let it ride.\n\nBest bet: Skip this buffet and visit the Flamingo to just see the flamingos outside.", 'business_id': 'wFN75sAjpPpYnf0De8QssA', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2014-05-28', 'type': 'review'}

Their pancakes and belgian waffles were also amazing! Freshly made as well, so it's fluffy and soft :) \n\nTheir dinner buffet; however, did not impress. I went on their Steak night and that was pretty good. Cooked to order however you would like. Got my money's worth on that. Their Chicken Marsala was also good; it wasn't dry...phewf! Those were the 2 things that stood out to me. Everything else was average. I didn't like their soft serve or froyo or whatever it was. It's more like ice milk? \n\nAlso, if you want to do a la carte items, their Ox Tail Soup is really good and the portion is HUGE. Great flavors. When I got the saimen, it was soooo salty. I took out half the soup and added hot water. And even after adjusting the soup, I was soooo thirsty that night. \n\nI forgot who our server was, but she was so friendly!

It was suggested that we check out the Paradise Buffet since others had had good experiences making reservations. I called more than a month ahead but was told that they would not be able to take our reservation because it was Memorial Day weekend, but if we showed up at 4, when they opened, they would be able to seat us together. There would also be an 18% gratuity added automatically. So I said okay, let's do it. \nOur group of 16 showed up slightly before 4. The woman at the register didn't even look up from what she was doing to curtly inform us that the buffet didn't open until 4. We let her know that we just wanted to let them know that we were going to have a large group and wanted to sit together and would pay on the same check. She said we could just wait in line and they'd see what they could do. Grrr...\nAt four, we all went through the line and I paid for the 16 people (we had collected the money previously.) The total came out to more than I had expected but I brushed it off, thinking that my math had been off somewhere. We were seated at four different tables in the same area, as each table could only hold between 6 and 8 people. \nThe buffet wasn't anything special. We were there on their steak night, but the majority of the food was pretty buffet-standard. Pasta, mashed potatoes, chicken, vegetables, desserts, that sort of thing. But the food was good. \nIt began bothering me that the price was more than $20 more than what I had expected it was going to be. So I decided to go to the register and ask for another print out of the receipt. When the cashier handed it to me, I found that they had charged me for 18 people, not 16. But they were nice when I brought it up, and were prompt in giving me a refund for those two non-existent people. \nI don't want to give them anything more than a three because it wasn't amazing. The service was okay, the food way okay, and if it hadn't been for that mistake with the payment, I probably would have given it a 4.

I can honestly say that this is the worst buffet I've ever been to and I've been to plenty. Went there for prime rib night and was or course looking forward to trying their advertised prime rib. It was extremely blend and reminded me of the crappy pieces of meat I used to get for school lunch in first grade. The lasagna, macaroni salad, crab salad and even the desserts all tasted like last week's leftovers.

My girlfriend literally had to stop me from doing so by dragging me away. \n\nSo please, whatever you do, avoid this place at all cost.

I went on a weekday for breakfast/ lunch and they were closing all the stations for breakfast and bringing out lunch items. I spent a little over $30 for 3 people. I did get a chance to get an omelet from the omelet station. The ingredients were strewn all over the place and not much to choose from. I watched the guy make the omelet but, he loaded it up inside on cold cheese AFTER cooking it so, by the time I sat down to eat it, it was lukewarm. The cheese was still cold and didn't even melt. I couldn't even cut into it. I ate a few pieces of bacon, a greasy, tasteless sausage patty, and some sauteed potatoes that were old and cold as well and 2 child size cups of warm apple juice. Once lunch entrees finally came out, it wasn't any better. I sampled a fried chicken wing, some instant mashed potatoes that obviously came out of a box, a piece of roast beef that was overcooked and was tough like shoe leather. I also had a piece of Italian sausage that was quite salty and greasy. All of it was inedible. I wouldn't recommend this place. I won't be coming back. The atmosphere is dark and cheap, and the people working there looks like they're sorry they work in such a dump. I ended up eating a plate of salad which was actually fresh but, was a little too wet from washing the lettuce. Toppings were very limited but, seemed somewhat fresh. However, I won't be returning.

Friday night, Seafood 'Fantasy' night!\n\nBut alas, it was all just lackluster.  I'm sorry but I even forgot to take pics of my encounter with this lacking buffet.  I know for many tourists (especially Hawaii folks) just a buffet in general with all-you-can-eat crab legs is an endless wonder.  But when you're an LV local like myself you kinda expect more from your buffet!  Paradise Buffet was just borderline OK for me, not much I could find outstanding.\n\nThe crab legs are decent and plentiful at the buffet, but most of them are cold!  I like my crab legs warm, but there is not really any station setup for them to serve warm crab legs.  I don't think you can hand one of the chefs your plate and ask them to steam them for you either.  Wouldn't that be funny!  All I can say is please don't try this.  Do not interfere with an already disgruntled, busy chef.  That's asking for trouble!\n\nMost of the other offerings at Paradise Buffet were lacking as well.  The baked fish was alright, but after sitting under the heat lamp too long some pieces were tough.  Just FYI, if you go on a Friday night, it is mostly SEAFOOD being offered!  So if you're a meat-only type of person this is not your night.  Although they do serve a nice prime rib with au jus, which probably was the best thing I ate that night.  Medium-rare, extra au jus, and creamy horseradish on the side?  Made for some good eating.  But this is Las Vegas, every casino here has some kind of prime rib...it's practically a staple!  \n\nThe other seafood choices didn't impress me much.  The fried clams were either soggy or overcooked.  The pasta was eh, just pasta.  And the Mexican offerings that night were NO BUENO.  Just flavorless.  Don't get me started on the sushi that is served RIGHT NEXT TO the soft serve ice cream machine!  Talk about fusion!  Unfortunately the sushi was just plain terrible, dry rice & suspect raw fish.  Even the basic Cali Roll was falling apart.\n\nBesides the prime rib, the only other saving grace at this buffet for me was the sandwich station located at the salad bar.  Yes, the sandwich station.  Make your own sandwich with thinly sliced ham, turkey, or roast beef!  Then pick a cheese or 2!  I think only cheddar & mozzarella was offered that night.  A roast beef & turkey sandwich with cheddar and a ton of mayo helped save my sanity.  It wasn't gourmet, but it was familiar. \n\nHardest part about this buffet for me to swallow is that it's like $22 per person, that's with the B Connected players card!  Without the card it's an extra BUCK.  For me the value just wasn't there.  You can go to a local Chinese buffet with all-you-can-eat crab legs and still pay less than you would here.  And you can get Mongolian stir fry included!  And the very same soft serve ice cream machine.\n\nSorry to say Paradise Buffet, not impressed.  You're not bad, but for the price I would have rather have gone to a Station Casino buffet for less.  It might not have the crab legs but I could have done without them.  But don't get me wrong, the tourists love you!\n\n#crabby", 'business_id': 'wFN75sAjpPpYnf0De8QssA', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2015-11-20', 'type': 'review'}
