After seeing a heavy set lady with a dress on slide down and leave her booty juice.... again, nuff said). We looked over the menu and boss lady decides that we should try the fried rattlesnake and the Cowboy Platter. I\'m game, remember, she\'s paying. \n\nFried rattlesnake. What the he!! was I thinking? Must have been that quart sized drink I inhaled (remember, she\'s paying). Ok, what does it taste like? Popcorn chicken from KFC, over cooked. Again, nuff said. \n\nWe\'re discussing the merits of Fried rattlesnake (that darn drink again) when we hear a commotion. Running across the restaurant like the kitchen is on fire, come 3 waiters. One has a triangle and is screaming at the top of their lungs. And the other two have this massive metal platter between them, held above their heads. They are all screaming and heading for us. I\'m looking like an intoxicated (drink, boss, paying) deer in headlights as my auditory system catches up and sends the signal to my brain. "COWBOY SPECIAL, COWBOY SPECIAL, COWBOY SPECIAL" \n\nOh great, now everyone in the restaurant is looking at our eclectic little group. My little Asian boss, dressed in flowers from head to toe with her $350 pumps, my BGF who is about 6"5, 400# and bald as an egg, and me, the fully intoxicated (Drink, Boss, Free) Korean American in her business suit. \n\nThis platter had like 1/2 a cow, a chicken family and the 3 little pigs on it. I couldn\'t even begin to do it justice. It should have come with a warning. DO not eat for a week before ordering this special. Needless to say, I had an elephant bag to take with me after dinner (too much for a mere doggie). \n\nOh and the piece de resistance? Why my boss convinced me (Booze. Free. Boss) that the free country line dancing on the patio for everyone to see would be just the thing. WRONG! No rhythm when I\'m sober, so you know how this looked. Two left feet when I\'m not drinking.

It was charming to be served beer in Mason jars, even though the selection of draft beers could have been larger.  The fry bread we had while waiting for the rest of our party was good, though the chewiness indicated that it wasn\'t that fresh, but the cinnamon butter made up for it.  I opted for the Vaquero,a smaller steak served with cheese enchiladas.  The steak was decent, but the tortillas of the cheese enchiladas were quite chewy.  I think I should have opted for the filet, which my dining companions all got, and it came with green beans and corn.\n\nWould I go back?  Maybe if I had kids and was passing through town.  Otherwise, I\'ll be looking for somewhere with more focus on the food than the theme.', 'business_id': 'wZwZcte4lcbu51NOzCjWbQ', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2009-08-17', 'type': 'review'}

This was my first experience, and the first thing you notice is the amazing view. Being on a mountain, it provided great views of the city, over looked a golf course and was even nicer once the stars were out.\n\nIt definitely had the Old West feel. Walking to the entrance I smelled and noticed the large bull outside. Ahhh Smells like Ohio...at least the part of Ohio I used to hang out in...Going into the restaurant felt like a mine shaft. Wood all around, except for the large jagged rock jutting from the wall on the left and walking up a rather steep inclined ramp. When I emerged at the top, it was really cool. I felt like I was in Paint Your Wagon...the bartender was very cool and pointed out they have free happy hour buffet apps until 6. They had potato skins, veggies and a guy was in the process of changing out ribs for little chimis...He gave me a few ribs before taking them away.\n\nOnce my friend showed up, we grabbed a table that provided a good view. The drinks kept coming, and we ordered the appetizer sample that included somewhat rather skinny chicken wings, nachos, and fried mushrooms. \n\nThe downstairs had people in the steakhouse...and the steak smelled wonderful! Upstairs in the bar was basically just me and my friend. The waitress came around about every 5 minutes because she had nothing else to do. Not good to be that dead on a Friday night. She ended up getting to go home early because it was so quiet.\n\nWhat would I do next time? Try the steak. As I said, it smelled great. Try the fried rattlesnake...never had it and I would rather bite one than have one bite me...try that big-ass slide that went from upstairs to downstairs...and after several drinks maybe join in the line dancing downstairs with the live band. \n\nI had a good time here, but there were definitely more to be had.

I had never been. Had heard the name many times over the years when I had previously lived in Tempe. \n\nBeen intimidated that by where it set that it was expensive and swanky. That's all a lie! It sets up high and has a wonderful view. It's not located where you are just strolling down the street and decided to pop in that is true. You wind through these grounds to the back of the property pass beautiful fountains and buildings until you come to the lite up restaurant. You can self park but why bother go for the valet. \n\nYou pass a smelly ranch steer at the entry that is probably wondering why the hell its there as much as I was. Inside the door the smell escapes you immediately, thank goodness. You see some young sap making cotton candy and wonder what the heck have I arrived at. A few more steps and you see you are in a western theme establishment, by the overwhelming amount of raw wood beams and flooring. \nFirst stop the bar. It's a limited full bar and for this it losses a star. \nFrom the bar the view outside is great and you can look down and see the country music band playing (it was a band but I wouldn't book 'em) but hey they gave the place a little extra pulse. You see the staff in casual western gear also and you instantly know you're welcome in your jeans. \n\nMoments later our table was ready and half of us choose to take the slide down to the dining floor and the others took the steps. Hey I went for the slide! It was short and fast and another reason to come casually dressed. \n\nOur waitperson was a delightful and articulate young woman. We skipped the appetizers to leave room for dessert (next time I'll reverse that decision). The menu was very good. Several steak cuts, enchiladas, fried chicken, BBQ beef & pork ribs, Seafood, a burger, pork chops, most plates $15 - $20. \n\nWhile waiting for the salad course a magician name Flash comes up and asks if we'd like some magic that night (he works for tips). He went about his tricks and blew our minds! THIS GUY I WOULD HIGHER for an event. Never figured out how he did what he did but would love to see him doing it again and again. So if he comes by your table take him up on his offer of magic. \n\nThe food arrives, the salad is good and fresh the main courses come and all are cooked to perfection. My medium rare T-Bone was actually medium rare for once! My steak was tender and taste fabulous. The food didn't hold it's heat well and they serve sweet potatoes or rice with the dishes rather than standard baked/mashed or fried Idaho's (extra charge for a standard potato - why? - Minus another 1/2 star). But over all it was a good meal. We barely had room for the dessert so we split a 9 layer chocolate fudge cake and another dessert among us. And we still had four or so layers of cake left to go home! It was so rich and such a huge slice no 3 people could have eaten the entire thing following a meal if they tried... 4 of us dug into this slice. \n\nAll in all it its a great steakhouse. Prices lower than Lonestar and Steak portions (ounces) bigger for your money, plus a better all over food and appetizer menu by far. Oh yeah I'm a fan and will be returning again and again when I want a steakhouse to fill my steak cravings and a bit of entertaining to accompany the meal. \n\nI highly recommend Rustlers Rooste.", 'business_id': 'wZwZcte4lcbu51NOzCjWbQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2009-12-27', 'type': 'review'}

I wouldn\'t have minded the walk up but they have a shuttle that will take you so that was nice.  I guess the best way to describe this place is a big western saloon with an awesome view of the city.  Maybe "saloon" doesn\'t do it much justice but it is all I could think of.  It is just very westerny.\n\nThe place was pretty packed but we didn\'t mind because it would give us time to check out the place and maybe sit at the bar and get an ice cold Shiner that is on tap.  Well we tried that while waiting for a table but it looked like there was only one bar tender getting drinks for the bar patrons as well as the entire waitstaff for all the tables in the place.  Oh well.  After a few minutes were were seated and yes, we both took the slide down.  Oh, there was also a live band playing some country music and it was pretty good and not overly loud.  If I had a couple more drinks in my I probably would have tried to dance country style. \n\nOur waiter was very nice but some things took forever because the poor guy had like 17 tables.  I don\'t understand why places can\'t hire more waitstaff.  I mean they work basically for tips and there are probably plenty of people wanting jobs so wtf?  Anyway, he was very nice and did the best job he could.\n\nI love the Indian fry bread and biscuits they give you to start.  I could eat that stuff all night.  They give you like 3 different kinds of butter and honey to play with so it doesn\'t get much better than that.\n\nMy wife and I split the bone in rib eye and it was juicy, flavorful and delicious.  It was a bit fatty but that is how I like it.  My wife took the less marbled part so it all worked out.  With an entree you get a nice big salad, beans and corn.  It was all good and was plenty for 2 people.  I would definitely order the steak again but I think next time we are going to share some of their ribs.  I had them years ago and I remember them being very good.\n\nI know some people like it, especially the kids, but I don\'t like the random guys walking around making balloon animals and others doing magic tricks.  I try not to make eye contact with them so they don\'t come over because I just want to sit and enjoy my meal.\n\nAnyway, this place is pretty good and perfect to bring out-of-towners because it is very westerny and has a perfect view.

I walk in the doors and I\'m immediately offered two options to get to my table: the quick route -- the ever-so-popular slide -- or the boring way -- the stairs. The six year-old child in me screams "take the slide you coward!!" OK, what the hay right? After I\'ve recovered, I walk through sawdust lined wooden floors on my way to my seat. During my journey, I pass by a live band playing on the stage, the energetic waitstaff teaching visitors how to two-step, a magician mystifying the crowd, a photo prop inviting me to be a plump cowgirl and stuffed rattlesnakes peering at me from their containers. \n\nYou have just re-visited many, many of my nights throughout my life at Rustler\'s Rooste. \n\nRustler\'s Rooste is a classic and a must-visit if you\'re in town vacationing, you want to throw a party or you simply want to make it a cowboy adventure of a night out on the town. I\'ve been coming here since I could barely walk. As a child, I rarely left the slide area and would join the group of other children waiting in line to go up and down the slide the entire night while the grown-ups ate. Place a slide in a restaurant and it\'s endless hours of childhood fun. \n\nThe food is good and hearty. From flavorful BBQ chicken to tender ribs to juicy steak, I never leave hungry. Oh did someone say rattlesnake? Well yes, yes they do happen to serve that southwestern delicacy, but only if you\'re really in the mood for an adventure. I normally stick with the basics. \n\nI\'ve been to several events at Rustler\'s Rooste, including one of my favorites in the main ballroom equipped with long picnic tables and a stage for live music. Plus, the entire restaurant is situated on the rim of South Mountain and has spectacular views of the valley. Go during sunset. It\'s a romantic must. \n\nAs if the night couldn\'t possibly get more fun, they now serve cotton candy to all the guests at the end of the meal. The child in me screams with happiness every time I enter Rustler\'s Rooste and the adult in me loves that this is one of the only remaining restaurants where you can walk in and receive the true southwest experience. And even though I live in AZ, I absolutely love it when I visit and receive the reminder from Rustler\'s Rooste just how authentic and special AZ is, especially with gems like Rustler\'s Rooste!', 'business_id': 'wZwZcte4lcbu51NOzCjWbQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2010-07-28', 'type': 'review'}

This is a Western style eatery, with a real bull sitting outside pretty much every night. Gives it the "authentic" smell i guess. When you enter, you can decide to choose the "fun" entrance, which is sliding down this slide instead of walking down the stairs! haha...I loved that, definitely makes you feel like a little kid again.\n\nThere\'s a nice live band playing on most of the nights, so pretty lively place. When you get to your seat, it\'s in these traditional wood benches. Along the floor, you have the typical western style hay thrown about. Nice touch to it.\n\nTheir menu selection is the classic Western food. If you are adventurous, I recommend trying the Deef Fried Rattlesnake as a starter. They actually serve the meat in a different portion and bring out the entire ribs of the snake, which is also deep fried. Meat is nothing too unique, just a tad bit chewy, however very neat presentation.\n\nThe rest of the menu is pretty standard Western food: steak, beans, etc.\nAfter a hearty meal, I recommend standing outside the patio (when the weather is cooler) and enjoy the view of the valley. \n\n If you are looking for really high quality food, you probably won\'t come here as the price is pretty steep for just decent western food.

Maybe it was just a slow night, but it looked like they had plenty of room to take out a few tables, and make the remaining tables a bit bigger and space them a bit further apart.\n\nOverall, I'd go again, and I'd recommend taking friends and family from out of town there for dinner with a view.", 'business_id': 'wZwZcte4lcbu51NOzCjWbQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2011-02-03', 'type': 'review'}

The establishment sits near South Mountain here in phoenix and I must tell you the view is simply breathtaking. There is plenty of outdoor seating and that is a must do if you visit this place because again the view of the city and the surrounding mountains are not to be missed. My wife\'s company IKON office solutions hosted there annual party for the employees here and it was first class all the way. The gave away tons of prizes....check the photos I posted.....and everyone was so friendly.\n\nThis establishment is huge, which makes it great for hosting huge office parties like these. We had our own venue out back large enough to hold about 300 people or more and we still could move around. We didn\'t have to worry about disturbing other customers....because they were in the main dining hall of this establishment which is a throwback to the western days. There is live music and even an old school slide that you can ride down from the second level to the main eating level. There is also a huge steer out front as you come into the establishment....that\'s right a real life Texas steer....maybe not from Texas though....LOL.\n\nNow as for the food....well they served us BBQ chicken and ribs and I must say the Chicken was great....didn\'t try the ribs however....sorry....but my wife liked them. There were also baked beans...while not great...were not bad either. They also served homemade biscuits....corn on the cob...and there was a great garden salad as well. There was an open bar  for everyone to enjoy.....and I must say again the service....atmosphere...staff....food presentation....and ambience of this establishment were top notch.\n\nWARNING......WARNING.....WARNING....be advised that the parking here can be very bad. There is very limited parking on the "Main Hill" i will call it....right in front of the restaurant. There is plenty of parking "Down Hill"....which means you have to walk back up to reach the establishment....and trust me that is more than a notion folks. If your not in fairly good shape I recommend letting them valet park your car which is free....but tips are accepted....and you may have to wait awhile for you car when your ready to leave because they are pretty busy.\n\nThe other option is taking there shuttle bus....but you may be waiting for it as well. Since I am in pretty good shape I just walked back up the hill...but I would not advise that. Just wanted to put that out there because this city and state has a lot of elderly people and I would hate for them to come to this establishment and face this problem. So if your even in the mood for a little western adventure and great southwest cuisine visit rustler\'s Rooste and as always Eat, Drink and be Merry my Friends!!!!', 'business_id': 'wZwZcte4lcbu51NOzCjWbQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2011-02-22', 'type': 'review'}

We had to park in the bottom of the hill parking lot but they have a shuttle that we didn't take. Take the shuttle if you aren't wearing sneakers.  We showed up (6 of us) around 7 and were told it would be an hour wait.  After 15 minutes they had a booth for us. We walked past the live cow and got to take the slide downstairs. The hostess waited for us at the bottom of the slide. It was a booth that fit all 6 of us easily and we are not little petite people. The only drinks on the specialty menu had tequila but the das boote was recommended as a particularly girly drink. It is supposed to taste like melon but it tasted like Jello and came out on fire and you get to keep the boot glass! We ordered rattlesnake as an appetizer and it tasted like fried whitefish. It came with the snake's spine?\n4 of us ordered the Cowboy Stuff where you get everything for $22. Then the balloon man Frank came to the table. Even though we were all adults he made us balloon animals. He was fantastic! I got a giraffe with a different colored mane. My friends and BF got a T-rex, a monkey with banana and a motorcycle. I went outside to get a close up of the views and by the time I got back  our table was filled up with cowboy stuff. The sauce on the meat was delicious and the seafood was well cooked as in tasty. The potatoes made me feel as if I had died and gone to carb heaven. The beans were bland and the pineapple coleslaw disturbing but if that's the worst I can say about a place is that two of their sides weren't my favorite then I think it's all right. My friends that didn't order cowboy stuff got ribs. Deliciously tangy sauce with a little bit of heat.\nI was originally terrified by the idea of their live band as usually those are so loud you can't hold a conversation but they had their own section and rocked out.\nThere were a lot of kids around but none I would consider obnoxious. They seemed to burn off their over-stimulation riding down the slide and going up the stairs again. Our server was incredibly fast and somehow managed to see our drink glasses  through all of the stuff on the table and keep them filled.\nBasically it was fun enough we plan to come back within a month to celebrate a friend's birthday with a giant hat and an eclair the size of her head.

Should preface with the fact that we are vegetarian and were meeting a friend here who has wanted to check it out for a while. \n\nDrove up on a Saturday night at 7pm (apparently can\'t make reservations until after 8pm) and couldn\'t find any parking by the restaurant, weren\'t feeling in the mood for valet, so went down a decently sized hill to the extra parking lot. This resulted in us basically hiking to dinner, up a steep sidewalk with no stairs. Not sure how a family with any disabled or elderlies would handle this. Would have to pay for valet, I suppose. Walked to front door, hit with wall of "cow smell", and sure enough there was a HUGE longhorn just chillin out about ten feet away. Walked in, more ramps to hike up, finally made it to level ground at the front desk area. All the hostesses were basically wearing American flags for shirts and the servers were decked out in cowboy gear. We had a hard time getting the attention of the hostess taking names which was a little frustrating. We were surprised to be seated immediately having no reservation on Saturday night, but I suppose this place is SO HUGE that it isn\'t much of a problem for smaller parties. It took a couple minutes to get through the labyrinth and find our table, on the way passing the oh-so-popular slide that you can take from floor 2 to floor 1. \n\nSat down and tried to start a conversation, and were immediately interrupted by the triangle-wielding server army that came to the table next to us to sing Happy Birthday. Lots of banging and clanging served for a poor conversation atmosphere, and this was only the first of several birthday celebrations throughout our meal! We ordered a pitcher of the Arizona margarita to split between two people, and it was pretty darn huge. However the margarita was quite disappointing - all sugar and no alcohol. We finished the whole pitcher and felt nothing except slightly ill at the sugar content.\n\nWe ordered the one veggie menu item, the veggie burger. Our friends got the prime rib. The meal started with a large basket of fry bread and biscuits with regular and cinnamon butter, pretty standard but yummy. Then the server brought a huge salad for the table to share, tossed with ranch dressing. That was a nice touch that we didn\'t realize was included. The meal came, and we were pretty shocked to see that it included green beans, corn on the cob, steak fries, veggie chili, AND the burger!! We couldn\'t finish one meal between two people, and we are good eaters. Everything was good, but nothing special. The green beans seemed fresh though the corn did not. The steak fries were yummy. The burger was good (housemade I believe) but nothing special. Our friend really liked his prime rib. It looked well-prepared and gigantic, just like everything else in the joint. The meal ended with the server bringing a tin can full of cotton candy. Man, they just don\'t want you to live past 40 around here!!!\n\nFor vegetarians who never go to places like this, I\'d say we had close to the best experience we could have expected. It is a loud atmosphere and everything is pretty pricy - however, you are paying for a MASSIVE amount of food, so I suppose it works out. Our takeaways: Definitely split a meal, do NOT get the margaritas, and don\'t come here for a classy place and intimate conversation. You are coming for the experience (and the pretty spectacular view!).

Certainly nothing wrong with that, but maybe need to go further when you call yourself a steak house.\n\nThe outdoor eating area was amazing. The view was for miles.

Party of 4 on a Wednesday night.  No wait to be seated.  They had a live band which was nice but also made it hard to hear each other at the table.  All 4 of us had "a little of this, a little of that" which was 2 fillet medallions plus your choice of shrimp, swordfish or 1/2 rack of pork ribs.  Between the 4 of us we had every combination.  The meat comes with corn on the cob and either rice pilaf or green beans depending on your add-on meat choice.  Baked potatoes are extra $2.  Salad is included with the meal, but no choices of dressing.  It came pre-tossed with a ranch dressing.  It wasn\'t very good.  They bring baskets of rolls and biscuits.  They were ok, not nearly as god as Texas Roadhouse.  Our entrees were good and the view was beautiful.  The ambience was very nice other than being a little loud and we would definitely go back again.

One person in my party got crown on the rocks, i swear they were serving him his drink from their shot glasses.  RIP OFF!\n\nThe view is good (not great), the bull is real. the servers are good people, the atmosphere is typical for a steak place. That is where my positive experience ends.\n\nWhile scanning the menu i got to look out over Phoenix, it was nice to see all the "mountains" surrounding the city (i am used to seeing the Rocky and Olympic Mountains so yeah. not really mountains to me). Back to the important part everyone...the food. They were greatly overpriced...well my first thought was okay priced high food must be great!...hmmm if satisfaction is guaranteed, well they need to give a bunch of refunds. \n\nThe burgers my friend got, looked dry and zero character. It looked like the super mondo burger from Goodburger..you know that dry fake looking one. Obviously the burger wasn\'t that huge, but it looked lame. The pork chop was also VERY dry. Like yeah, i know we are in arizona and most things are dry, but leave the food out of it. It is as if they squeezed the juices out of it. Even with some bbq sauce eating it was nearly impossible. I got the prime rib. OH YEAH! well thats what i thought. Horse radish was old, lost its pizzazz and kick. They definitely cut the prime rib too early after it was cooked because the juices were gone.. and ontop of that i am pretty sure it was sitting under a heat lamp for awhile too (warm but not hot.. booo). Not sure how everyone elses food was, but from viewing it i was less than impressed... Oh and talk about cheap...you can\'t get the normal sides for steak with out paying extra money. The sides they supply you with is half a corn on the cob, and a skimpy helping of green beans.\n\nAnd just to pour a little salt on their already bad yelp from me.. Their cinnamon butter was a sad excuse.. I\'ve had SOO much better before. It was lacking in all areas of its life.\n\n\nWant to know where you can go and get better food, same ambiance, and decent service (but no view of phx)...Texas Roadhouse...yeah i said it..i am bringing a chain into the discussion.. I would hands down go to TRH any day instead of here.\n\nEnd of the line 1 star because the food was blech! 1/2 a star for the view and 1/2 star for good service...yup two stars...(to get that view just drive to the top of the hill and look out soo maybe i should take away one..

The following review is based on the group meal we had in which I brought my 1yr old daughter.\n\n-First of all, not matter what the reviews say, this restaurant is best for large groups or family gatherings.  It is quite loud and I would find it difficult to have an intimate dinner.  However, it is perfect for family and kids and should warrant a visit if you are vacationing with family/friends.  \n\n-For the kids they have a live steer as you are walking in (just warrants a quick look), a slide (kids absolutely love it) and some old fashioned video games.  \n\n-For the adults there is a dance floor with live country music, and REALLY GOOD FOOD!  Everyone in our party loved their food, even the vegetarian (I know how cruel can we be to bring a vegetarian to a BBQ joint).  I shared one of those GIGANTIC meals for 2 or more with a friend, and each item (ribs, chicken, shrimp, etc) was somehow falling off the bone with amazing flavor.\n\n-The only compliant I had was the service was a little off the longer we stayed.  When we first got there the service was amazing, someone stopped by our table every 5-10 minutes.  But after a couple hours of eating and drinking the server couldn't be found.\n\n-Overall, if you are visting the Tempe area for a couple days (like going to Spring Training) with a group of friends or family, you really should try it out you will not be disappointed.", 'business_id': 'wZwZcte4lcbu51NOzCjWbQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2012-03-13', 'type': 'review'}

Overall, the experience is good but nothing to write home about.\n\nOne of my recent visits was on New Year's Eve. I made a reservation ahead of time and the process was perfect. They said upon arrival, if there is a wait for tables we will be bumped to the top of the list. When we arrived, the hosting staff said it was going to be a 30 minute wait. I was a little confused but no point in causing a fuss because we didn't have a strict time schedule for the evening. We walked over to the outside patio to check on the view. Within 5 minutes our buzzer went off and we were seated. Our server was fantastic and friendly. The food was delicious with LARGE portions. And surprisingly not as expensive as i thought it would be.\n\nMy next visit was about a week ago on a Saturday night. We forgot to make a reservation so when we arrived we found out it was going to be an hour wait. We waited maybe 30 minutes before we were seated. Our server, however, was not as wonderful as our visit before. It took 20 minutes to get waters and she kept blaming the bus boys for everything. The food this time was OK. My dad's prime rib came out cold, like it was straight from the fridge. All the side dishes were cold or overcooked. It was a less than stellar experience this time around. If I hadn't been here before, I certainly would not return.\n\nIf you want to give it a shot, I'd say go for it but don't expect the best meal you've ever had.

Sounds like a great plan right!\n\nMom came into town, I told her my plan of taking her out to eat, so Sunday came and we are ready to go!  Oh let me give you guys a little insight too, my mom had a stroke when she was in her 30's so walking is hard for her. \n\nWe got to Rustler's Rooste around 4:25, I never bothered to looked at what times the place was opened, but found out they didn't open till 5, I dropped mom off at valet parking, and they were sweet and showed mom in through the exit so she didn't have to walk the steps. So when I parked the car, the valet told me where my mom went, for a slow walker, she sure did disappear fast , now it's about 4:35, one of the servers saw my mom and told her that when the place opens at 5 someone will seat us by the window if that would be ok with her, it was close to the exit and she was ok with that.\n\nWell 5pm came and nothing was happening, so I went up to the stairs and found the hostess and explained that my mom was handicapped and unable to walk up the stairs and where we were told we could wait to be seated, she said did you have reservations? I said no, again didn't think ahead, maybe I should I have, she said well, I have people upstairs that have been waiting for tables and left.   Walked back to mom and told her I didn't get very far.    From my impression from the hostess, only way I was going to get a table was if I walked upstairs to get it for us, and this left me with a bad impression, that maybe the RR isn't handicap friendly. Like only those who can get up the stairs can have tables, hurray for the walking!   My mom, who is more even tempered then me and is ok with just waiting, said just be still, so I waited. Another lady showed up about 6 mins later and asked if we had be helped and I said no we haven't, and she must have been someone important cuz she made it happened.   \n\nWe were showed to our table, our waitress was Jennifer, very nice and very sweet, she explained the menu to us, since it was both our 1st time there we ordered the Cowboy Stuff, which was bbq ribs & chicken, crispy shrimp, steak & seafood kabobs, beans, veggies, potatoes wedges and some other stuff, I have to say the one thing that stood out was the ribs, omg they are fall off the bone melt in your mouth good! RR knows how to make some ribs!

Checking in with the hostess has always been an issue and it was no different this time around.  It was about a 30 minute wait for a table and a bit unorganized to get your name in with the waitress.  \n\nIf you can get a table along the windows, you will get a fantastic view of the valley, sunset and the air traffic into Sky Harbor.

This is not your new country music. You will get your Johnny, Willie and Waylan which is the way I like it.\n\nDecent menu with options for the kids.  I ordered the 16 oz. Prime Rib (Marshall), medium rare.  The meal comes with bread/butter before hand.  Family style salad and cowboy beans as the first course.  And corn on the cob & green beans with the entree.  The prime rib was every bit of 16 oz, but it was over cooked.  More toward medium than MR.  That was disappointing, especially since 1/4 of the front page of the menu was taken up describing how they cook their meat.\n\nThe sides were OK.  I think they are making a mistake by serving the meal on a plate with a metal cover.  Condensation builds up on the inside of the lid and drips onto to the entree.  It just make everything soggy.\n\nThe service was good, although I had so many plates at my smallish table, that i ran out of room to put things.

It was HORRIBLE! First, you can\'t miss the smell as you walk up to the place. I realized this is because of the Texas Longhorn right in front. Nothing like the smell of excrement and urine right before dinner. Second, the NOISE! This is a country western themed steakhouse, so whatever, be warned. Third, the service was the worst. Since we had a party of 8, an 18% gratuity is automatically added to our bill. That\'s fine, I get it, but apparently our waitress felt she didn\'t have to work for it since it\'s mandatory. She was rude and not very helpful...at all. I never experienced ordering a $20 appetizer (the fried rattlesnake) and having it thrown on our table, she didn\'t even stop! I was also looking forward to finishing our biscuits and fry bread, but apparently there\'s a time limit. She took them away without even asking. Fourth, the food was mediocre, at best. I ordered the 16oz T-Bone and it was under seasoned and not very good. The green bean and corn on the cob sides were soggy. At least try to hide the fact that it was over cooked and soaking in hot water before it was served. Fifth, when it came time to pay the bill, we were given the right check, but our credit card was charged for another party\'s dinner! Really???? We over-paid for a terrible experience! Finally, the General Manager wasn\'t very interested in our experience as paying customers, he said "it happens". SPEECHLESS!

Server was friendly and food came out pretty quick. I had ribs and steak medallions. Flavor of the ribs was spot on but the cut was awful. A lot of gristle and fat. Steak was incredible. I was disappointed with the sides though. They didn't really give you any options. You get whatever they roll out like it or not. Anything extra and you have to pay. Kid had a burger (a $16 burger!) and it was good. Pricey but good. Wife had fried chicken. It was also pretty good. For dessert we had the cow pie which is ice cream under a chocolate shell. This thing was so frozen solid that we needed to break it apart with a knife to eat it! It was way to big of a dessert! No way a small party could eat it all. We didn't even get halfway through it.

It\'s funny that I went back and read my last review and I was surprised to see that I had ordered a filet again. I guess I must be a creature of habit. My tastes have not changed, but the service and quality of RR sure has.\nLet me start off saying that I made reservations weeks in advance. I reserved a booth like last time, and wanted this to be a special Saturday Night Mother\'s Day Dinner! Things just did not pan out that way. As we drove up there were no more handicap parking spots available. I asked the valet if there were anymore, and he said, "This is a busy place at 6pm and obviously there are a lot of retired individuals here". Well I\'m not retired, but my Mother was planning on having us park in a handicap space. No biggie handed the keys to the valet. We were sat right away at a small table downstairs at the far East end. We had a nice view of the city, as well as being right next to the wait station. The evening went downhill from here.\nWe ordered a shrimp cocktail, and some deep fired mushrooms & zucchini. They were very good, came out hot and the shrimp were large and tasty. We ordered Iced Teas & water and our server had a tough time refilling them throughout the night. Even when we would ask for refills ahead of time we had to wait. The salad was terrible! The lettuce was wilted with too much dressing. It tasted like it had been premade and holding somewhere waiting for the busy dinner push. My wife had a nice burger with onion rings and it was the best meal by far. Everything was hot and there was a lot of food. But one would expect that with a $14 burger. My Mother-In-Law had the ribs and she said they were done well and very tender. My Mother & I ordered the filet and I must say that it was plain, tasteless, and not worth it at all. It looked like it had been cooked and held in au jus or a steam well, and possibly microwaved to a hot temperature. I ordered mine medium and it was gray all the way through. I took one bite and was done. My server never asked how my steak was, or why I had not touched it or my beans and corn. When we were getting our plates cleared I asked if my meal could be taken off the bill and that I was not interested in anything else. He returned and said that the manager took my meal off our bill. My Mother on the other hand ate more than a few bites and hers was not taken off the bill. We did not order dessert and when outside to watch the sunset. I had made our reservations for 6pm so we could be outside by 7:19pm for the sunset. The views were awesome as always. It was unfortunate that there was a private party taking up over 75% of the patio, including the prime locations on the Westside where I enjoyed the fire-pits on our last visit. \nI do have to commend Tom Mills for getting back in touch with me. As I mentioned I\'ve been a GM for some time, and I don\'t believe that 20% off was enough to entice me to go back. This is place that you take out of town guests to experience something special in Phoenix. I live in Ahwatukee and love to try and support local businesses\'. Rustler\'s Rooste did ask to follow me on Instagram and inquired if they could post a picture of my Mother and I on the patio with the wonderful view in the background. This is my reply to Tom, I never heard back from him.\n\nTom,\nFirst off I would like to thank you for getting back to me. I did follow Rustler\'s Rooste on Twitter for a bit, I even tweeted about how excited I was to take my family there. But all and all it was not a good experience. \nI pretty sure that Brain asked my dinner companions how their food was, not sure if he addressed me, pretty sure he did not. Obviously it doesn\'t take a mental giant to figure out that I did not touch my plate. \nThe overall experience was lackluster at best. The food to me resembled something like a public school cafeteria meal. Like I had mentioned the salad was awful, and the green beans had been holding somewhere for a long time. \nI appreciate you extending an email to me. I am well aware of guest first service; every guest is my guest, want for nothing service, secret shoppers, and whatever Rustler\'s Rooste 10 Commandments are for steps of service. I have been a local restaurant general manager for years. You are welcome to look me up on LinkedIn. \nThanks again for reaching out to me. I can honestly say that I don\'t think that I will take you up on your offer. I appreciate it and will save your email. Like I have previously mentioned I have been going to Rustler\'s Rooste since I was a bartender at Bobby McGee\'s in the late \'80s.

The guys in the band do a great job interacting with the kids and really made their night by giving my niece their autograph. \nThe reason for 4 stars this visit is because I think the food has gone down a little since our last visit although the beef ribs were  still good.

I was very excited to take him to the restaurant for that purpose and it would be my first visit there. It will also be my last.\nWhen I arrived, a dead fly was on the salad plates that are on the table. When I told the waiter, he seemed rather unphased by the occurrence. I also asked that he provide straws for the water. After being away for some time, he arrived with our drinks and a small kids cup that held the straws. When I picked up the cup, I looked inside to find it was coated with what appeared to be paint chippings and dirt. It was like he grabbed the cup from the back of a dense closet. \nOur food arrived, but was left by the cook and we waited for our waiter bit to arrive and serve. I ordered the swordfish and it was very chewy. The steak was okay, certainly not worth the price. My boyfriend had the chicken- he was pleased with the barbeque, but the green beans were cold. The cowboy beans provided tasted like ketchup and pepper, absolutely horrible. \nI never received a refill, but our waiter was hard to find. He was pretty clueless. I think that reflects more on the restaurant than his skill sets. \nWhen we left it was a relief.

Friendly staff, just clueless on policies and pleasing the customer.\nCons- very confusing!!! You get a different answer to every question depending on who you ask but then it always comes back to no, we cant do that. Food was bad, nothing I would expect at a steakhouse. Both steaks were overcooked!\n\nWe went there on a Thursday night as a treat to ourselves. Hadn\'t been there in years. We had our 2 yo with us since it was kids eat free, we thought it would be kid friendly. Saw that hh is only offered in the saloon upstairs so we decided to have a drink and app before going down to eat. The hostess let us know we could sit at any of the low top tables w/o a reserved sign or any hightop table. We chose a low top by the window because of our child. We sat there for awhile wondering if we had to go to the bar ourselves. Finally a lady comes up to us and says she was sorry and nobody wanted to come tell us but the table we were at was actually reserved. I guess if they have a red napkin it means reserved, the hostess was not aware either. So we ask where else we can sit. She says any of the high tops or at the bar. So I ask again to confirm that there is not a single low top table we can sit at with our 2yo?!? So since they can\'t accommodate us, we ask if we can get hh downstairs, no. They cannot do that, but we can grab our own drinks now and take them down with us, fine. So we get our drinks and take them to the table. Great view!! Skip ahead to ordering. Be prepared to pay extra if you are a meat and potatoes lover. All dinners are served with green beans and a tiny corn on the cob. Both were gross! Table gets a dish of cowboy beans that look and taste like they are just a few beans mixed into tomato sauce. My husband did not eat them and thats saying a lot!! A side of any type of potato is an extra $2-5 and hopefully everyone at the table agrees on one because they are huge sides. He ordered his prime rib med-rare and I order the filet med- well. When they showed up, I would have ate his steak! Both were overcooked. Mine had no pink at all but thats fine to me but his was so tough looking for a prime rib and had a sliver of pink only in the middle. In any other moment he would have sent it back but since at this point it was such a bad experience, all we could do was laugh and so he sucked it up and ate it. To top it off, the waiter tried to sneak one by us and charge us for the child meal. When we pointed it out he says," oh oops I gave you the old copy". Ya ok.

Most enjoy their first time but wouldn't prefer to go again.  Firstly, you walk up to a stinky cow at the entrance... Not a great way to kick start an appetite if you ask me.  After holding my breath and being led to our table, there is a slide you can take down instead of a short flight off stairs.  So bring out the inner kid by sliding down (and later finishing with some free cotton candy dessert).  The view is pretty spectacular and we had the pleasure of dining come sunset.  Our pictures looked like they were already instagrammed with the way the lighting hit.  The food- worst free bread I think I've ever had, no fluffiness, no texture, hard and cold.  The rattlesnake was super chewy and honestly you get more crunchy fried batter than snake in each bite.  The presentation is awesome with the rib cage for sure.  I'm just wondering if they have someone out on then hill hunting them or what?  Definitely the closest I'd ever get to a snake by choice.  Anyways, I had the prime rib special which was pretty delicious and average.  The mashed potatoes and the jalape\xf1o Mac and cheese though were definitely something to write about.  The Mac n cheese was a perfect balance of crunchiness and a little kick without being too cheesy or liquidy.  If you decide to order mushrooms on your steak, it's a huge portion so I'd recommend sharing one order amongst the group.  Finally, the cotton candy... Such melt in your mouth goodness.  It didn't melt or stick to your hands and it's spun perfectly so you can actually tear off layers.

From there, you can look down at the stage, dance floor and tons of families eating with kids having fun taking turns going down the slide adjacent to the stairs. Even some young-at-heart adults were using it. Once seated, we admired our fairly scenic view from atop the Arizona Grand.\n\nThe menu that night displayed several sizes of prime rib, a New York steak, several seafood options and a turkey dinner. Three of us opted for the New York steak and my future mother-in-law had the turkey. I enjoyed the flavor of the medium rare cut, albeit chewier than I like. A dab of A1 sauce was a nice complement, or even the sauce from the Cowboy beans given to us to share. The turkey plate was the most attractive of all incorporating your usual Thanksgiving fare.\n\nThough I'm used to a Christmas dinner hosted at home, Rustler's Roost was a highly suitable alternative that could become a family tradition.", 'business_id': 'wZwZcte4lcbu51NOzCjWbQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2013-12-26', 'type': 'review'}

Rustlers Rooste was a huge disappointment compared to the past visits.  We waited 45 minutes for a table when sitting in the bar and saw no less than 8 tables empty for 20 minutes and not being bused. They were intentionally making people wait to make the place seem busier.  When i checked on our table the hostess checked the time we arrived then her clock and told me we had 15 minutes more to wait.  She never once looked at how many were in front of us making it clear there was a prescribed wait time and it didnt have anything to do with how busy they were. From our point in the bar we watched in amazement as one of the hostess staff kept pulling a burger and fries from a cupboard to eat while people were waiting to be seated! The fry bread and salad came quickly but then it took forever to get our meals we had to ask twice for a second drink.  When our food did finally come it was just okay.  The burger looked the best but the ribs one of our party ordered was disappointing and the "steak" fries were really only one potato cut in four wedges and deep fried - they were just terrible.  And did I mention the forced cheerful cowboy ya\'ll of our server?  It was clearly faked and odd.\n\nThe view is great and the place is fun for kids under 10.

There was what looked like a hostess stand right there, but the young woman assigned there was not only clueless but she made zero attempt to be helpful. Initially telling us we had to go back outside & proceed upstairs to the main hostess. I said we\'d entered via the marked handicap entrance intentionally but she looked at us with oblivion. I then explained we were with a large group that was sitting outside with picnic tables & without asking which group, pointed ahead & said to keep going "past the slide" & we\'d come to a doorway where a host could show us the way. We walked through a maze which included a dance floor & found no one, but we proceeded outside to where we saw groups. Eventually, a nice waiter was gracious enough to look up our group name & show us to our groups very nice private dining area. Once we arrived, we learned there had been at least 2 more direct and far closer routes. \nThe area our group had was really very nice. We had our own fire pit which was lit & of course the famous view of the entire Phoenix area. It was a really nice evening to be outside. \nThe food was set up in our own buffet & is served in cowboy style metal pie pans. The food was average, but portions were quite generous, with everyone getting a full half of chicken, beans, corn, salad & biscuits. They even brought more fresh, warm biscuits to our table. There was also large slices of what was probably the worse apple pie I\'ve ever tasted on a separate buffet. \nOne of our guests learned that folks sitting inside got free cotton candy, so she got that ball rolling--a fun addition. \nWould I go back on a return to Phoenix?

There is a pretty sweet slide that takes you down into the main dining area, live music in the evening, and beautiful views of the valley. So, the ambiance is fun.\n\nNegatives: In my opinion, the food is NOT worth the price. First of all, you have to pay extra for sides like baked potato. This kind of a side is typically included at most steakhouses. They do serve bread which is super yummy. However,  the salad is a bagged salad,  not at all fresh and tastes horrible. I ordered the prime rib, I liked the seasoning but it was not medium rare as ordered. Like my vegetables, it was overcooked.  The veggies were not fresh and again, overcooked. When you pay$20 for a plate, you expect much more. Our waitress was inattentive and disappeared for a significant amount of time. There is a magician that comes around to the tables which I find annoying and uncomfortable.  I never carry cash, so I just sat there hoping he would skip us which he did.  As he passed by I got a huge whiff of cologne...nothing goes together like Old Spice and steak.  \n\nI will say that my son enjoyed the fried chicken and my husband liked his enchilada and steak plate.  However,  we could have had better food for less at Outback. Bottom Line: you are paying for the experience, not the food. Fun to do once, but $75 was a hefty price tag for subpar food.

Would love to have seen it during the daylight as well.  And it\'s big! As soon as you get to the entrance you\'re greeted by a longhorn steer named Horney.  When you enter you climb your way into the restaurant through a wooden path that looks like an old mine.  Think amusement park ride.  Then when you get in it is BUSY! People everywhere. Floors are uneven. Loud, live music.  It would have been a 45 minute wait so I opted for a seat at the bar.  However, the woman who sat me didn\'t explain that if you sit at the bar you can only order appetizers. Well she was in luck because that\'s all I wanted, but it would have been nice to know that was my option!\n\nI came for the rattlesnake bites and cactus fries, but ended up also ordering some wings because you only get about an ounce of meat with the rattlesnake bites.  The bartender, though busy, did find the time to take my order and tried to accommodate me. Looking around at the sea of bodies, I completely understood why he wasn\'t super attentive.  The food was ok. I just wanted to add another unique food to my list.  The rattlesnake was heavily breaded, chewy and kind of like chicken. Not much meat in those bites, though. The accompanying sauce...ick.  There were plenty of cactus fries and they reminded me of fried pickles.  The wings were delicious!  So glad I got those because I wasn\'t a big fan of the fries after the first few bites.  \n\nIf I make it back to Phoenix, I might give it another go (but will try a steak or something else).

(for the faint of heart, there\'s a staircase).   Enjoy the live country western band and our strolling cardshark/magician.  The building is bordered on the north side by plate glass windows so there is a view form every seat in the house. Rustler\'s Rooste was founded in 1971 and is still family owned and operated.  The legend goes that the original site, atop a butte in the foothills of South Mountain, was a hideout for cattle rustlers.

It's a corny, western-themed place to take out-of-towners who haven't been to the Southwest.  They do the gimmick thing well, and it is what it is.  If you want an absolutely delicious meal in a pleasant environment, go elsewhere, but if you want somewhere silly to take a family member as a funny 'intro' to Arizona, this will work.\n\nI'm definitely NOT knocking the gimmick thing.  It has it's place and is great for a laugh.  That's where the two stars come from, because they know what they are and you get exactly what you'd expect: mediocre food at a high price while surrounded by heavily-themed EVERYTHING.\n\nAs a foodie, though, I do have to knock the prices and food quality separately from the 'gimmick' side of this place.  It's not bad food, but it definitely isn't great either.  Very mediocre.  On the plus side, my steak was cooked perfectly (med. rare) which I always appreciate, but that's about the only thing that stood out as positive.  The salad was way too heavy on the dressing and the biscuits in the bread basket tasted like canned biscuits.  The real downside to this is the pricing...very expensive! It helps to think of it as you're paying for the gimmick experience and the great view, not just the food.  I've heard their cocktails and margaritas are good, so that's a plus.\n\nOverall, come here once when you want to bring out-of-towners, but don't plan on it becoming a regular favorite.

I was worried, to say the least.  The reviews I saw were terrible.  My parents, my son and I went together at about 5:30 pm on a Monday night.  Here are the points:\n1. Our waitress was attentive and very adorable.\n2. We enjoyed seeing the longhorn at the front door.  He was lying down, so his odor was at a minimum.\n3. The "mine" entrance was fun, and my 14 yo had just toured a mine the day before, so that made it more interesting to us.\n4. My son wouldn\'t go down the slide, but my dad and I both slid into the restaurant.  The little kids sliding there were adorable.\n5. The upstairs bar area looked nice, and had a better view, so next time I might opt to stay upstairs and just go for the appetizer menu if that\'s what they serve there.\n6. We were seated quickly at a window seat down stairs by the patio.  The view is good.  We could see Camelback Mountain.  The view upstairs would be a lot better, in my opinion.\n7. There were a lot of small children.  A lot.  But they were well behaved and it didn\'t get too noisy.  Some have complained about the noise, but being early on Monday, the place wasn\'t full\n8. The live band was good and where we were seated it wasn\'t too loud for talking to each other.\nOverall, we enjoyed the Wild West theme.  It isn\'t too overwhelming if you are ready for it.  The view and the theme are the reasons to go to this place.\n\nNow for the food.  Remember that this place is more about atmosphere, and less about the food.  And the food is meant to be simple cowboy food, not gourmet.  It was good for me to start with very low expectations.\n1. We were served a bowl of bread.  The Indian Fry Bread was really pleasant.  I would like to learn to make those little breads.  The biscuit was not good.  It was dry and hard.  I ate mine.  It was a waste of space in my stomach.  I recommend skipping the biscuit.\n2. A family bowl of salad came next.  It is pre-tossed with ranch dressing.  The salad was fine.  It is like a standard iceberg/red cabbage mix.  We thought it had just the right amount of dressing tossed on.  It was not drenched in dressing.  Thank goodness.  After all the terrible reviews I had meant to ask for the dressing on the side, but forgot.\n2. I ordered the Big Burger  It was definitely good.  I ordered medium-rare and it as perfectly cooked, and was large and juicy.  It came with fries and onion rings.  I love onion rings, and I felt the onion rings at the Rooste were very good.  The french fries on the other hand, were just OK.  I didn\'t finish them because they were not really crispy.   \n3. My Dad ordered the veggie burger.  It was just OK.  Unless you are a vegetarian, don\'t get this.  It was more expensive than our delicious real beef burger.  He said the vegetarian chili was good.\n4. My Mom ordered a steak and vegetables.  Her steak was medium-rare just as she ordered.  It was big and juicy.  She loved it.   Very good.  Her vegetables were steamed, not seasoned, but she said they were good.  The corn on the cob was good.  Not over-cooked.\nI wanted to order dessert, but was too full.\n\nI doesn\'t get a four or five star because the food is western, which to me is rather plain.  There was nothing outstanding or exotic about the food.  Plus it was a little expensive.  $14.95 seems like a lot to pay for a burger.  Although, it was huge and came with a lot of bread and salad...\n\nOverall we had a great experience.  When we left there was a cowboy roping metal calves on the patio, and the band was singing pleasant country music.  I would definitely go back.', 'business_id': 'wZwZcte4lcbu51NOzCjWbQ', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2014-06-23', 'type': 'review'}

It took forever for the food to arrive. They brought out some salad and Indian fry bread and biscuits while we waited. They topping for the breads were margarine or cinnamon margarine.

The sirloin was ordered medium well but it was cooked to the point if being leathery. The enchiladas might have been "ok" (not good) but were sitting on too of a plate full of baked beans, as were the corn on the cob and steak. All the flavors congealed into each other. Yuck!\n\nThe filet mignon was also cooked until they were sure it was dead, really dead! They insisted there was pink in it but we couldn\'t see it. They offered to being us each another steak but since it took 30 minutes to get the first one, we were done. \n\nThey did bring free apple pie with ice cream to make it up to us.

She chose RR because she saw that they had the slide.  I called to see if they would accept a reservation and the only opening they had was at 8:30PM or show up with a 45 minute wait.  I decided to go ahead and show up and wait and hoping it wouldn't be that long.  When we drove up, I thought it was going to be a very long wait as the main parking lot was full and we had to drive to the additional parking.  When we walked up to the hostess desk a little after 7PM, they said it would be a 30 minute wait.  We decided to check out the place and my daughter wanted to do the slide.  She pretty much just went up and down on the slide until our buzzer rang, which was less than 30 minutes.  We got a table right by the windows, so it was a nice view.  It seemed like a bit before someone came with water and even longer before we saw our waitress.   \n\nI ordered the bbq chicken and my daughter ordered the spaghetti.  As we waited, they provided a nice hot basket of fried bread and biscuits.  The fried bread was good with honey, but not the usual fry bread I'm accustomed to since it was doughier.  My daughter liked the fry bread (because of the honey), the biscuit not so much.  One of the two balloon artists came by and she got a flower as we waited.\n\nOur dinner didn't seem to take too long to make despite it being very busy.  They first brought out the salad, which had a ranch dressing.  Soon afterwards, our dinners came.  The kid's spaghetti came with two garlic bread pieces and a lot of spaghetti.  My bbq chicken came with steamed veggies, corn, and beans.  As far as the food, my daughter said that we make better spaghetti at home.  My chicken was dry and the bbq sauce was ok.  On the bright said, my daughter really liked the corn.  The veggies had way too much pepper.  The beans had some spice to them, but were just okay.  We had plenty of leftovers to take home.  The best part of dinner was yet to come though.  When they brought out the cotton candy, my daughter gobbled it up.  I had a few bites and I must say, the cotton candy tasted very fresh and probably was the best cotton candy I've had.  It had a very nice bubble gum favor.  My daughter probably could have gobbled up another one.\n\nWhen we got the bill, I was pleasantly surprised.  RR must have a special where you buy an adult entr\xe9e and you get a kids meal free.  Not sure if that is an offer they have all the time or just certain days.\n\nDid I mention this is a very family friendly place?  There were a lot of families and kids at RR on Saturday.  The line at times for the slide was long.  My daughter enjoyed going on the slide so much before dinner that I let her go on the slide again after dinner.  She did this for about 20 minutes and before I told her it was time to go.  She probably could have slid on it for another 30 minutes if I let her.\n\nOverall, I would give the RR two stars for the food and one additional star for the ambience.  The most memorable part of the evening for my daughter was the slide and the cotton candy, which I would agree.", 'business_id': 'wZwZcte4lcbu51NOzCjWbQ', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2014-07-02', 'type': 'review'}

It was an occasion that conjured up the entire waitstaff, as they clapped their hands (and probably rolled their eyes), sang happy birthday, and delivered me a massive dessert adorned by a tiny glowing birthday candle. \n\nMy twins just turned 5 and I wanted them to also have that delightful moment of abundant attention and sugar.  So, I started to look for places that would sing happy birthday.  Apparently, this is yet another thing to file in the "good old days" category.  Supposedly My Big Fat Greek Restaurant sings happy birthday in Greek...which sounds interesting, unless you are a 5 year old.\n\nRustler\'s Rooste was suggested and it is true - they do sing happy birthday!  However, for a $15 price  tag.  \n\nBut!  You also get a cowboy hat.\n\nI have to give them props for keeping the birthday spirit alive and well, even if it is no longer free.  The candle-lit dessert that arrives is enough to feed 3-4 people.  It is a football-sized eclair, oozing with whipped cream (my favorite food), and drizzled with chocolate (my second favorite food).\n\nAs for the rest of the food....it is okay.  The meal starts with complimentary bread and butter and salad (ice berg lettuce, cucumber, a few cherry tomatoes and croutons).  I do appreciate getting food immediately, even if it is mostly iceberg lettuce and chewy bread.\n\nFor the meal, I had the "catch of the day" which was ahi tuna.  It was well seasoned, but it could have been more pink.  I will say the exact same thing about my husband\'s steak.  The kids-meal portion of macaroni & cheese was terrifyingly huge; I think it was the largest portion size among the entire table.  I was relieved I opted to get steamed broccoli instead of french fries that came on the side.  \n\nBut this may just not be the place you go for a fine-dining experience.  It is a place you go for a fun-dining experience.  There is a slide that all the kids love...and maybe some adults (*cough*) enjoy it as well.  There is also a big cow  that greets you at the entrance.  Does it emit a smell that I want to smell right before eating? \n\nProbably not.

We were there to celebrate our 11th wedding anniversary and our visit there was our first experience at the establishment.\n\nWe ordered the big cowboy dinner platter that came with many different options from the menu. Our fried shrimp were burned, the ribs were the same way. The fish kabobs were raw and the beans were cold. The coleslaw, the fresh vegetables and the dipping sauces were warm as if they\'d sat under a heat lamp the whole time the rest of the food was being cooked. All of this food was served on a bunch of warm, wilted lettuce that made the dish look unappealing to even eat.\n\nOur waitress did an ok job. She was busy as it seemed like she was attending to too many tables so it took long periods of time to get to us. Not her fault. We should have said something last night but our waitress was so busy that she didn\'t have time to come over to ask about our meal so we asked for the check and left. \n\nHaving spent $22 per person on this meal we expected much much more. Yes, the view of the valley was great but the meal and the service received a failing grade from us. \n\nI submitted feedback to the restaurant through their website last night and received a call this morning from the manager. I was impressed that he called me back so quickly. He asked if we would give the place another chance so that they could make it up to us and offered us a VIP experience AT A DISCOUNT.  I called my wife and asked her if she would be willing to go back to which she replied "No Way". I asked the manager for a refund instead of the opportunity to return and his response was that they do not offer refunds. I appreciate his attempt to make things "right" with a discounted meal if we were to come back but pretty sad that they aren\'t willing to make things right with a refund. \n\nI hadn\'t planned on writing this review until after speaking with the manager and hearing that they do not offer refunds for a horrible experience and that he wanted to have us back for a DISCOUNT, not a complimentary meal.

Sadly, it\'s a shadow of its former self. Sure, the place still has terrific views but that\'s it.  The tables and chairs are rickety and aren\'t cleaned often, as using my hand to pull my own chair in found at least two used pieces of gum affixed to the underside.  \n\nMy wife and I quickly ordered macaroni and cheese for our two year old son while we looked over our menu options.  The mac and cheese arrived within two minutes - clearly it\'s made en masse - but was overcooked and lacked any discernible flavor.  This should have been all the warning we needed, but instead we forged ahead and ordered the "Cowboy Stuff" platter for two.  At $21.95 per person it seemed like a good value for all it promised; BBQ chicken and ribs, skewers of beef, chicken, and seafood, baked potatoes, corn, the works.  What was delivered was a baking sheet with all the aforementioned food loaded onto it, but with whole carrots with the green stems still on, celery stalks with leaves on it, and so on.  It looked like someone had been foraging in the woods for our dinner.   It was accompanied by a very forgettable salad that had tons of dressing, yet lacked flavor of any kind.  \n\nThen came the taste test of our main course.  The name of this restaurant really should be "Overcooked and Flavorless" because the trend started with our son\'s unfortunate kid\'s meal was consistent across the entire meal.  \n\nMy son needed to use the restroom, so we headed off in that direction.  The baby changing station isn\'t even in the bathroom, but affixed to a wall out in the hall for all to see.  Walking into the bathroom, we took one look at the dirty, dank surroundings and immediately headed the other direction.  We\'ll wait, thanks.  \n\nGetting back to the table and trying my food, I decided to ask for the manager to voice my concerns.  Unbeknownst to me, my wife had already spoken with him.  When he arrived, he seemed exasperated and told me, "I already told her I\'d replace the meal with something else and she said no.  What else do you want?"   Um, well NOTHING now, pal.

The place is noisy\nlots of movement, bands, a wedding party, kids on the slide. Cotton Candy flowing out of tin cans. Just a good light hearted night out with the family. \nServing sizes were good, price was moderate. Menu had something for everyone. Family style servings too if that\'s your thing.

We learned most of what we needed to know by eavesdropping on a competent one at the table beside us. Then our food began to arrive. The buns were good, the salad mediocre and the "grill mix" so bad we barely ate any. The tenderloin was not tenderloin at all, the ribs were a strange red colour and smothered in a barbque sauce that returned to us over and over all night long and the swordfish scared me so badly I chose not to eat more than the first taste. We also had a side of mashed potatoes that were gritty and watery. On top of everything else, all the food  was so highly salted, we thought it should be declared a deadly weapon.

She didn\'t understand how I could be lost and had no idea houses were right below them. \n\nAfter a few minutes of searching, I located the place. The parking lot was packed (it was Saturday night) but there was a nice gentleman there with a shuttle to help us to the top of the hill. \n\nThe restaurant itself is pretty rustic. There\'s a huge long horn steer outside, so the smell was a little strong but manageable. Inside was a live band and unique designed layout with a kid slide and all. \n\nWe had a nice window seat which overlooked the city lights. The view was great and so was the friendly staff. The issue I had the most was with the food. \n\nI was not impressed to say the least. We ordered the "Cowboy Stuff" which was basically a sample of ribs, chicken, fish, shrimp and filet mignon. The sides were potato wedges, spicy baked beans, pineapple coleslaw , corn on the cob and a side of veggies. The meal also came with rolls, biscuits and a salad. Overall cost was $47 and with a tip, about $55 total for the two of us. \n\nEverything was pretty bland and nothing that stood out as great tasting. I would much rather have gone to Pork on the Fork, a local BBQ place two minutes from my house. Instead I drove 40 minutes across the valley for this? Very disappointing to me. \n\nIf it wasn\'t for the cool atmosphere and helpful staff, I would give this place a two star rating.

Every year my family cooks but this year we decided to eat out and try out this restaurant. The thanksgiving dinner special  is $139 feast for 6 to 8 people, a little pricey but we thought hey it must good portions.  We were only 6 adults and a kid. Before getting into details of the experience.  I would like to say I have been in hospitality and have been in restaurant business for 10+ years for major hotels.\nSo our experience begins with a  "reservation" for 7 people at 4 pm. We get there and there is a line out the door. No separate lines for  reservations and for walk ins. They said sorry its not a reservation but priority seating only. We will have to wait for 30 min +. It ended up being an hour!  No really apologies and the hostess were completely disorganized and lacked good service.  There was actually one hostess that was amazing and kept her composer.  I apologize for not getting her name but she had straight hair and I believe she is African American. She deserves to be hired at a fine dinning restaurant.  If she reads this post I hope she applies to a fine dinning place. We get seated and our Server Dale is beat already.  But he was nice and we tried to be positive. He brought us the first course with no utensils.  He apologized and we understood they were busy and I bet the dishwasher was running behind. We order our drinks and a few were alcohol beverages.  He never asked if we wanted more drinks or check on us that frequently.  Again I am a part time server so I kept positive.  The food i do have to say was delicious but the portions were really small. Not sure really worth the price. When my spouse was cutting the turkey he was pushed by a busser. He didn\'t say excuse me. So rude. When my family and I wanted to split the check a certain way he rolled his eyes! We were going to give 20% or even a little more but soon dropped it. Then we asked for foil to cover our leftover pie he just threw it on the table and walked away without asking how was our dinning experience.  We informed the manager/owner Karen I believe and she seemed genuine but only said sorry and next time just ask for her and she would make sure we would have a different experience.  I live in California. I highly doubt I will ever come and if I have friends who visit Phoenix area I would never suggest this place.  I would probably warn them.

It would have been awesome if we could have sat on the patio all night but there was private party down there.. Darn. The people looked to be having a great time down there and it was decorated festively and the grub was looking good :)\nThe way the tables are arranged inside allows everyone to have a wonderful view and that\'s how it should be. \nOk, the restaurant is a steakhouse so for non meat eaters the selection is sparse but I found cheese enchiladas that are a side dish and you get salad and rolls served family style. We ordered the dressing on the side as others have suggested. \nMy other half splurged on the porterhouse steak (he was dying for!) and when it arrived it was cooked as ordered. No complaints from his side of the table, lol. My side dish was 2 small enchiladas, so if you are a bit more hungry order 3. They were all right . I will try the veggie burger with veg chili next time.\nDessert? Wowsa! I ordered an eclair since it was for my birthday and that guy is HUGE!  We cut into it  for about "small" size servings and still had almost all of it on the plate! Order when you have a large party or eaters. Great part is you can take it home.\nThere is a band that plays at 6 p.m. and they were pretty good  There\'s a small dance floor that some people chose to use.  Mostly Mom\'s and kids and the occasional couple. \nThe music is County and on the mellow side , not too wild, not too loud, so I suspect that\'s to let you enjoy your meal leisurely. \nCotton Candy.. last had this when I was a teen so we both decided to try it and it was better than we thought it would be when it was delivered when we finished our meal. Not sticky sweet like we both remember.

False.  Pick 1.  You can\'t have both.\nBeyond this trickery, the place is pretty cool.  The slide is fun, and it\'s neat to do some dancing by the live band.

Also, I really did not like the tri-tip pieces slathered in red-hot spicy sauce.  The beef tasted like tough chunks of chuck roast, and the sauce tasted like burning.  That\'s it.  It was too spicy to know whether or not it tasted good.  \nThe Philly cheese-steak sandwich and fries were bland.  Once we added salt to the meal, the flavor was dramatically improved.  The sweet potato fries were good (we got the sweet potato fries as an appetizer before we realized the sandwich would come with fries).  \nThere was only one waitress serving the saloon area, so I had to go on several missions to get more water, find salt, and eventually pay my bill.\nThe place is a mixed bag.

Rustler's Rooste was complete with an indoor slide, indoor wall-fountain, performers, amazing city views, a photo-booth, silly cutouts that you can put your face through, and an overall western vibe. Coming into this place, I had great expectations for the food. Sadly, the food wasn't as good as I expected it to be. I ordered the steak, which came with beans and corn. It was alright, but tasted like any other meal. The steak was a bit too chewy, the corn was... well, corn, and the beans were just 'okay'. Something was amiss. Also, it was difficult to have a conversation because it was quite loud. I'm not sure if this was because of the location of the table.  The restaurant didn't have a sit-and-dine kind of atmosphere, but rather a louder, rowdy wild wild west kind of atmosphere (which could be a good thing or a bad thing, depending). \n\nBottom line:\n-I would recommend checking out this restaurant if you want a new experience and a fun atmosphere, especially if you're new to Phoenix or Arizona.

Terrible food, terrible service. \nWe went to the Rooste last September when we were staying at the Grand for my husband\'s birthday and were disappointed from the moment we walked in. We went to the hostess stand and stood there for 3 minutes (I timed it) before one of the four hostesses even looked up to acknowledge us. The girl that helped us acted like she was doing us a favor by allowing us to eat there. It was a busy saturday night, so we had to wait a bit for a table. No problem, because we could grab a drink at the bar and then let our kids go down the slide a few hundred times. \nWe get to the table, order from a very nice but stressed out waitress. After much more endless sitting and waiting, and joking with the table next to us about the ridiculous wait, our food gets dropped off by a food runner. Not dropped off to our table, mind you, but the runner puts the tray of food on a stand nearby, and tells us that our waitress will be by to serve us momentarily. After more waiting, we served ourselves, ate, and put our dirty dishes back on the serving tray before our waitress came around to see us again. Glad we didn\'t wait to be served. The food was airline-quality. We both ordered the steak and enchiladas (a weird combo to offer but it sounded good at the time). I could have easily made something better at home. Maybe the point of having you wait for so long for your food is to make you starving enough to choke it down. \nWe were so over the whole experience by that point that we asked for the manager. What a mistake. Most managers in a customer service setting are cordial to the customers and care about their business. Not this guy. He stormed over to our table and practically yelled that they were very busy that night, and we should be more patient. We hadn\'t even explained our issue by that point. As my husband tried to explain the numerous issues that we had encountered from the rude hostesses down to the nonexistent waitress, the manager seemed to get angry with us and again told us to be more patient. To which my husband replied "Are you f***ing kidding me?" Well, that didn\'t sit well with the manager, who said he wouldn\'t even speak to us further if we were going to cuss at him. I took over and asked us how he would feel if he were in our shoes. How he expects to be treated at a restaurant, and what kind of service he expects when he dines out. He simply said that they were just too busy that night and there was nothing he could do to help us. We weren\'t asking for anything, we were just trying to make him aware of all of the issues that we had encountered so he and his staff could try to improve. \nI\'ve had poor service at other restaurants, but I\'ve never had a restaurant manager act like such a jerk. It\'s no wonder that place has such bad reviews. It\'s terribly run, and the food is terrible. The only thing it has going for it is the slide and the view. \nDon\'t waste your money.', 'business_id': 'wZwZcte4lcbu51NOzCjWbQ', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2015-02-15', 'type': 'review'}

I have heard about many times over the years as it is somewhat of a tourist landmark restaurant but never had the opportunity to try it.  The perfect opportunity arose last night when we had family in town and decided to give it a try.\n\nThis restaurant is situated at the top of a hill at the Arizona Grand Hotel.  The views are incredible and the feel and theme are really fun especially since we are right of the I-10.  It feels like you are in a small cowboy area in the middle of the city.  This is a family friendly place that is actually really good for kids as it is loud and your little ones won't be bothering anyone.  There is music 7 nights a week and it can be very crowded, despite the fact that the restaurant seats at least 500 not including the patio.  We were able to get a reservation as we were a larger group of 10 so that was nice.  The restaurant is very dim and we needed our smartphone flashlights in order to read them.  Thank goodness for technology.\n\nThe menu is what you would expect from a theme steak house.  The usual fare; steaks, chicken and some seafood with the typical side dishes.  I decided on the mixed grill which was very tender filet medallions and you had a choice of another meat and I chose the ribs.  They were also very good and tender.  The side veggie were carrots that were tasty but some were not cooked enough so they were tough.  We also all got cowboy beans (eh) and salad for the table as well as rolls that were kind of yucky.  For dessert, we opted to try the cowpie (how could you not?) which was basically chocolate covered coffee ice cream.  The description definitely sounded better than it tasted but it was ok to satisfy our sweet tooths.  The meals that my family had they enjoyed as well.  \n\nThis is definitely a place that I would come back to.

I selected the location primarily for the view and a solid menu. The website indicated that the restaurant takes reservations but when I called, I was informed that there is a "call ahead" list rather than an actual reservation option. The purpose of the call ahead list is to shorten your wait time.  \n\nI arrived and the restaurant was extremely busy. I was given a buzzer to notify me when our table was ready and told the wait would be 20-30 minutes. I think our wait was around the 30 minute mark.\n\nWhen we were seated, we had a decent view but the restaurant was so amazingly loud, we had to practically scream at each other to be heard during the entire meal. We were competing with what felt/sounded like thousands of other diners who were all doing the same. There were a number of birthdays being celebrated while we were there and for each one the staff would come through with an insanely loud dinner triangle, accompanied by a shouted announcement and singing. It was impossible to have a conversation when this happened.\n\nOur waiter was clearly run ragged. He did what he could to keep up with the drink refils but that\'s about it. Ordering was a chore because he wasn\'t able to hear us over the din. The food was pretty basic. I had the salmon, which was good. My  husband had the ribs, which were good and our guests each had steak. Neither of the steaks were cooked as ordered. \n\nAlong with being loud, the restaurant was very dark and our table lantern was out. We inquired about getting it lit and that took our overworked waiter almost the entire duration of the meal to manage. Once we got it lit, it was still very dark. \n\nMy husband and I had been to Rustler\'s Rooste once before for Easter Brunch and we were pleased with the service and food. Last night, however, was a less than enjoyable experience.', 'business_id': 'wZwZcte4lcbu51NOzCjWbQ', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2015-03-22', 'type': 'review'}

I tried to talk him out of it - but it *was* his birthday, and sometimes, it can be fun to be a hokey tourist in your own town.\nWe had no delusions about what we were in for. This is not a great restaurant. This is a cheesy, cowboy themed resort restaurant that caters to tourists and happens to have a great view. To make sure we did it right, we changed clothes prior to going - to ensure we could enjoy the slide down into the dining room. (Without offending parents of innocent children or risking chafing to dangly bits.)\nWe started with a cocktail in the bar while waiting for a table. Did we each order the sickly-sweet tropical nonsense in a glass cowboy boot and served while on fire? You bet your ass we did! (Now, to figure out what to do with my glass cowboy boot souvenir...)\nThere\'s sawdust on the floor, and the d\xe9cor screams "Disney Design Company." All the clich\xe9s of an old West steakhouse/saloon are represented - down to the raised stage where the live band performs all the safe, upbeat Country standards.\nWhen we were seated, a basket of fry bread was delivered with both regular and honey butter. Do you know what\'s wrong with fried bread and butter? Not a damn thing!\nThis is not a menu for the health conscious. And based on the prices, there\'s no possible way it\'s great quality meat. ($24.95 for a bone in rib-eye - with salad, carrots and corn??) The portions are ginormous, there\'s a decent variety of options, and rotating monthly specials.\nI had discreetly mentioned it was my friend\'s birthday (because I put the "B" in subtle!) I wasn\'t down with spending the extra money for the birthday package...and really, who needs an \xe9clair sundae that must weigh in at five pounds - so we were both pleased when the waiter brought my friend cotton candy with a candle.\nWe went in with expectations of touristy cheesiness and set the bar very, very low for dinner service. And we were both pleasantly surprised. The food was completely satisfactory. The service was completely decent. And when it came down to it - we had an absolute blast.\nRustler\'s Rooste is not a great restaurant by any stretch, and it\'s not trying to be - but it can be great fun if you let it...and that makes it a great place!', 'business_id': 'wZwZcte4lcbu51NOzCjWbQ', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2015-04-01', 'type': 'review'}

They have pretty standard, average food, and lots of gimmicks.  First, the place is huge. It is two stories, and each floor has a bar. Downstairs, they also have a little stage where a live band plays and there's a dance floor. After you are seated, you are given a basket of complimentary fry bread and biscuits, which are pretty delicious. They have lots of choices on the menu, so even the pickiest eater should be able to find something. That being said, there's lots of meat and potato type dishes. You get a family-style premade salad with your meal which is a pretty standard lettuce/tomato/onion/crouton/ranch salad. Ours was cold and the lettuce was crisp so I really liked it.  The portion sizes are pretty generous. We ended up not being able to finish our meals.  We had a couple of cocktails from the bar, and they have alcohol versions of limeade which are pretty delicious and reasonably priced, for alcohol. When you get the check, you will receive a complimentary spool of cotton candy.  The restaurant sits up on a hill, so it has pretty good views of the valley and if you get there at the right time, you'll see a nice sunset.  I wasn't expecting anything truly extraordinary from this place, because I had read the reviews beforehand, but we went, it was packed, we had pretty decent service and decent food so I have no complaints.  If you're expecting a fancy schmancy steakhouse, this is not your place. It is a family-friendly, loud, casual joint which I think a lot of people would get a kick out of.  Oh! Also. If you are staying at the Arizona grand resort, there is a shuttle which will run you up to the restaurant and will pick you up after.

Other their beans they don\'t offer anything that can make you remember the place forever.

To ensure a table, I called Thursday and made a reservation with a resounding "Sure thing!" from the girl on the other end. After arriving and giving them my name, however, they said it would be about 45 minutes until we\'d be seated, and that they "don\'t do reservations." Apparently, it\'s more of a waiting list, so whoever took my "reservation" probably should\'ve said something.\n\nA bit miffed, we sat in the bar area being bombarded with a deafening roar of country music. I had to yell to the server that I wanted a Blue Moon, and she said they don\'t serve it. (Really? It\'s a full bar; at least get bottles.) About 7 minutes after getting my sad replacement, our buzzer luckily jumped to life and we were off. Evidently, my unintentionally blurted-out comment of "WITH a reservation?" to the hostess after she told me the 45-minute wait-time suddenly made the line much shorter.\n\nOn our way down to the table, we kept bumping into kids who were literally running up and down the staircases and crashing into the hostess leading us. (The look on her face was priceless!) Apparently, people just let their kids run rampant through the restaurant and nobody tells them not to, and that\'s just normal -- you\'ve been warned.\n\nWe were relieved to find that our table was along the edge of the restaurant, right next to the windows overlooking the valley. It was a bit quieter over here and the view was great, but then we realized our server hadn\'t seen us and it had already been 8 minutes or so. Isn\'t the target goal to make contact within 2 minutes or less as wait-staff?\n\nShe seemed overworked and was taking quite awhile to come back and take our order/check on us throughout the night. She was still polite, though.\n\nWe had a coupon from their email club for a free-ish appetizer, so we chose hot wings. Some random dude brought them out to us and couldn\'t tell us which were hot and which were mild. As it turned out, 10 of them were hot and 2 were mild; go figure. They were okay; nothing to die for and I definitely wouldn\'t pay $10 for them.\n\nThe salad was dismal. It was pre-bagged iceberg mix with some sliced cucumber, cherry tomatoes, and fresh-from-the-box croutons. I tasted zero dressing whatsoever and wound up using the leftover ranch from the wings. The biscuits were a bit dry and needed butter desperately. The frybread was actually tasty, but the cinnamon-butter it came with was really unexpected, and the flavor combination with my meal once it came was awful.\n\nMy fianc\xe9e and I both ordered the prime rib. The prime rib itself was decent (again, like the wings) but I\'ve had much better for less money. It was tender but definitely past medium, which I ordered. It was pretty dry, too. There was no juice even puddled under the cut. Any true fan of prime rib sees this as a warning flag. Sides of seasonal veggies were blah; overcooked and needed salt and pepper. Their tacky, little pot of ranch beans just tasted like hot ketchup and brown sugar. We barely even touched them. Corn on the cob was waaayyy over-boiled. Pro-tip: Fresh corn on the cob only needs to be boiled about 3 minutes. Any more and you\'re killing it.\n\nPortion sizes were huge, but I would\'ve much rather had less food and actually enjoyed it thoroughly. Large portions at average quality make me kinda feel like I\'m being bought off as a customer. The worst part about that is they\'re still charging you a lot of money for the average quality you get.\n\nWith children running by us every 2 minutes and jumping all around the booths without anyone telling them not to, we got fed up by the end of our meal and had enough. Check took awhile to get to us, but again, our server was polite and apologized. I get the feeling either their management needs to be more proactive or someone didn\'t show up for work that night.\n\nPROS:\n- awesome, valley-wide views\n- live country music with dance floor\n- seems like a great happy hour place\n- polite server\n\nCONS:\n- no reservations and is absolutely PACKED on weekends; be warned\n- average food at steakhouse prices\n- big portions of food you won\'t fully enjoy\n- kids (like, not one family\'s, but a ton) running around everywhere like they own the place\n\nBOTTOM LINE:\n\nFeels really touristy and tacky and forced. Another restaurant pretending to be a casual steakhouse but sacrificing quality food for a family-restaurant atmosphere.

He looks concerned.\n\nThe space is split into two, but I\'m not sure how. I know this because when we asked for a table, the lady said that we could sit in some seats now, but other seats weren\'t available until later. I wasn\'t clear on which seats were available and which weren\'t, which concerned me greatly because then she said I could have a seat, and later I could have a different seat, which meant I had to figure out which seats were ok so we just sat near some other people. Eventually we switched to other seats, at which point, luckily, someone showed us where to sit.\n\nThe entire theme of this place is like, inside a barn or something. "Western Cowboy" or something like that.  Lots of wood, lots of steaks and meats, and people dressed \'country\' style or something like that. People were wearing boots and I don\'t think it was because they were outside hanging out with the cow.\n\nThe food was pretty good. People complain about their meat not being done like they ordered it, but for the love of dog, you\'re sitting in a giant barn and there\'s a cow outside - the strangest thing going on here isn\'t your meat being cooked a bit off.\n\nThe service was ok - they weren\'t busy at the time, but when we needed a spoon to dish out the sides with, that took about 5 minutes, which isn\'t a long time, but it feels like a long time when you\'ve got food sitting in front of you. I\'m also not saying the waitress didn\'t have something better to do - she did a good job - I don\'t know what was going on during those 5 minutes. Might have been problems with the cow or something. Just saying - it wasn\'t speedy.\n\nBut hey, the place has a great view. I\'d say to check it out, but it\'s not the kind of place I\'d bring a date unless I was already drunk. More of a family place or maybe there\'s some whole kind of country-western thing I don\'t know about, so if you\'re into that you might like checking it out too.

This was my daughters 4th birthday I read plenty great reviews on this place to help me choose this place to be her birthday dinner. We walk in see the bull the kids were excited we took the slide down to our table they absolutely loved that and then we get to our seat... We sit for awhile (10 min) waiting for someone to come over and the girls have to go to the bathroom so they leave to handle that I sit for another 5 minutes before the new waitress stumbles by and finally notices me. Asks what I\'d like to drink I give her my order and tell her it\'s my daughters birthday and I\'d like to order the birthday package (cake, photo, hat=$15)  yes that\'s right $15 for something other restaurants do for free. Anyways I order it while my daughters in the bathroom she said ok I\'ll go write it down right now I say thank you and we move along with our night. We had a decent dinner great band kept the kids happy it was sort of busy so we were patient with the waitress who mentioned she was new when we asked how to get the free meal for kids that\'s printed on the kids menu to ask the server about the free meal lol she had no idea. My daughter order a hot dog and fries it took 20 minutes to get ketchup but like I said it was busy so we were patient anyways they brought out our check brought out cotton candy I paid the bill and waited.. After 20 minutes or so after paying the bill we finally see the birthday song coming in our direction I pull out my camera to capture the special moment and it stopped a table before us hahaha jokes on us after they got done singing he waitress walked over asked if there was something else I needed I asked if they were still going to help us with my daughters birthday celebration and she started to apologize and say she completely forgot which is ok because like I\'ve stated twice before it was busy and she is human so things happen she then asks if we still wanted it or if we just wanted the cake lol I respond I mean if it\'s alright with you id still like more then just the dinner for my daughters birthday thinking I had already paid for it .. By this time both my kids heads are on the table from being tired it\'s 9pm and they have school/daycare tomorrow so they come back 15 minutes later sing the birthday song give us the cake and take the picture our waitress says they will be right back out with the picture and again apologizes for the mix up and keeping us waiting I say it\'s ok ask for a box and box up the cake because my little one was being crabby as you can see in the video so it was just best we left. We\'re headed out and the waitress runs up and gives us a new ticket saying that she updated the price since she forgot about the birthday I\'m thinking how nice of her to fix her mistake lol she updated the ticket and charged us for the horrible celebration that she forgot. Listen in the video as they stop in the middle of the song to ask her her birthday then asks how old she is . I told the lady she could get the manager because I wasn\'t paying for it and she responded Rudely saying "well I guess I\'ll just pay for it out of my tips" I left her $12 on the original ticket yes you should have to pay for your mistake the worst birthday dinner I\'ve ever seen. Great establishment but horrible waitress we will not be back. Sorry for the rant but she bummed a very important day for us. Did I mention after talking with the manager he apologized for her and also mentioned we don\'t get a hard copy of the photo like she said we just get to download it off their website lol the strangest $15 bday package I\'ve heard of.', 'business_id': 'wZwZcte4lcbu51NOzCjWbQ', 'stars': 1, 'date': '2015-10-25', 'type': 'review'}
