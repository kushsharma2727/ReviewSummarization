Humble Pie is one of this places Ive been waiting for since I read about it a year and a half ago. So today was their first public opening so with a spray of cologne and some plastic we were on our way!\n\nLet me tell you up front, this place is going to be packed for a while. We arrive around 6:30 pm and not a table to be had so we opted to sit at the bar. We had a pretty good vantage of the whole place.. from the warming boxes at the front to the wine cellar on the far part of the restaurant (I want one of those!). The space looks like it's not quite finished but you can tell and feel that the space is going to be very comfortable. \n\nTo start they offer wine flights, oh yeah honey.. thats what I'm talking about! Nothing like a nice heady wine buzz to get things started. Pouring over the menu was pretty easy.. there are a handful of apps, salads and pizza's. I started with the Grilled Steak Salad.. this salad is very good though the addition of some cheese would sent it over the top! We also ordered the Humble Caprese.. you know when your toes start to curl when you're about to uh, uhm.. well, ya know.. its sort of like that! Super creamy mozzarella, roasted cherry tomatoes on the vine.. it doesn't get much better, simple, clean and flavorful.\n\nPizza's.. Schreiners Sicilian Sausage with roasted Fennel.. Wild Mushrooms and Pancetta.. to start the crust.. light, slightly crisp, chewy, slightly salty in a good way.. for me, the crust here was nothing short of perfect.. it held the ample toppings nicely and of a nice chew and balance with the flavors of the topping. Sausage and Fennel was great plus nothing like sourcing locally! The Mushroom and Pancetta was a nice balance of earthy mushroom varieties and crispy salty pancetta. The mozzerella on the pizza's was the same heavenly pillow used on the Caprese.. beware, addictive!\n\nWe also received a mistake pizza of Pepperoni Pizza.. apparently we were in the right place at the right time since the guy next to us liked his mistake pizza (no sauce) so we were happy to take it off the waiters hands!  I'm not a fan of pepperoni, usually it's greasy limp and fatty. The pepperoni was crisp and well, I could eat one of these for breakfast!  I'm glad that kitchen had a few kinks to work out, this was a great mistake.\n\nOn to the desserts.. we tried the Olive Oil Gelato as well as the Fresh Berry Crostada. Having had Olive Oil Gelato at a place in LA called Mozza I was hoping that Humble's version would be better. It didn't disappoint! A very light taste of good olive oil surrounded in a creamy well textured gelato.. I would order this one over and over again! The Crustada was well done and since berries are in season this made for a nice treat.\n\nSo me and the Mister very much liked this place and want to fall in love.. so right now we are in the infatuation period.. we went ahead and made a reservation for tomorrow night.. I have plans on chowing down a Shrimp, Barrata pizza and or course, that marvelous pepperoni.", 'business_id': 'yypKLRJxSjR2uNaTS_O6pw', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2008-01-17', 'type': 'review'}

My co-worker and I went for lunch today after reading the mixed reviews on here, and I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised. I love Pizza, and if it was socially acceptable for me to eat it for every meal, I really would; I think that Humble Pie definitely meets my standards. \n\nWe sat outside on the patio, which normally I would love, accept for the mister/fan system combo, which made my straight- but naturally curly hair- frizz up in seconds. I was surprised to see the place relatively empty for 12:15 during the week, but I guess it\'s still "new." Our server, a young guy, greeted us right away with glasses of water, and had our other drinks to the table in seconds. Note to Humble Pie: if you leave the sweetener packets on the mystified tables- the sugar clumps together and doesn\'t come out of the packets! \n\nWe ordered the Chopped Vegetable Salad to start and it was amazing! Not heavy, a little tangy, a great mixture of veggies (Asparagus, white beans, cherry tomatoes\'), and the cheese was amazing! I\'m a big fan of the chopped lettuce! \n\nNext, we shared two Pizza\'s: Chicken Pesto with Leaks and the other was a simple Margahrita. Both, were very good! The mozzarella was fresh, the tomato sauce on the Margarita was tangy and smooth, and the Chicken on the Pesto Pizza was moist and delicious! Everything was seasoned perfectly and the crust had the perfect amount of crunch. \n\nThe pizza\'s are small, so I walked away feeling very satisfied and definitely wanting to go back! I bet at night this place is going to be packed! \n\nHurray for Humble Pie!!', 'business_id': 'yypKLRJxSjR2uNaTS_O6pw', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2008-04-29', 'type': 'review'}

However, this was more of a mistake on my part; I dislike gorgonzola intensely, and for some reason still thought it might be a good idea to order that pie, hoping that the gorgonzola would be minimal... it wasn't.  My bad :P.\n\nBut in addition to their delicious pizza is a fairly comprehensive wine and beer collection.  If you want to experience a zillion beers, this is not the place, but they do have something on tap for every palate, from hefeweizen to a nice IPA.", 'business_id': 'yypKLRJxSjR2uNaTS_O6pw', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2008-12-23', 'type': 'review'}

I had plans with Christina P and after reading her review, I asked if she'd be interested in returning to Humble Pie with me since she had several positive experiences there already...\n\nI arrived first, and was seated right away.  The staff was attentive and friendly - Alan was our server and took great care of us.  We started with  a glass of prosecco each and decided to share the brussel sprouts, cauliflower, and the shrimp pie.  Sounds like a ton of food, but it was perfect for the two of us.  I eat a lot - especially of veggies, and I love that HP has a large selection when it comes to veggies and salads... I have to return soon to try the butternut squash and the veggie salad (both sounded great to me).\n\nI'll preface this by saying, I like the flavor of burnt food.  So, the fact that the brussel sprouts were a tad bit overdone, was fine with me... although for other patrons, it may not be so appealing.  The cauliflower was not burnt, but it didn't have so much flavor either.  Regardless, I wanted to get my vegetables in for the day, and they seemed fresh despite the way they were cooked.  Does that make sense?\n\nAs some of the yelpers before me commented, we noticed the use of lemon zest in our shrimp pie.  It was light on the shrimp, sauce, and cheese, but it did have a zesty flavor to it.  I added some chili pepper flakes and parmesan as well... mmmm.\n\nAs if I hadn't eaten enough food, Christina requested a small sample of the olive oil gelato so I could taste it... and I actually enjoyed it!  If you're open to trying something new, the olive oil gelato is the perfect sweet ending to your meal at Humble Pie.\n\nMy 4 star rating is for my overall experience at Humble Pie - I was in fantastic company, a casual environment (which I love), and lots of veggie options to choose from... the pizza was fine - I'll try another selection next visit.\n\nI also noticed that there is plenty of bar seating for those that like to sit at the bar, hang with the bartender, etc... good to know in case I ever return solo!

But it was and always had been great! \nLast week I finally got the chance to actually go into a Humble Pie, this time Scottsdale one, and was once again very pleased with the results. \nA friend and I went on a Thursday evening I think around 730/ 8 pm or so and it was a little busy, but we didn\'t have to wait at all for a table. \nI really liked the atmosphere there, low lit, patio seating and even seating where you can watch the guys make your pizza, (how fun!) M y only gripe on seating was that I did feel a little close to the table beside us, as far as conversations and things, but for those that don\'t really mind "family style" seating (although thats not quite what they got going on, the tables are still really close) wont mind it at all. \nBeer on tap? Check. And some really good ones. There is nothing a enjoy more than being able to enjoy a local (AZ) brew. The wine list looked good as well. \nsome may think... gourmet pizza? Well fear not if you have a picky or \'I like the simple things in life" type eater, they can make some really really great pepperoni pizza as well. As for me, I prefer the prosciutto, pear and Gorgonzola cheese pizza with arugula. Wow. i always want to try one of their other creations, but usually end up with that one. I cant imagine ANY of their pizzas not being pretty darn good. \nService was good. The servers looked like they liked their job and were friendly. \nWord on the street was that Humble Pie has been trying to portray themselves as an "adult" pizzeria. And I could see that and I personally like the idea. There were children in there at the time I was and of course Humble Pie is very accommodating to them and all families, I just think they like more of the adult scene. \nSo to sum things up, I really like Humble Pie, it was a nice meal, not too pricey, great to take a date, but I\'m curious to check out the one on Tatum to see how the vibe there is.', 'business_id': 'yypKLRJxSjR2uNaTS_O6pw', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2009-04-13', 'type': 'review'}

The calamari is the traditional deep fried calamari...pretty standard, but delicious.\n\nOn to the pizzas.  One person can definitely eat one of the pizzas, but they are shareable if you're not into eating that much.  The crust is really what makes these pizzas good.  It kinda has this sourdough taste, but its crispy and just chewy enough where you aren't giving your jaw a workout.  My favorite pizza by far is the chicken pesto.  Its served with grilled cherry tomatoes and these phenom crunchy, crispy, salty onion strips on top.  The onion strips are the best.  The cheese and pepperoni pizzas are pretty standard, but tasty.  I've also tried their sausage pizza.  If you're into sausage, then this is for you...I think there are like three different types of sausages on top...pretty spicy and a real good taste.

I never tire of pizza simply because there are so many interpretations possible, and I'm not just talking about toppings.  From the flavorless cardboard pizzas from Peter Piper (for which I will always hold a place in my heart) to the foodie favorites crafted at world famous Pizzeria Bianco, Arizona is a pizza lovers paradise.  But among all of these various pies, my very favorite would have to be the Artichoke Pizza at Humble Pie.\n      Immediately upon walking into Humble Pie, you are immediately struck by the wood burning oven, where pizzas are being expertly spun in and out and onto your plate.  The heat from this oven allows your crust to be cooked within minutes, and produces a smoky black char that adds so much depth of flavor--this isn't the result of neglecting to set a timer.  The crust is able to develop this color not only because of the immense heat of the oven, but also because of fermentation of the dough.  Fermenting the dough not only aids in the cooking process, but also adds that slightly sour tang you can taste in the dough.  Developing flavors over days, rather than hours, is a testament to this restaurant's dedication to quality and taste.\n      With such a strong base, it's difficult to see how you could screw up such a good thing.  While I have enjoyed many different pizzas here, my all time favorite would have to be the Artichoke.  Delicate artichoke hearts are accented with gooey fontina cheese, mild fresh ricotta, sweet caramelized onions, with the briny bite of olives to cut through it all.   Other toppings range from just as creative to the traditional cheese or pepperoni.  But don't let traditional fool you into thinks average.  Humble Pie highlights local vendors in their locally made sausages and organically grown vegetables. Anytime there are less miles between the purveyor and your plate, there is almost a guarantee that the flavor will be better.\n      As for the rest of the menu, the burrata Caprese and antipasto platter starters are two of my favorites, and again highlight simple, quality ingredients.  Typically, my dining partner and I will split one of these and a pizza.  Salads are okay, but don't quite have the impact of the milky, gooey cheese of the Caprese.  I have not had their sandwiches or pasta dishes, but can only assume that with the quality of ingredients being used, there can't be much to complain about.  The kids' menu contains the usual suspects, but the pizza is of the same quality of the adult menu.  (Do be aware that the kids' macaroni and cheese is Kraft.)\n       The service is always friendly, with the owner stopping by your table often, and encourages leisurely meals.  I actually chose this venue to host my birthday party, which included around ten adults and four children under the age of five.  All of the orders were correct, the quality of food just as phenomenal as always, and they were incredibly helpful with our request of separate checks.  Overall, Humble Pie is one of my favorite spots in the Valley to enjoy myself with my family and good food.", 'business_id': 'yypKLRJxSjR2uNaTS_O6pw', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2010-11-27', 'type': 'review'}

I will say that if you\'re one of those "better than you" snobs who can\'t find satisfaction with anything, HP is probably not for you but for everyone else, it\'s worth a trip.\n\n In short, Humble Pie is all about friendly service and outstanding food, made fresh by hand every day, served hot and served quickly for a price that is more than fair. The atmosphere is casual, yet classy. You can go with buddies to watch the game, or you can take a date and still impress. The wine list is one of the better ones around unless you\'re on an unlimited budget.  The salads are huge (my wife and I split a small salad, and each half is bigger than a normal house salad at other places!) and delicious,and  the pizza is outstanding. They offer the old standards or you can be adventurous and order a more exotic Humble Pie original. The kids\' menu is about normal, but the food quality and quantity is outstanding. The "chicken fingers" were really four large chicken breast patties, pounded flat and lightly breaded. They were then covered with a large pile of tasty fries. I almost cancelled my pizza order and went with another order of the chicken! For dessert, I highly recommend the Chocolate Chip Ice Cream "pizza": A baked-to-order 6" or 8" cookie with two or three scoops of ice cream, chocolate sauce and whipped cream.\n\nThis place just lives up to it\'s name. The owner is almost always in-house and will likely stop by your table at least once and make sure you\'re satisfied. The wait staff is always smiling, and always willing to help. We\'ve never had a bad experience here. It is the antithesis of the typical stuck-up, nose-in-the-air Scottsdale prima-donna hang outs, which is probably why I like it so much. It\'s real people serving great food in a relaxed environment for a reasonable price.', 'business_id': 'yypKLRJxSjR2uNaTS_O6pw', 'stars': 5, 'date': '2010-12-25', 'type': 'review'}

Everything's consistently awesome, and I love their crust. I should copy and paste a few of these sentences over there to give them some good stars, but whatever. This review is about the Scottsdale location.\n\nDue to the restaurants not being where my friends live, not many of them have tried HP. I feel it's my duty to get some of the goat cheese pizzas into their bellies. So when en route to some pre-game drinking for a fancy holiday party that would leave my friends and me drunk (therefore needing alcohol-padding), I suggested we pick up some to-go pizza at this location. \n\nThe online ordering was simple, and my three pizzas and giant salad were ready when I got there. I didn't think to check my pizzas at this time, and they were unfortunately overdone. (Hey, it happens. *Kanye shrug*) \n\nWhen we called to see about fixing the order, the guy who answered the phone was easy to work with. Ultimately, my money was refunded for the entire order -- not just got the ultra-cripsy pizzas. The gesture was much-appreciated. \n\nMany thanks, Humble Pie in Scottsdale.

Yes, I understand that the register is ringing them up that way and repeating that 2x doesn't make it ok.  Sometimes it's how you handle a situation that makes all the difference.  \n\nOn top of the service issues, the pizzas always look and smell great upon arrival, but they have been disappointing the last couple of times.  Great selection of toppings and variety of pizzas, HOWEVER, it does you no good when you can't taste them with wet dough.

Since they were celebrating their anniversary and pizzas were half price, seemed a good time to go.  It was quite crowded but managed to grab a couple seats at the bar.  Caught the end of happy hour and enjoyed $2 Bud Light drafts and excellent french fries for $3 as one of the happy hour appetizer specials.  The bartender warned us that the fries were good sized orders and maybe we wanted to split  an order, but we were starved and each got an order, and its a good thing we did, as the pizzas were on the small side.  We got an S.O.P. (sausage, carmelized onions, and roasted red peppers) and a Mushroom with sausage.  But despite my ordering my S.O.P well done, it came out with a rather soggy on the inside crust. The toppings were fresh and tasty, but my preference is for a crisp thin crust.\nI would say compared to the Fallen Angel pizza at La Grand Orange\n( which is similar to the S.O.P)  I would have to give the edge to LGO because of their crispier crust.  However, I like the ambiance at Humble Pie over LGO......its more like being in a real restaurant/bar.

I could end my review there, but my mystery "fans" might be disappointed.\n\nWe had a late lunch on a Sunday afternoon, and the place was almost empty.  I\'m glad about that because I didn\'t care for the layout of the dining room.  Unless the room had been set up for a large group that had left, with the exception of counter seating and a few four-top pub tables, all the seating was 2 long rows of small tables placed about 6 inches from each other.  Although it does make it easy to set up tables for groups of any size, I\'m not fond of sitting on a stranger\'s lap generally.  \n\nWe started with a small caprese plate with house-made burrata, pesto, cherry tomatoes, balsamic, and ciabatta toasts.  We were starving, so we devoured it pretty quickly, leading the server to comment "you finished that already?"  Yes, we did, it was a small, and it was delicious.  But I appreciated her not outright saying, "wow, nice job fat-ass."\n\nNext up was the potato and roasted garlic pizza with fontina, gorgonzola, leeks, rosemary, and the addition of prosciutto.  My husband insisted I choose the pizza, and I loved every bite of it!  And the best part was I loved every bite of it because he didn\'t.  So I generously suggested he order another pizza knowing I would have it all to myself.  He went with the pepperoni.  Although they are very generous with the pepperoni, it\'s still just a pepperoni pizza.  The sauce was a little sweet for me, but I prefer a spicier sauce.  Can\'t wait to come back and try the pistachio pizza.  And for the record, no soggy crust!\n\nSuffice it to say...Yum.', 'business_id': 'yypKLRJxSjR2uNaTS_O6pw', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2011-03-02', 'type': 'review'}

While it's certainly not terrible, you can definitely find better.  The quality of the pizza tends to be somewhat inconsistent  and at times can be quite good while at other times we've received a soggy crust with toppings that look like the kitchen staff must have had a contest to see who could stand on the other side of the kitchen and toss the most ingredients onto the crust (sadly, most of them missed).\n\nThe veggie salad was good and had interesting ingredients like avocado, green beans, white beans, and jicama that added enough zing to make the salad less than boring.  The caesar salad, however, was another story.  We were about halfway through eating it when we finally pinpointed the source of the strange taste and texture that is unfamiliar to a typical caesar.  About 1/3 of what is normally romaine lettuce actually consisted of chopped celery, which in my opinion, has no place in a caesar salad.  I'm not sure if this was just an attempt at cutting costs by adding a cheap filler ingredient, but the result was anything but delicious.\n\nOn a positive note, they do offer half priced bottles of wine on Mondays, but overall, this is just an average pizza restaurant.", 'business_id': 'yypKLRJxSjR2uNaTS_O6pw', 'stars': 3, 'date': '2011-06-17', 'type': 'review'}

The oven is in everyone\'s view, as well as an open kitchen plus several sports televisions throughout the restaurant. It is a wonderful place to go if you\'re looking for a laid-back, low-key atmosphere that doesn\'t skimp on the quality of food.\n\nFor starters, my pal and I shared the freaking huge "small" veggie salad ($6.95), which was probably one of the best house salads I\'ve ever had. It had jicama, avocado, corn, tomatoes, green and white beans and house made mozzarella, and I got it with ranch. The combination of all those yummy veggies was amazing.\n\nThen for dinner, we each got our own pizzas, and I tried both. Based on the big portion of the salad, we should have split one pizza, because we both ended up taking half of our 12-inch pies home. I got a cheese pizza ($9.95) with tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese, and I added goat cheese and olives to it ($2 each). The goat cheese was so flavorful, and the consistency of the dough was soft and chewy, like I like it. I thought my order was really great.\n\nMy pal got the artichoke pizza ($12.95), which came sauceless with fontina and ricotta cheese, caramelized onions and olives. We both wished there would have been sauce on the pizza, but his also tasted great with the variety of cheeses.\n\nI think the restaurant is a great deal for the portions it gives you, and I\'ll definitely be going back soon.', 'business_id': 'yypKLRJxSjR2uNaTS_O6pw', 'stars': 4, 'date': '2012-07-09', 'type': 'review'}

Red peppers are too dominant: they overpowered the clams, which should have been the focal point here.\n\nReally, it's not a bad place.  As far as small local pizza chains are concerned, it is miles ahead of Sauce.

For appetizers I ordered the toasted ravioli,  they were stuffed with ricotta cheese and served with marinara sauce. To be honest this dish lacked flavor, Prego sauce has more flavor that the marinara sauce that came with it.  1/2 the raviolis were toasted perfectly, the other were just hard. Even though the dish looked great the dish didn't wow me.\n \nMy son ordered the lasagna, which was the winning dish of the night, everything cooked perfectly!  His date ordered the Penne with Vodka Sauce with chicken (5 buck upcharge, when it came out it looked like adding the chicken to the dish was an afterthought, it was just a chicken breast diced up lying on top of the pasta. The sauce had great color but lacked flavor. \n\nSince I was at Humble Pie, pie is what I am getting right?  Wood oven cooked pizza sounded amazing!  I ordered the bbq chicken pizza with smoked mozzarella, bacon, fontina, green onions and bbq sauce, the bbq chicken is one of my favorite types of pizza, so I was pretty excited. When I got my pizza it looked pretty amazing, but when I started to eat it, I noticed it was covered with grease, even my crust was soaked in grease, I couldn't eat it all, my belly was becoming a grease pit, it was just too much for me.  \n\n\nOur server was never around (it wasn't that busy) the food was ok, the place looks like a lot of fun, the lasagna rocked, but my return rate very low.", 'business_id': 'yypKLRJxSjR2uNaTS_O6pw', 'stars': 2, 'date': '2013-11-25', 'type': 'review'}

They make their own mozzarella cheese and it is excellent.  Their wood fired pizzas are really good, but $13 for the size served it a little too much $$...... they need to get it down to about $10 or else increase the size of the pizza.

We started off with the caprese salad and chicken drumettes. The caprese salad is deconstructed and nothing to rave about. The chicken drumettes were completely flavorless. We literally doused them in ranch to get some flavor out of them. Next, we had a Cesar salad. Super simple, definitely not worth the $12 and again, had to add lemon juice, salt and pepper in order for it to be palatable. Lastly, we ordered the S.O.P pizza but our waitress accidentally put in the order for a pepperoni pizza. She asked if we still wanted the original pizza we ordered and we said yes because the pepperoni pizza did not look appetizing at all! The pepperoni was stacked one on top of the other, they didn't even take the time to spread them out evenly. Once we got our pizza, it was clear that it would be a disappointment like the rest of our food. You literally can't pick up a slice without having all of the cheese and toppings slide off and it appeared to be undercooked.

Occupaccy was at a mere 20% on friday night, 2 other tables with children. Tables were stickly when we sat down, we were told it was because the tables had old varnish.  Soda was flat, replaced with a second glass of flat soda.  Childs pizza had black bubbles on the crust and over baked brown cheese.  Okay for an adult but unappealing to a child.  We agreed to box the childs pizza and have it replaced with plain spaghetti, no sauce, no meatballs. Ended the meal with warm cookies with ice cream, this too was over baked, but wonderful for a 4 year old.  We were surprised when we received our bill.  We were charged for 2 childs meals and for the flat soda.  The waitress stated that it was the managers (bartenders) decision.  All said and done 80.00, and I might give it a second try but only if all other options were exhausted.  I actually prefer Little Chicago on Hayden and McDowell for the same pizza and sandwhich options or Bashas on Hayden and Induan School for a fire baked pizza.  The ONLY redeeming factor was really good french fried potatoes, good Stella and we did get upfront parking.
